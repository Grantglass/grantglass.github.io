INTRODUCTION 


N EABLY all the work of Danidi Defb% 
even the earliest, shows that narrativa' 
was the kind of writing for ,whkh he 
was fitted by nature. Yet D^ie was 
more than a good story-teller. He was also a moral- 
ist, an essayist, a journalist, an enthusiastic and fiuriy 
shrewd business man, a patriot, a trusted adviser 
a king, and an unscrupulous political ^y. Few 
readers of Sobmaon Cnuoe realise what a vuied and 
remarkable life was that of its author; few realise 
how late in life it was that he hit on the kind of 
writing whidi has given him his greatest fiune. . 

Daniel Defoe was bom in the parish of St. Gileah* 
Cripplegate, probably in 1669, though the date is 
given also as 1660 and 1661. His .&tber was a 
butdier named James Foe, a Londoner ; bis grand- 
father se^inji;^;^ be^«,VMhaffl|Miise y«^ 
man. The family were dissent^ thfcSRlDr8ort'.V 
plain, religious, conscioitious people as the En^iah 
colonists of the time in New Englaad. HefiK, ec- 
oordbigly, was sent to a NoDoonfiHviut apedhi ny at 
Newington Green, to be educated for the. R es enting 
ministry. Though he did not fhlffl tiie hoj^ of his

said to ha\e got a fairly good education at the acad- 
emy. Report has it that he obtained knowledge of 
Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish. It 
should be remarked, however, as Sir Walter Besant 
has pointed out,^ that since Defoe, even in his most 
serious writings, never shows signs of sihoLirship, 
it IS questionable whethei he took full advan- 
tage of his opportunities for education Inci- 
dentally it may he noted that the principal of the 
academy at Newington Green, Charles Morton, sub- 
sequently migrated to New England, where he 
became a minister at Charlestown and one of the 
Corporation of Harvard t’ollege. In stock and 
training, then (or at least opportunities for train- 
ing), Defoe must have been like the Ixdter-edu- 
cated New Englanders of his day. 'J'his fact ma) 
explain why, in Ins life and writings, he shows more 
Yankee chaiacten sties than any other inipoitant 
Queen Anne writer. Unfortunately it must be said 
that they are too often cbaracteiistics of the unsciu- 
pulous, vulgar, commercial Yankee of nineteenth- 
century literaiy and theatiical convention

seems to have left the academy at Newington to 
place himself in the establishment of a hose-ilealer,

trips to Spain and I’ortugaJ. I’eihaps Defoe trav-

INTRODUCTION 


elled in these countries when Monmouth’s rebellion 
had failed, and the supporters of the unfortunate 
duke, among "whom was our author, had taken either 
to flight abroad or hiding at home. However this 
may be, about two yeara after the rebellion, Defoe 
was established in business near London. Too much 
speculation, apparently, in time got him into difficul- 
ties, and by 1692 he had failed and was obliged to flee 
from his creditors to Bristol. Defoe’s subsequent 
conduct in regard to the matter was honourable; 
he IS said to have paid his creditors conscien- 
tiously , but his behaviour at Bristol was not pleasing. 
Though danger of arrest kept him in his house every 
day except Sunday, when he did go out, he was al- 
ways elegantly, if not ostentatiously, dressed — so 
much so, that he became famous as “the Sunday 
gentleman.” Heie we have an early instance of 
Defoe’s want of fine feeling and of his fondness for 
show, two of his most disagieeablc traits. 

When Defoe fii>t took to political writing is uncer- 
tain. Probably in the reign of James II., possibly 
ill that of Charles II., he began to write pamphlets 
of the kind that in thosc^ days took the place of 
the leading articles of our journals. After the Rev- 
olution of 1688, his pamphlets became more fre- 
quent. In 1695, in reward for his support of the 
government, he was made accountant to the Com- 
missioiiei's of the Gletss Duty — a position which he 
retained till 1699. In the meantime (in 1698) the 
first of his important works was published, the Es- 
say wpon Pnyects, a work which seems to have been

written se\eia1 years earlier. This is interesting in 
many ways. It contains a fairly able dissertation 
on the pnnciples of trade; in its suggestion.s for 
an academy to goxeni the English tongue, for the 
improvement of roads, for the institution of an acad- 
emy fill the higher education of women, and the 
like, it not only manifests the spirit of the age foi 
organisation and reform, but frequently shows itself 
in advance of the age ; and most important of all, in 
the concrete illustrations drawn from homely life, 
with which Defoe makes his theoretical discussion 
interesting, the essay shows the power, indispensable 
to a realistic story-teller, of depicting scenes vividly. 

The days of Defoe’s greatest prosperity were now 
at hand William III., a Dutchman, was thought 
by many Englishmen to have the interests of Hol- 
land more at heart than those of England. Ac- 
cordingly, he and his Dutch friends weic variously 
lampooned, especially in a pamphlet in verse pub- 
lished on the first of August, 1700. entitled The 
Foreigners, n'lnch taxed them with being wholly out 
of sympvthy with th'-ir adopted couiiti>. At the 
beginning of the next >ear Defoe answered this 
pamphlet vigoi ously w ith his Trtte-Born Fnglishman 
in doggerel verse, in which he .showed satirically that 
the Engli.sh were a hybrid race, and that the king, 
with his Dutch blood, had as good a right to call 
himself English as Englishmen of mixed Celtic, 
Danish, and Norman blood. The people took the 
satire good-naturedly. It raised the king in then 
estimation, and it raised Defoe in the king’s. He

wa>. received in audience by William, who remained 
till his death a friend to Defoe. 

It was apparently about this time, or a year or 
two afterwards, that the son of the butcher Foe took 
to writing his name De Foe or Defoe. Some biog- 
raphers have thought the change accidental — that 
De Foe was <iiiginally a mistake for D. Foe. The 
best opinion, howevei, is that Defoe made the change 
intentionally in oirier to give his iiaiiic a less plebeian 
look A desire thus to conceal the humbleness of his 
origin «ould not be inconsistent with the innate vul- 
garity of the man. 

With the death of William III. in March, 1702, 
Defoe’s most prosperous day.H were over ; before the 
year was out, he had got into trouble with the Tory 
House of Commons. The country w’as now feeling 
a Torv reaction, and as sentiment against the Dis- 
senters grew stronger and stronger, Defoe was moved 
to come to their aid with his ironical pamphlet, 
The Shortest Way with the Dissenters Strange as 
it may seem to-day, this was taken in earnest, and 
the high Tones commended it. The first of the 
pamphlet, indeed, might be mistaken , for the fable 
of the cock roosting on a stable floor who says 
to the horses, “ Pray, gentlefolks, let us stand still, 
for fear we should tread upon one another,” was 
aimed at the foolish arrogance of some Nonconform- 
ists. But as the pamphlet progres.ses, the propo- 
sitions become so extreme that it seems impossible, 
as Defoe wrote later in A Brirf Explanation of a 
Late PatAphlet entitled The Shortest Way with the 
[ xiii 1 



INTRODUCTION 


Dissenters, “ to imagine it hliould pass for anything 
but a banter upon ti»e high-flying churchmen.” 

When the truth was discoxered, the House of 
Commons was shamed into declaring a slander what 
many high-churclimeu had aheady praised. A pros- 
ecution of Defoe was begun. The pamphlet was 
condemned as seditious, and its author, on giving 
himself .up, was sentenced to jmy a fine of two 
hundred inaiks, stand three times in the pillory, and 
then go to prison for the queen’s plcasuie. 

Part of this punishment Defoe, with characteristic 
shrewdness, conveited from a disgrace into a triumph. 
Before the three days came in July, 1703, when he 
stood in the pillory, he had wiitten the best verse 
which ever came from his pen, his Hymn to the 
PiUory. In lines to which righteous wrath had 
given some real dignity, Defoe denounced his ene- 
mies, some of whom, he declared, ought to be stand- 
ing where he then stood. Defoe had copies of the 
poem circulated among the crowd which came to 
see him The combined effect of these and the 
symjinthv which the masses already felt for him was 
to make his punishment an ovation. Fiuits and 
flowers were presented to him and garlands hung 
about the pillory. 

Once in Newgate, however, and no longer stimu- 
lated by the popular ovation, Defoe must have felt 
his fortunes at a \erv low ebb. When William was 
still king, Defoe had bceome the proprietor of an 
establishment, which grew to lx; very successful, for 
making bricks and tiles, near Tilbury in Essex. This 
[xiv J 



INTRODUCTION 


was now necessarily closed. And so Defoe found 
himself without an established business and an in- 
definite imprisonment before him. 

Even in this desperate situation, he turned cir- 
cumstances to his advantage. From his prison he 
brought out several pamphlets urging peace and 
moderation between the hostile political parties. 
He wrote a graphic account of the famous storm 
which swept England in November, 1703, an account 
which must be partially fiction, for Defoe, shut up 
in Newgate, could have had little expenence of the 
actual violence of the tempest. More important yet, 
he started in February, 1704, the Weekly Review of 
the Affaire of France^ which lasted until 1718. It 
was published first once, then twice, and finally three 
times a week, and treated of both foreign and domes- 
tic matters which, according to Defoe, were affected 
by French events. An important part of the paper 
was the Mercure Scandale, which, with its discussion 
of various social que.stioiis, was a sort of forerunner of 
the Tatler, and Spectator, and their many successors. 

Better times were now coming for Defoe. In the 
spring of 1704, the Whigs and moderate Tories 
supplanted the extreme Tories in power, and Harley 
became important in the government. This minister, 
who interceded for Defoe’s release in April, freed 
him, it would seem, in May.* From now on, in 

' The date of Defoe’s release has commonly been given as 
August Mr Thomas Bateson in Th$ Relatione of Defoe and^

INTRODUCTION 


spite of diflTerence of political opinion, Defoe was 
Harley's faithful follower. 

For the next fifteen years, politics occupied the 
most important position in Defoe’s life. He was 
employed as a secret agent of the government by 
Harley, and also by the Whig ministers after Harley 
had been forced to give up his office. He was sent 
to Scotland to help make arrangements for the union 
of that kingdom with England , and he made two 
subsequent flips to the same place on matters re- 
lating to the Union. He also made two or thiee 
trips on secret government business through the 
English provinces. As Defoe was in the service of 
ministers on both sides, it made little difference to 
him which party was in power. When the political 
changes of 1710 brought back the Tories with Harley 
at -their head, Defoe served them as well as he had 
served the Whigs m the years immediately preceding. 
In fact, though an apparently sincere Whig on the 
questions of civil and religious libertv, on the epics- 
tion of the French War he stood with the moder- 
ate Tones Like Swift, he advocated an early peace, 
though he did not approve of the terms finally 
agreed upon. 

The extreme Tories brought about the downfall 
of Defoe’s patron, Harley, in July, 1714; w'lthin 
three weeks the queen died, and Greorge I was pro- 
claimed king. On this accession of the House of 
Hanover, it was once supposed that Defoe’s political 
• life ended. It is now certain, however, that he con- 
tinued his political career, though in an underhand

INTRODUCTION 


way, for which his relations with Harley had well fitted 
him He became, in short, a Whig spy. After the 
Jacobite rising of 1715, the Whig ministers induced 
Defoe to appear as a Tory writer, in order to get 
into the confidence of certain Tory editors and to 
temper the extreme sentiments of their papers. The 
paper with which Defoe was longest connected was 
Mist's Journal^ a weekly publication, whose editor 
Defoe deceived for years. When Mist found out 
the true state of afiaii's, the result was the end of 
Defoe’s political career. 

Meanwhile Defoe had not given over his non- 
political interests. In 1706 appeared one of the 
most vivid bits of narrative that ever came from his 
pen — the Apparition of one Mrs. Veal ... to one 
Mrs. Bargrave. He kept his hand in at semi- 
fictitious narrative by introducing popular illus- 
trations into his political writings, and by composing 
histones of contemporary events clothed in semi- 
fictitious garb Such, for instance, was A Short 
Narrative of the Life and Death (f John RhinhtAdi^

old story of the Swedish king’s cruelty, to stir up 
hostility against Sweden, whose ambassador in

INTRODUCTION 

London had turned out to be an emissary of the 
Pretender. 

At last, when Defoe was in the neighbourhood of 
sixty, he took to the kind of writing which makes 
him famous to-day. The wonder is not so much 
that he wrote something like a novel then as that 
he did not write it earlier, foi his whole career, we 
have seen, shows an ability foi realistic fiction, llis 
power to attain persuasive reality is apparent in the 
graphic illustrations of his essays and political writ- 
ings, and in his misunderstood iionv of The Shortext 
Way with the Dieseiiters^ no less than in his early bits 
of narrative It is not unnatural, therefore, that he 
should have brought out a long narrative on April

INTRODUCTION 


is not by his moralising that Defoe lives. In the 
meantime he had published, in addition to other 
writings, three narratives, or so-called “novels,” two 
of them of considerable length — a number which 
mak.cs it probable that Defoe had partially composed 
them before the publication of the first part of Rohvn- 
mn Crusoe. For the rest of his life Defoe’s main 
work was writing his “novels." 

There is some mystery about the last days of De- 
foe. Though fairly well-to-do, and apparently liv- 
ing in comfort and happiness with his wife and 
ihildren at Stoke Newington, he fled thence for 
some reason — perhaps on account of money diffi- 
culties, perhaps on account of mental derangement 
— and for a year before Ins death, he lived in a sort 
of concealment. He died in April, 1731. 

Defoe 18 a singular chaiacter among our men of 
letters. There was in him a lack of fine feeling, an 
intrinsic vulgarity, manifest as well in his political 
deceits as in his fondness for attracting attention, 
and in his attempt, b\ changing his name, to make 
his family out better than it w as. Professing to be 
a moralist, he always had an eye for the main 
chance , and at times he had a convenient way of 
suppressing his opinions — without actually chang- 
ing them — for the sake of money. Were he alive 
to-day, w'e should expect him to be either a very 
“ yellow ” journalist or a theatrical or circus man- 
ager, unrivalled for sensational, unscnipulous ad- 
vertising, And yet, so far as we know, Defoe was 
an upright man in his family relations -, he was a 
[xix } 



INTRODUCTION 


man of indomitable courage ; and in politics, if 
not always openly, he was yet consistently, and ap- 
parently conscientiously, a Whig, at a time when 
the Whigs saved English liberty, and when political 
steadfastness was what few public men could boast 
of Either his political seinices or Ins journalistic 
work would entitle him to a place in the Dictionary 
of National Biograpliy, but more than the two com- 
bined, his prose fiction puts him there. In the 
history of our literature, he is impoi’tant chiefly for 
his influence on that kind of writing which, within 
twenty yeai's of his death, was to come, in the works 
of Fielding, as near perfection as it has ever come. 

In Rohinson Crmoe, his fiisl considerable attempt 
at Action to lie published, Defoe cannot be said to 
have invented a new kind of wnting. Like most 
of his narratives, this belongs, binadly speaking, to 
the division of literature known as the “ picaresque 
novel,’’ a kind of fiction which arose in Spain in the 
sixteenth century. The LusanUo de Tormex, the first 
of the kind, was published in 1553 Written in the 
first person, as if auti'biogi-nphical, it tells how its 
hero, whom we see first a poor boy of eight, passed 
through various adventures, trusting to his wits to 
extricate him from such difficulties as he got into. 
The LazanUo met with much favour both at home 
and abroad , before the century was out, it was 
translated into German, Fiench, and English Imi- 
tations followed, all, like the onginal, dealing with 
the fortunes of clever rogues or adventurers. The 
most important of these in England before the 



INTRODUCTION 


eighteenth century was The English Rogue, by 
Richard Head and Francis Kirkman, which came 
out in four parts during Defoe’s boyhood.^ 

What Defoe did in Robinson Crusoe that was new 
111 picaresque novels was to send his hero to a desert 
island in the trapics, thus setting a fashion for 
“ desert-island ” tales that has lasted to our own 
day. For this novelty he wa.s doubtless indebted to 
the story of Alexander Selcraig (or Selkirk, as he 
has been more often called), a Scotchman, who spent 
four years and four months alone on the island of 
Juan Fernandez off the coast of Chile. This Sel- 
craig, who was making a voyage round the world 
with Captain Dampier, as sailing-master of one of 
his two ships, the Cinque Ports, chose to stay on 
the island rather than continue with the captain 
of his ship, a certain Stradling, with whom he had 
(jiiarrelled. From the solitary life which ensued 
Selcraig was rescued in February, 1709, by Captain 
Woodes Rogers in command of the Duke, a ship 
fitted out at Bristol for an expedition against the 
French and Spanish. Rogers published an aa-ount 
of his travels in 1712, in which he tells the story of 
Selcraig. In The Englishman in December, 1713,* 
Steele, who had interviewed the desert-islander, pub- 
lished another account of his adventures. And so 
it will be seen that Defoe had good opportunity to 
become acquainted with the story of Selcraig.

appendix to the third volume of this edition.

INTRODUCTION 


As a result of Defoe’s acquaintance with this 
storVj we have in the first part of RtMnson Crusoe 
what IS, with one exception, the most artistic long 
nan-ative from Ins pen Here is an apparent unity, 
rare alike in Defoe’s otlier stones and in most picar- 
esque tales of adventure. The reason is that once 
the hero reaches his desert island, his adventures 
are of necessity limited ; all that happens now bears 
on one question — how is he going to suppoi’t him- 
self without human aidf* From this all-important 
question we never get away. Moreover, as a soli- 
tary on a desert island would naturally find in- 
terest in the most trivial details, Defoe's enumeration 
of unimportant incidents lioes not become tedious 
or exaggerated, as it too often docs in his other 
works. It seems only natural and proper; it adds 
to the probability of the story. 

From the nature of its subjw t, RMnsou Crusoe 
derives something more than a kind of artistic unity. 
When Crusoe, in his Farther Adventures, speaks of 
“the life I lived m my kingdom, the island, where I 
suffered no more corn to grow because I did not want 
it , and bred no more goats, because I had no more 
use for them ; where the money lay in the drawer 
till it grew mouldy, and had svarce the favmur to be 
looked upon in twenty years” — when Crusoe speaks 
thus, he touches on a kind of life which, however 
impossible, has always had some charm for civilisa- 
tion-wearied man. This charm and the skill of the 
story-teller together produce that deep interest in 
the first part of Robimon Crusoe which seems likely to 
[ xxii ] 



INTRODUCTION 


last as long as the English tongue. It is, to a large 
extent, this interest in his island adventures which 
makes us glad to follow Crusoe in his Farther Ad- 
ventures (published only four months later) through 
China, Si^ria, and Russia. But with all our pre- 
possession in his favour, we find it hard to keep up 
our interest when we come to his Serious Rejkctions. 
It matters not that this gives us some information 
about the author’s personal history, as in his declar- 
ing — probably untruthfully — that the Adventures 
of Robinson Cnusoe was meant for an allegorical 
history of his own life. The Serious Rejlections 
. . of Rohhisoti Crusoe. With his Vteion of the 
Angelic World is exceedingly hard reading. 

Even the charm of the peaceful island life and 
the unitv of the narrative would ndt sustain our 
interest in the first part of Robinson Crusoe, were it 
not for the intense reality of its scenas — a reality 
characteristic of Defoe’s work. Similar reality is 
apparent in the Farther Adventures of Robinson 
CnMoe, and at least to some extent in every bit of 
fiction which Defoe ever wrote The secret of it is" 
that Defoe had an unbounded imagination for fact. 
It Is not enough that Defoe tells us that Cinisoe 
stripped to shirt, drawers, and shoes, the second 
time he swam out to the wreck. No, he says that 
Crusoe had “ nothing on but a chequered shirt and 
a pair of linen drawers,-anda pair of piiinps.” And 
so Defoe almost alw'ays goes into minute details, 
adding one little fact to another, till a reader feels 
that the man must be telling what he has seen him- 
[ xxiii ] 



INTRODUCTION 


self. He even goes beyond minutise. Whether as 
a finished artist, or as a hasty writer who allowed 
himself no time for excision, Defoe is a past master 
at giving unnecessary detail. 

Moreover, Detbe was such a careful student of 
geography, he was so well read m books of travel, 
that he has seldom made mistakes in his geographical 
facts. Now and then he makes a slip, but for the 
most part, he writes of the Barbary States, North 
America, South America, Madagascar, the East 
Indies, the South Seas, China, or Siberia, as if he 
had visited the regions he desenbes. His interest 
in such distant regions, and in the connection of his 
country with them, marks him as one of the earli- 
est “ irapenalists ” of the English race. 

Marvellous reality of scene, a verisimilitude in de- 
tached incidents unsurpassed and almost unequalled 
in English fiction, is not the only product of Defoe’s 
imagination for fact. Because his imagination so 
seldom goes beyond fact, he has seldom succeeded 
in imparting reality to a story as a whole. While 
we read, we accept as real each particular ev'ent, but 
when we come to the end of the book, we do not 
feel that we have had a bit of real life. The leason 
is that, to the majority of people, fact is not the 
whole of life Mo.st of us are more emotional 
than Defoe or the creatures of his fiction. Most 
of us, for example, would have felt more romantic 
despair than Crusoe at his loneliness , had we been 
in his place, we should have felt oftener such 
piercing sorrow as came over him when he found 

[ XXIV ] 



INTRODUCTION 


that no one was saved from the wrecked Spanish 
ship. 

Because Crusoe had so little emotion, is one reason 
that he is nut individual. He is, as critics have 
been pleased to remark again and again, just a typi- 
cal, common-sense, practical, English colonist, who 
sets to work with all his ability to make the most he 
can out of existing conditions. As such, he is true 
to life so far as the representative of a type can be, 
but the representative of a type is not an individual 
human being. Defoe had not the kind of imagina- 
tion which would give his characters individuality. 
He tried hard to do so, and in some. instances, no 
doubt, prided himself on his character-di awing. I 
am inclined to think that he felt he had succeeded 
in individualising Friday, and William, the Quaker, 
in Captain Singleton, and several others of his per- 
sonages ; but to me they are all wooden. The least 
so are two of his women, Moll Flandeis and Roxana, 
but even they are far from thoroughly vitalised. 
Though Defoe could give peifect reality to inci- 
dents, he could not impart life to his characters. 
Not even the best known of them, Robinson Crusoe 
himself, ever “ walks out of the page” (if I may use 
this overworked expression) as do Fielding’s char- 
acters and a good many of Smollett's. 

It is partly on account of Defoe's inability to 
make his characters real that some critics have been 
unwilling to coll his stones novels. There is another 
reason why we should refuse this name to them. 
As I have tned to point out in the introductions 

[ XXV j 



INTRODUCTION 


to Fielding’s works, by a novel we commonly 
understand to-day a book that one reads not only 
for the persuasive resility of its scenes and char- 
acters, but also for its plot. Not every novel by 
any means has real characters, real scenes, and a 
good plot ; but in the best novels, you will find 
these three elements happily united. The only one 
of them which we see distinctly in Defoe’s woiks is 
reality of scene. I’here is no more plot, there aie 
no more living persons in his stones, than there arc 
in most medneval romances, in which the story- 
teller made conventional knights and ladies go 
through adventures that he terminated summarily 
or continued indefinitely, as he saw fit. It is chiefly 
in the fact that their incidents are possible, and 
that their characters are seen in the garish light 
of hfiuible realism and not in a knightly mediseval 
glamour, tliat the stories of Defoe (and indeed 
picaresque stories in general) differ from the lo- 
mances of the Round Table. Robvnmm Crusoe and 
Colonel Jacque are no more organic than the medie- 
val Merlin or Sir Larwelol du JjxKe , nor have they 
more vivified characteis. They are not novels in 
the sense that Tom Jones and Humphry Clinker are 
novels. Professor Miiito is right in declaring that 
Defoe’s narratives are not realistic novels but real- 
istic biographies.^ 

It by no means follows from this that Defoe’s 
naiTatives are not intere.stuig. From the beginning 
of literature, men have liked to read about the ad-

ventures of other men. We like to read of them as 
befalling either in the civilised sodety with which 
we are familiar, or (even as our mediaeval ancestors 
in the days of Marco Polo) in distant lands which 
few white people have seen. There is no reason to 
suppose that this fondness for reading of adventure 
IS not a permanent attribute of the human race. 
Now in Defoe's stories, adventures fol}ow one another 
with that quick movement which has always been 
characteristic of the best narrative. Till human 
nature changes, therefore, Defoe’s narratives, plotless 
and mostly characterless though they be, are likely 
to possess interest for readers. 

Defoe’s stones have yet another permanent claim 
to infSwt ni being the first good examples in Eng- 
lish of the picaresque novel, whose history I have 
already sketched in this introduction. In the eigh- 
teenth century, before Fielding showed that the 
English novel was a literary form unsurpassed for 
picturing actual life, there had been two different 
promises of what the novel might be. On the one 
hand, there were the sketches of “ polite ” society 
which Addison and Steele had made in vaiious 
numbers of their periodicals, especially in the Sir 
Roger de Coverley papers — sketches which peopled 
diawing-rooms, clubs, and country-houses with real 
personages. Had the incidents which these early 
essayists related been connected by a plot, we should 
have had our first English novel a good thirty years 
before Joseph Andrews. The other early eighteenth- 
century promise for the English novel is found in 
[ xxvii ] 



INTRODUCTION 


the picaresque stories of Defoe with their humble, 
vulgar realism. What the development of the Eng- 
lish novel would have been without the picaresque 
element, it is impossible to say. Perhaps it would 
have been charged with the forced, hot -house atmos- 
phere which we breathe in Richardson's didactic- 
novels : we should hardly have got the stronger aii 
— sometimes sweet with country freshness, again, 
heavy with tobacco smoke and the fumes of punch, 
or reeking with kitchen and stable odours — which 
Fielding makes us inhale For Fielding, in his 
novels, followed the growing tendency of fiction, 
already apparent in Defoe, to pictuie even the lowest 
phases of humanity as truthfully as possible. In 
doing so he but set the example for all his great 
successors Not all, indet-d, have a picaresque ele- 
ment in their work, but all have made at least some 
slight attempt to introdnee humble realism. It is 
because Defoe was the great pioneer in this that he 
is important in our literary history. And because 
Kobimwi Crusoe was the first of his long pieces of 
fiction — because, thanks to the success of this, Defoe 
'vvas encouraged to give to the world others more 
in the line of develupinent of the English novel — 
for these reasons, apart from its intrinsic interest, 
Robinson Crusoe holds an important place in the 
history of our literature.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 


I F ever the story of any private man's adven- 
tures in the world were worth making public, 
and were acceptable when published, the Edi- 
tor of this account thinks this will be so. 

The wonders of this man's life exceed all that (he 
thinks) IS to be found extant ; the life of one man 
being scarce capable of a greater vanety. 

The .stoiy is told with modesty, with seriousness, 
and with a religious application of events to the 
uses to which wise men always apply them, viz., to 
the instruction of others by this example, and to 
justify and honour the wisdom of Providence in all 
the vanety of our circumstances, let them happen 
how they will. 

The Editor believes the thing to be a just history 
of fact ; neither is there any appearance of fiction in 
it , and, however, thinks, because all such things are 
despatched,^ that the improvement of it, as well to 
the diversion as to the instruction of the reader, will 
be tbe same. And as such, he thinks, without 
farther compliment to the world, he does them a 
great service in the publication. 

* This word has been altered in some of the reprints to “ dis- 
puted ” The sentence is awkward, but the meaning appears to 
be that tbe wnter is of opinion that stones are thrown aside so 
quickly, that the effect produced by them (the improvement) is 
the same, whether they are true histories or romances.

THE LIFE and ADVENTURES 

/ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of 
York, of a good family/ though not of 
that country, my father being a foreigner 
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull, He 
got a good estate by merchandise, and leav- 
ing off his trade, lived afterward at York, from 
whence he had married my mother, whose relations 
were named Robinson, a very good family in that 
country, and fuini whom 1 was called Robinson 
Kreutznaer, but by the usual corruption of words 
in England we are now called, nay, we call our- 
selves, and write our name, Cinisoe, and so my 
companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu- 
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot 
ill Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous 
Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle 
near Dunkirk against the Spaniards, what became 
of iny second brother I never knew, any more 
than my father and mother did know what was 
become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to 
any ti’^e, my head began to be filled very early with 
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, 
had given me a competent .share of learning, as far 
as house-education and a country fine school gener- 
ally goes, and designed me for the law ; but I would 
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my 
VOU I. — 1 [ 1 3 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


inclination to this led me so strongly against the 
will, nay, the commands, of my father, and against 
all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and 
other friends, that there seemed to be something 
fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to 
the life of misery which was to befall me 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was 
my design. He called me one morning into his 
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and 
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. 
He asked me what reasons more than a mere wan- 
dering inclination I had for leaving my father’s house 
and my native country, where I might lie well intro- 
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortunes 
by application and industry, with a life of ease and 
pleasure He told me it was foi men of desperate 
fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior for- 
tunes on the other, who went abroad upon atlven- 
tqres, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves 
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the 
common road ; that these things were all eitlier too 
far above me, or too far below me ; that mine w'as 
the middle state, or what might lie called the upper 
station of low life, whidi he had found by long ex- 
perience was the best state in the w orld, the most 
suited to human happiness, not exposed to the 
miseries and haixlships, the labour and suffenngs, 
of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar- 
rassed with the pride, luxuiy, ambition, and envy 
of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might 
judge of the happiness of this state by this one 
thing, viz , that this was the state of life w Inch all 
other people envied, that kings have fiwjuently 
lamented the miserable consequences of being born 
to great things, and wished they had been placed 
m the middle of the two extremes, between the mean 
[ 2 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and the gi^at ; that the wise man gave his testimony 
to this us the just standard of true felicity, when he 
prayed to have neither poverty or riches. 

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, 
that the calamities of life were shared among the 
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the 
middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not 
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or 
lower part of mankind. Nay, they were not sub- 
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses either 
of body or mind as those were who, by vicious liv- 
ing, luxury, and extravagancies on one hand, or by 
hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insuf- 
ficient diet on the other hand, bring distempers 
upon themselves by the natural consequences of 
their way of living; that the middle station of life 
was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind 
of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the 
handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, 
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable 
diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the bless- 
ings attending the middle station of life , that this 
way men went silently and smoothly through the 
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed 
with the labours of the hands or of the head, not 
sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed 
with jierplexed circumstanc-es, which rob the soul 
of peace, and the laxly of cast; not enraged with 
the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of 
ambition for great things ; but in ea.sy circumstances 
.sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tast- 
ing the .sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling 
that they are happy, and learning by every day’s 
experience to know it more sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the 
most afif'ectionate manner, not to play the young 
man, not to precipitate myself into miseries whi(£ 
[ 3 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Nature and the station of life I was bom in seemed 
to have provided against , that I w'as under no neces- 
sity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well for 
me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station 
of life w’hich he had lieen just recommending to me ; 
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the 
world it must be my mere fate or fault that must 
hinder it, and that he should have nothing to answer 
for, having thus discliarged Ins duty in warning me 
against measures which he knew would be to my 
hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind 
things tor me if I would stay and settle at home as 
he directed, so he would not have so much hand in 
my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to 
go away. And to close all, ho told me I had my 
elder brother for an example, to whom he hail used 
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from 
going into the l.ow f’ounlrv wars, but could not 
prevail, Ins young desires prompting him to run 
into the aiiiiy, wlieie ho was killed , and though he 
.said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would 
venture to sny to me, that if I did take this foolish 
step, God would not bless me, and I would have 
leisure hereaftei to reflect upon having neglected 
his counsel when theie might be none to assist in 
my recovery. 

I observed in this ].,st part of his di.scourse, which 
was truly piophetie, though I suppose my father did 
not know it to be so hinisolf — I sav, I obseived the 
tears run down his faw verv jilentifully, and espe- 
cially when lie spoke of iiiy brother w'ho was killed ; 
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to 
repent, and none to assist me, he w as so moved, that 
he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart 
was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as 
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not 
[ 4 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to think of going abroad any more, hut to settle at 
home according to my father’s desire. But alas ! a 
few days wore it all off ; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father’s farther importunities, in a few 
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first 
heat of resolution prompted, but I took my mother, 
at a time w'hen I tliought her a little pleasanter than 
ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were so 
entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should 
never settle to anything with resolution enough to 
go through with it, and m> father had better give 
me his consent than force me to go without it , that 
I was now eighteen >ears old, which was too late to 
go apprentice to a tr.ide, or clerk to an attorney , 
that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out 
my time, and I should cc'itainly run away from my 
master before my time was out, and go to sea, and 
if she would speak to my father to let me go but one 
voyage abioacl, if I came home again and did not 
like It, I would go no more, and I w ould promise by 
a double diligence to I'ecover that time I had lost. 

^'his put iny mother into a great passion. She 
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to 
speak to iny father upon any such subject , that he 
knew too well what wa.s iny interest to give his con- 
sent to anything so much for mv hurt, and that she 
wondered how I could think of any such thing after 
such a discourse as I had had with my father, and 
such kind and tender expressions as she knew my 
father had used to me ; and that, in short, if I would 
rum myself there was uo help for me, but I might 
depend I should never have their consent to it , that 
for hei part, she would not have so much hand in my 
destruction, and I should never have it to say, that 
my mother was willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


father, yet, &>> I have heard afterwards, she reported 
all the discourse to him, and that my father, after 
showing a great concern at it, said to her with a 
sigh, “ That boy might be happy if lie would stay at 
home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest 
wretch that was e\er born I can give no consent to 


It was not till almost a year after this that I broke 
loose, though in the meantime I continued obstinately 
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre- 
quently expostulating with niy father and mother 
about their being so positively determined against 
what the} know my inclinations prompted me to 
But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, 
and without any puipose of making an elopement 
that time , but I say, being there, and one of niy 
companions being going by sea to London, in his 
father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them, 
with the common allureincnt of seafaring men, viz., 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I 
consulted neither fathei oi mother any more, nor so 
much as sent them word of it , but leaving them to 
hear of it as they might, without asking God’s bless- 
ing, or my father’s, without any consideration of cir- 
cumstances or consequents, and in an ill hour, God 
knows, on the first of September, 1651, I went on 
board a ship bound tor London. Never any young 
adventurer’s inisfortunc.s, I lieheve, began sooner, oi 
continued longer than mine. The ship was no .sooner 

S itten out of the Humber, but the wind began to 
ow, and the waves to nse in a most frightful man- 
ner; and as I had never been at sea before, I was 


most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in my 
mind. I negan now senousU' to reflect upon what 
I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the 
judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father’s 
house, and abandoning my duty , all tlie good counsel 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s 
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind, and my 
conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of 
hardness which it has been since, reproached me with 
the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty 
to Grod and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, 
which I had never been upon before, went very high, 
though nothing like what I have seen many times 
since; no, nor like what I saw a few days after. 
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a 
young sailor, and had never known anything of the 
matter I expected every wave would have swal- 
lowed Us up, and that every time the ship fell down, 
as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we 
should never rise more, and in this agony of mind I 
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would 
please God here to spare my life this one voya^ if 
ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I 
would go directly home to my father, and never set 
it into a ship again while I lived, that I would take 
bis advice, and ncvci run iii>.self into .such miseries 
a-s these any more. Now I saw' plainly the goodness 
of his observations alxiut the middle station of life, 
how easy, how conifortablv he had lived all his days, 
and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or 
troubles on shore , and I resolved that I w'ould, like 
a true lepeiiting prodigal, go home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the 
while the storm continued, and indeed some time 
after, but the next day the wind was abated and 
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to 
it. However, I was very grave for all that day, be- 
ing also a little sea-sick still , but towards night the 
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a 
charming fine evening followed , the sun went down 
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


tiaving little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun 
shining upon it, the sight was, as 1 thought, the 
most delightful that e\er I saw. 

I liad slept well in the night, and was now no 
more sea-sick but very cheerful, looking w'ith wonder 
upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day 
liefore, and could Ive so calm and so pleasant in so 
little time after And now lest my good resolutions 
should continue, my companion, who had indeed en- 
ticed me away, conies to me . “ Well, Bob,” says he, 
clapping me on the slioulder, “ how do you do after 
it? I warrant you frighted, wa’u’t you, last 
night, wlien it blew but a capful of wind ” “A 
capful, d’you call it?” said I, “’twas a terrible 
storm.” A storm, you fool you,” replies he , “ do 
you call that a storm ? Why, it was nothing at all ; 
give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think 
nothing of such a squall of wind as that , but you’re 
but a fresh-watci sailoi. Bob. Come, let us make a 
bowl of punch, and w e ’ll forget all that , d’ ye see 
what charming weather ’t is now ? ” I'o make short 
this sad part of my stoiy, we went the old way of all 
sailors , the punch was mode, and I was made diunk 
with it, and in that one night's wickedness I drow ned 
all my repentance, all my reflections upon iny past 
conduct, and all iiiy resolutions for my future. In 
a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness 
of surface and .settled calmness by the abatement of 
that storm, so tlie huiry of iiiv thoughts being over, 
ray fears an<l appieheiisions of lieiiig swallowed up 
by the sea being forgotten, and the curieiit of my 
former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows 
and promises that I made iii my distress I found 
indera some intervals of reflection, and the .serious 
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again 
sometimes ; but I shook them off, and loused myself 
from them as it were from a distemper, and apply- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ing rnyseU to drink and compan^r, soon mastei’ed the 
return of those fits, for so I called them, and I had 
in five or six days got as complete a victory over 
conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to 
be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have 
another trial for it still ; and Providence, as in such 
cases generally it does. Resolved to leave me entirely 
without excuse. For if I w’ould not take this for a 
deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the 
worst and most hardened wretch among us would 
confess both the danger and the ineiTy. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into 
Yarmouth roads, tlie wind having been contrary 
and the weathei calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm Here we weic obliged to come to 
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing 
contrary, v i/., at south-west, for seven or eight days, 
during whuh time a gieat many ships fmni New- 
castle came into the same roads, as the common har- 
bour where the ships might wait for a wind for the 
nver. 

We had not, however, lid here so long, but should 
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew 
too fresh, and after we had lain four or five days, 
blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned 
as gootl as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our 
ground-tackle veiy strong, our men were uncon- 
eerned, and not in the lea.st apprehensive of danger, 
but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the man- 
ner of the sea ; but the eighth day in the morning 
the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to 
strike oiir topmasts, and make everytliing snug and 
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. 
By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship 
rid forecastle in, .shipped several seas, and we thought 
once or twice oui anchor had come home; upon 
which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so 

[ 9 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables 
veered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a ternble storm indeed, and 
now I began to see teiror and amazement in the faces 
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though 
vigilant to the business of preserving the ship, yet 
as he went in and nut of his cabin by me, I could 
hear him softly to him.sclf sav several times, “Lord 
be meiciful to us, we shall he all lost, we shall be all 
undone,” and the like. Dining these first hurries 
I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in 
the steerage, and cannot describe iny temper, I 
could ill reassmne the first penitence, which I had 
so apparently trampled upon, and hanlened myself 
against ; I thought the bitterness of death had been 
past, and that this would be nothing too, like the 
first. But when the master himself came by me, as 
I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was 
dreadfully frighted , I got up out of m\ cabin, and 
looked out. But such a dismal sight I never saw ; 
the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us 
every three or four minutes , when I could look 
about, I could see nothing but distress round us 
Two ships that rid near us we found had cut then 
masts by the board, being deep louden ; and our men 
cried out, that a ship which iid about a mile ahead 
of us was foundei-ed. Two more ships being driven 
from their anchors, were run out of the reads to sea 
at all adventures, and that with nut a mast standing. 
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la- 
bouring in the sea , but two or three of them drove, 
and came close by us, running away with only their 
sprit-sail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged 
the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore- 
mast, which he was very unwilling to. But the 
boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the 
[ 10 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ship would founder, he consented ; and when they 
had cut away the foremast, the nminmast stood so 
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged 
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in 
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had 
been in sueh a fright before at but a little. But if I 
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about 
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind 
upon account of my former convictions, and the hav- 
ing returned fixini them to the resolutions I had 
wickedly taken at h'rst, than I was at death itself, 
and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me 
into such a condition, that I can by no words de- 
scribe it. But the worst was not come jet ; the 
stonn continued with such fury, that the seamen 
themselves acknowledge*! they had never known a 
w'orse. We liatl a good ship, but she was deep 
loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen 
every now and then cned out she would founder. 
It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not 
know what they meant by founder till I inquired. 
However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what 
is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some 
others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, 
and expecting every moment when the ship would 
go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and 
under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men 
that hail been down on purpose to see cnc4 out we 
had sprung a leak ; another said there was four foot 
water in the hold. Then all hands w'cre called to 
the pump. At that veiy word my heart, as I 
thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon 
the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. How- 
ever, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that 
was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another , at which I stirred up and went 
[ 11 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to the pump and worked very heartily. While this 
was doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, 
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip 
and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered 
to tire a gun as a signal of distiess. I, w'ho knew 
nothing what that meant, was so surpnsed that I 
thought the ship had broke, or some dreailful thing 
had happened. In a word, I was so surprised that 
I fell down in a swoon As tins was a tune when 
everybody' had his own life to think of, nobody 
minded me, or what w’as become of me ; but another 
man stepped up to the pump, and thiustiiig me 
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been 
dead , and it was a great while before I tame to 
myself. 

We w'orked on, but the water iiici’easing in the 
hold, it was apparent that the slnp woultl founder, 
and though the stoiiii began to iibiiti* a little, yet .is 
it was not possible she could swim till we might 
rtin into a poit, so the master continued filing guns 
for help ; and a light ship, who had rid it out just 
ahead of us, \eiitured a boat out to help us It was 
with the utmost hazard the boat came neai us, but 
it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the 
boat to lie near the ship’s side, till at last the men 
rowing very heartily, and veiituiing their lives to 
save ours, our men cast them a rope ovei the stern 
with a buoy to it, and then \eeied it out a great 
length, which they aftci great laboui and hazaid 
took hold of, and we hanl^ them clo.se under our 
stem, and got all into their boat It was to no 
puipose for them or us after we weie in the boat to 
think of reaching to their own ship, so all agreed 
to let her drive, and only to pull hei in towards 
shore as much as we could, and our master promised 
them that if the boat was staved upon shore he 
would make it good to their master , so partly row- 
[ 12 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ing and partly driving, oar boat went away to the 
norward, sloping towards the shoi-e almost as far as 
Winterton Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour 
out of our ship but we saw her sink, and then I 
understood for the first time what was meant by a 
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I 
had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me 
she was sinking , for from that moment they rather 
put me into the boat than that I might be said to 
go 111 ; my heart was as it were dead within me, 
partly with flight, partly with horror of mind and 
the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we weie m this condition, the men yet 
labouring at the oar to bnng the boat near the 
shore, we could sec, when, our boat mounting the 
waies, we were able to see the shore, a great many 
people running along the shore to assist us when we 
should come near But we made but slow way 
towaixls the shore, nor weie we able to reach the 
shore, till being past the lighthouse at Winterton, 
the shore falls oft' to the westward towards Cromer, 
and so the land biokc oft' a little the violence of the 
wind Here we got in, and though not without 
much difficulty got all safe on shore, and walked 
afteiwaids on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfor- 
tunate men, wo weix; used with great humanity as 
well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned 
us good quarters, as by particular inei’chants and 
owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient 
to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as 
we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone hack to 
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and 
iny father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable, 
had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for hearing 
the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth

road, it a gi’eat while before he had any assur- 
ance that I WHS not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti- 
nacy that nothing could resist , and though I had 
several times loud calls from my reason and my more 
composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power 
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I 
urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries 
us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, 
even though it be before us, and that we rush upon 
it with our eyes open. Certainly nothing but some 
such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and 
which it was impossible for me to escape, could have 
pushed me forwavtl against the calm reasonings and 
persuasions of my most retiied thoughts, and against 
two such visible instructions as I had met with in 
my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, 
and who w'as the niastei’s son, was now less forward 
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were 
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, 
for we were sepaiated in the town to several quarters 
— I say, the ^il^t tune he saw me, it appeared his 
tone was alteixid, and looking very melancholy and 
shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling 
his father who I weus, and how I had come this 
voyage only for a trial in order to go farther abroad, 
his father turning to me with a \ery grave and con- 
cerned tone, “Young man,” says he, “you ought 
never to go to sea any more, you ought to take this 
for a plain and visible token, that you arc not to be 
a seafaring man ” “ Why, sir,” said I, “ will you go 

to sea no more ^ ” “ That is anothei case,” said he ; 

“ it is my calling, and therefore my duty ; but as you 
made this voyage for a trial, you see what a ta.ste 
Heaven has given you of what you are to cxjiect if 
you persist . perhaps this is all befallen us on your

account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray, 
continues he, “ what are you ? and on what account 
did you go to sea ? ” Upon that I told him some 
of my story, at the end of which he burst out with a 
strange kind of passion. “ What had I done,” says 
he, “ that such an unhappy wretch should come into 
my ship ^ I would not set tny foot in the same ship 
with thee again for a thousand pounds.” This in- 
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which 
were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was 
farther than he could have authority to go How- 
ever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, ex- 
horted me to go back to my father, and not tempt 
Providence to mv ruin ; told me I might see a 
visible hand of Heaven against me. “ And, young 
man,” said he, depend upon it, if you do not go 
back, wherever you go you will meet with nothing 
but disasters and disappointments, till your father’s 
words are fulfilled upon you.” 

We parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, 
and I saw him no more, which way he went, I know 
not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, 
I travelled to London by land , and there, as well as 
on the road, had many struggles with myself what 
course of life I should take, and whether I should go 
home, or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best 
motions that ottered to my thoughts , and it imme- 
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed at 
among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to 
see, not my father and mother only, but even every- 
body else , from whence I have since often observM 
how incongruous and irrational the common temper 
of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason 
which ought to guide them in such cases, viz , that 
they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to 
repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they 
[ 15 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed 
of the retuniing, which only can make them be 
esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some 
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what 
course of life to lead An iiTesistiblc reluctance 
continued to going home, and as I sta}cd awhile, 
the remembrance of the distiess I had been in wore 
off ; and as that abated, the little motion I had in 
my desires to a ix-tuin woi'e off with it, till at last 1 
quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out 
for a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away 
from my father’s house, that hurried me into the 
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, 
and that impies,sed those c*onceits so foicibl^ upon 
me as to make me deaf to all good advice, ami to 
the entreaties and even command of my father — 
I say, the same influence, w'hatevei it was, piesented 
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view' , 
and I went on boai-d a vessel bound to the coast of 
Africa, or, as our .sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage 
to Guinea 

It was my great inisfoitune that in all the.se ad- 
ventures I did not .ship nivself as a .sailor, wherebv, 
though I might inde'd have worked a little liaidei 
than oRliiiary, yet at the .same time I had learned 
the duty and office of a foremast ninii, and in time 
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, 
if not for a master. But as it was always my fate 
to choose for the woi>c, so I did heie, for having 
money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my 
back, I would always go on board in the habit of a 
gentleman ; and .so I neither had any business in the 
ship, or learned to do any 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good 
company in London, which does not always happen 
[ 16 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then 
was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay some 
snare for them very early , but it was not so with 
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a 
ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, 
having had very good success there, was resolved to 
go again , and who, taking a fancy to my convei-sa- 
tion, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, 
hearing me say I hatl a mind to see the world, told 
me if I would go the voyage with him I should be 
at no expense ; I should be his messmate and his 
companion , and if I could carry anything with me, 
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade 
would admit, and jierhaps I might meet with some 
eiicouragenieiit 

I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict 
fiiendshij) with this captain, who was an honest and 
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and 
earned a small adventure with me, which, by the dis- 
inteiested honesty of my friend the captain, I in- 
creased very eoiisidoiabl\, foi I cariied about ^40 
111 suih toys and trifles as the captain directed me 
to buy 'rills i’40 I had mustered together by tlie 
assistance of some of my relations whom I corre- 
sponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or 
at least my inothei, to contnbute so much as that 
to my first adventuie. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was 
successful in all m\ adveiitiiixis, and which I owe to 
the integrity and honestj of my friend the captain ; 
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of 
the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned 
how to keep an account of the ship’s course, take an 
obsei vntioii, and, in short, to undci stand somethings 
that were needful to Ije undei’stood by a sailor. For, 
as he took delight to intiuduce me, I took delight 
to leain , and, in a vvoid, this voyage mode me both

a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five 
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for iny adventure, 
which yielded me in London at my return almost 
£ 300 , and this filled me with those aspinng thoughts 
which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had m3 misfortunes too ; 
particularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown 
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the 
climate ; our principal trading being upon the coast, 
from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the 
line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my 
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his 
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and 
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his 
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the 
command of the ship. This was the unhappicst 
voyage that evei man made ; for though I did not 
cany quite ^100 of my new-gained wealth, so that 
1 had jPSOO left, and which I lodged with my fiiend’s 
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into 
terrible misfortunes 111 this voyage , and the first was 
this, viz, our ship making her course towards the 
Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and 
the African shore, was surpnsed in the grey of the 
morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave 
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We 
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would 
spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear, but 
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer- 
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we pre- 
pared to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the 
rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he 
came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just 
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart oiir stern, 
as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to 
bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


him, which made him sheer off again, after returning 
our fire and pouring in also his small-shot from near 
200 men which he had on board. However, we had 
not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He 
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend our- 
selves ; but laying us on board the next time upon 
our other c|uartcr, he entered sixty men upon our 
decks, who immediately fell to cutting and Hacking 
the decks and rigging. We plied them with small- 
shot, half-pikes powder-chests, and such like, and 
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut 
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship 
being disabled, and three of our men killed and 
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were 
earned all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging 
to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at 
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the country 
to the emperor’s court, as the rest of our men were, 
but was kept by the captain of the rover as his 
proper prize, and made his .slave, being young and 
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising 
change of iiiy circumstances from a merchant to a 
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and 
now I looked back upon iiiy father’s prophetic dis- 
course to me, that I should be mi.serable, and have 
none to relic\e me, which I thought was now so 
effectually bi ought to pass, that it could not be 
worse ; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken 
me, and I was undone without redemption. But 
alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to 
go through, as will appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or roaster, had taken me home 
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take 
me with him when he went to sea again, believing 
that it would some time or other be his fate to be 
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and 
[19] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that then I should he set at liberty. But this hope 
of mine was soon taken away ; for when he went to 
sea, he left me on shore to look alter his little gar- 
den, and do the common drudgery of slaves about 
his house; and when became home again fiom his 
cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after 
the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what 
method I might take to effect it, but found no way 
that had the least probability in it. Nothing pre- 
sented to make the supposition of it rational , for I 
had nobody to communicate it to that would em- 
bark with me, no fellow -slave, no Englishman, Irish- 
man, or Scotsman there but myself; so that for two 
years, though I often pleased myself with the imagi- 
nation, yet I never had the least encouraging pros- 
pect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years an odd circumstance pre- 
sented itself, which put the old thought of making 
some attempt for my liberty again in my head. My 
patron lying at home longci than usual without fit- 
ting out his ship, which, as 1 heaid, was for want 
of money, he u.sed constantly, once or twice n week, 
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take 
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fish- 
ing ; and as he always took me and a young Mareseo 
with him to row the boat, we made him very ineiry, 
and I proved very dexterous in catching fisb , inso- 
much, that sometimes be would send me with a 
Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth the Mareseo, 
as they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him. 

It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a 
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though 
we were not half a league from the shore we lost 
sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or 
which way, jve laboured all day, and all the next 
night, and when the morning came we found we had 
* [ 20 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; 
and that we were at least two leagues from the shore. 
However, we got well in again, ^ough with a great 
deal of labour, and some danger, for the wind began 
to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but particularly 
we were all very hungry. 

But OUT patron, warned by this dise^ter, resolved 
to take more care of himself for the future ; and hav- 
ing lying by him the long-boat of our English ship 
which he had taken, he resolved he would not go 
a-dshing any more without a compass and some pro- 
vision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who 
also was an English slave, to build a little state- 
room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like 
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to 
steer and haul home the main-sheet, and room before 
for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She 
sailed with what we call a shoiilder-of-mutton sail ; 
and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which 
lay very snug and low, and had m it room for him 
to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, 
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of 
such liquor as he thought fit to drink ; piarticularly 
his bread, nee, and coffee. 

We w'ent frequently out with this boat a-fishing, 
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, 
he never went without me. It happened that he had 
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure 
or for fisli, with two or three Moors of some distinc- 
tion in that place, and for whom he had provided 
extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board 
the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than 
ordinary; and had orders me to get ready three 
fuzees with powder suid shot, which were on board 
his ship, for that they designed some sport of fowl- 
ing as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and 

[«13 ’ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


waited the next morning with the boat, washed 
rlean, her ancient and pendants out, and everything 
to accommodate his f^ests; when by-and-by my 
patron came on board alone, and told me his guests 
had put off going, upon some business that fell out, 
and ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to 
go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for 
that his friends were to sup at his house ; and com- 
manded that as soon as I had got some fish I should 
bring it home to his house; all which I prepared 
to do. 

This moment my foimer notions of deliverance 
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like 
to have a little ship at my command ; and my mas- 
ter being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for 
a fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew 
not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I 
should steer , for anywhere, to get out of that place. 


. was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to 
speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist- 
ence on board ; for I told him we must not presume 
to eat of our patron’s bread. He said that was true ; 
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of 
their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the 
boat. I knew where my patron’s case of bottles 
stood, which it was evident by the make were 
taken out of some English pri7.e; and 1 conveyed 
them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as 
if they had been there before for our master. I con- 
veyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, 
which weighed above half a hundiedweight, with a 
parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a 
hammer, all which were great use to us afterwards, 
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick 
I tried upon him, which he innocently came into 
also. His name was Ismael, who they ^1 Muly, or 
•. [S2] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Moely ; so I called to him, “ Moely,” said I, “ our 
patron's guns are on board the boat ; can you not 
get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill 
some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, 
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship." 
“ Ye says he, “ I '11 bring some ; " and accordingly 
he brought a great leather pouch which held abwt 
a pound and a half of powder, or rather more ; and 
another with shot, that had live or six pounds, with 
some bullets, and put all into the boat. At the 
same time I had found some powder of my master's 
in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the 
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, 
pouring what was in it into another ; and thus fur- 
nished with everything needful, we sailed out of the 
port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of 
the port, knew who we were, and took no notice 
of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port 
before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. 
The wind blew from the NNE., uhich was contrary 
to my desire ; for had it blown southerly 1 had been 
sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least 
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions 
were, blow which way it would, I would be gone 
from the horrid place where I was, and leave the 
rest to Fate. 

After w'e had fished some time and catched noth- 
ing, for when I had fish on my hook I would not 
pull them up, that he might not see them, I said to 
the Moor, “This will not do; our master will not 
be thus served; we must stand farther off.” He, 
thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the head of 
the boat set the sails ; and as I had the helm I run 
the boat out near a league fiirther, and then brought 
her to as if I would fi^ ; when giving the boy the 
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and 
making as if I stooped for something behind him, I 

[as] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


took him by surprise with my arm under his twist, 
and tossed him dear overboard into the sea. He 
rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and 
called to me, oegged to be taken in, told me 
he would go all the world over with me. He 
swam HO strong after the boat, that he would have 
reached me very quick^, there being but little wind ; 
upon which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching 
one of the fowhng-pieccs, I presented it at him, and 
told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would 
be quiet I would do him none. “ But,” said I, 
“ you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and 
the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, 
and 1 will do vou no harm ; but if you come near 
the boat I ’ll sboot you through the head, for I am 
resolved to have my liberty.” So he turned himself 
about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt 
but he reached it with ea.se, for he was an excellent 
swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this 
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but there 
was no venturing to trust him When he was gone 
I turned to the boy, whom they colled Xury, and 
said to him, “Xury, if you will be faithful to me 
I ’ll make you a great man ; but if you will not 
stroke your face to be true to me,” tliat is, swear by 
Mahomet and his father’s beard, “ I must throw you 
into the sea too.” The boy smiled in my face, and 
spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him, 
and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the 
world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim- 


ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, 
rather stretching to wiijdward, that they might 
think me gone towards the straits’ mouth (as indeed 
any one that had been in their wits must have been 
supposed to do) ; for who would have supposed we 
[24J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


were sailed on to the southward to the truly barba- 
rian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure 
to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us ; 
where we could ne'er once go on shore but we should 
be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless sav- 
ages of human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I 
changed my course, and steered directly south and 
by east, bending niy course a little toward the east, 
that I might keep in with the shore; and having a 
fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I 
made such sail that I believe by the next day at 
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made 
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of 
Sallee , quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's do- 
minions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, 
for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, 
and the dreadful (^prehensions 1 had of falling into 
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, 
or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till 
I had sailed in that manner five days , and then the 
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that 
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also 
would now give oier, so I ventured to make to the 
coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little 
nvcr, 1 knew not what, or where, neither what 
latitude, what country, what nations, or what river. 
I neither saw, or desired to see, any people; the 
principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came 
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on 
shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the coun- 
try ; but as soon as it was quite dark we heard such 
dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling 
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that 
the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged 
of me not to go on shore till day. “ Well, Xuiy," 

[ 25 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


wid I, “then I won’t; but it may be we maj see 
men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions." 
“Then we give them the shoot gun," says Xury, 
laughing ; “ make them run way." Such English 
Xury spoke W conversing among us slaves. How- 
ever, I was giad to see the boy so cheerful, and I 
gave him a dram (out of our patron’s case of bottles) 
to cheer him up. After all, Xury’s advice was good, 
and I took it ; we dropped our little anchor and lay 
still ail night. I say still, for we slept none ; for in two 
or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew 
not what to call them) of many sorts come down to 
the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing and 
washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling them- 
selves ; and they made suw hideous howhngs and 
veilings, that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was 
I too, but we were both more frighted when we 
heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming 
towards our boat ; we could not see him, but we 
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous 
huge and funous beast. Xury said it was a lion, 
and it might be so for aught 1 know; but poor 
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row 
away. “ No," says I, “ Xury , we can slip our cable 
with the buoy to it, and go off to sea ; they cannot 
follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I per- 
ceived the creature (whatever it was) within two 
oars’ length, which something surprised me ; how- 
ever, I immediately stepped to the cabin door, and 
taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he im- 
mediately turned about and swam towards the shore 
again. 

But it is impossible to describe tlie homble noises, 
and hideous cries and bowlings, that were raised, as 
well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the 
country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing I 
[ 26 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


have some reason to believe those creatures had never 
heard before. This convinced me that there was no 
going on shore for us in the night upon that coast ; 
and how to venture on shore in the nay was another 
question too ; for to have fallen into the hands of 
any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen 
into the hands of lions and tigers ; at least we were 
equq^lly apprehensive of the danmr of it. 

Be that as it would, we were ooliged to go on shore 
somewhere or other for water, for we hatl not a pint 
left in the boat ; when or where to get to it, was the 
point. Xury said if I would let him go on shore 
with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 
water and bring some to me. I asked him why he 
would go ^ why I should not go and he stay in the 
boat ? The boy answered with so much affection, 
that made me love him ever after. Says he, “ If 
wild mans come, they eat me, you go way." “ Well, 
Xury,” said I, “ we will both go , and if the wild 
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither 
of us.” So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, 
and a dram out of our patron’.s case of bottles which 
I mentioned before; and we hauled in the boat as 
near the shore as we thought was proper, and so 
waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms and 
two jare for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fear- 
ing the coming of canoes with savages down the 
river ; but the boy seeing a low place about a mile 
up the country, rambled to it ; and by-and-by I saw 
him come running towards me. 1 thought he was 
pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild 
beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him ; 
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something 
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature 
that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, 
and longer legs. However, we were very glad of it, 

t j 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that 
poor Xury came with was to tell me be had found 
good water, and seen no wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take 
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek 
where we were we found the water fresh when the 
tide was out, which flowed but a little w&y up ; so 
we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had 
killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen 
no footsteps of any human creature in that part of 
the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I 
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and 
the Cape de Verde Islands alsri, lay not far off from 
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an 
observation to know what latitude we were in, and 
did not exactly know, oi at least remember, what 
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for 
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them ; 
otherwise I might now easily have found some of 
these islands. But my hope was, that if 1 stood 
along this coast till I came to that part where the 
Engnsh traded, I should find some of their vessels 
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve 
and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I 
now was mast be that country which, lying between 
the Emperor of Monicco’s dominions and the negroes, 
lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts , 
the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther 
south for fear of the Moors, and the Moors not think- 
ing it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness , 
and indeed both forsaking it because of the pio- 
digious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other 
furious creatures which harbour there , so that the 
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go 
like an army, two or three thousand men at a time : 

[28] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and indeed for near an hundred miles together upon 
this coast we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited 
country by day, and heard nothing but bowlings and 
roarings of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the 
Pico of Tenenffe, being the high ttm of the Mountain 
Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great mind to 
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; but having 
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, 
the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so I 
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along 
the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water 
after we had left this place ; and once in particular, 
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor 
under a little point of land which was pretty high ; 
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go 
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him 
than it seems mine were, rails softly to me, and tells 
me that we had best go farther oft' the .shore; “For,” 
says he, “ look, yonder lies a dqeadful monster on the 
side of that hillock fast asleep,” I looked w’here he 
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it 
was a teirible great lion that lay on the side of the 
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that 
hung as it were a little over him. “Xury,” says I, 
“ you shall go on shore and kill him.” Xuiy looked 
frighted, and said, “Me kill! he eat me at one 
mouth;” one mouthful he meant. However, I said 
no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I 
took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, 
and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and 
with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded 
another gun with two bullets ; and the third (for we 
had three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. 
I took the best aim I could with the first piece to 
have shot him into the head, but he lay so with his 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit 
his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He 
started up growling at first, but finding his leg broke, 
fell down again, and then gut up upon three Tegs and 
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was 
a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head. 
However, I took up the second piece immediately, 
and, though he began to move off, fired again, and 
shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to see 
him drop, and make but little noise, but lay strug- 
gling for life. Then Xuiy took heart, and would 
have me let him go on shore. “ Well, go.” said I , so 
the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little 
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, 
and coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of 
the piece to his oar, and shot him into the head 
again, which despatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food , 
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder 
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing 
to us. However, Xury said he would have some 
of him ; so he comes on hoai’d, and asked me to 
give him the hatchet. “For what, Xury .f*” said I. 
'* Me cut off his head,” said he. However, Aury could 
not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought 
it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. 

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin 
of him mi^t one way or other be of some value to 
us ; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So 
Xury and I went to work with him ; but Xury was 
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill 
how to do it. Indeed, it took us up both the whole 
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and 
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effect- 
ually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwaids 
served me to lie upon 

After this stop we made on to the southward con-

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing 
on our provisions, which began to abate very much, 
and going no oftener into the shore than we were 
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was 
to make the river Gambia or Senegal — that is to 
say, anywhere about the Cape de Verde — where I 
was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and 
if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, 
but to seek out for the islands, or perish there among 
the negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, 
which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Bra- 
zil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those 
islands ; and in a word, I put the whole of my for- 
tune upon this single point, either that I must meet 
with some ship, or must perish. 

When I iiaci pursued this resolution about ten days 
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land 
was inhabited: and in two or thitie places, as we 
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to 
look at us, we could also perceive they were quite 
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have 
gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better 
counsellor, and said to me, “ No go, no go.” How- 
ever, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk 
to them, and I found they ran along the ^ore by 
me a good way. I observed they had no weapions in 
their hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, 
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would 
throw them a great way with good aim. So I kept 
at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well 
as I could, and particularly made signs for something 
to eat ; they b^'koned to me to stop my boat, and 
that they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I 
lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of 
them ran up into the country, and in less than half 
an hour came back, and brought with them two 
pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the 
[ 31 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

produce of their country ; but we neither knew what 
the one or the other was. However, we were willing 
to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dis- 
pute, for I was not for venturing on shoi'e to them, 
and they were as much afraid of us ; but they took a 
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore 
and laid it down, and went and stood a gieat way oil* 
till we fetched it on board, and then mine close to us 
again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had 
nothing to make them amends. But an opportunity 
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully • 
for while we were lying by the shore came two 
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took 
it) with gieat fury from the mountains towards the 
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, 
or whethei they weie in .s|)ort or in rage, w'e could 
not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was 
u.sual or strange, but I believe it was the latter; 
because, in the fiiwt place, those lavenous creatures 
seldom appear but in the night ; and in the second 
place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially 
the w’oinen The man that had the lance or dart 
did not fly from them, but the re.st did , however, as 
the two creatures ran directly into the water, they 
did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes, 
but plunged tlieniselves into the sea, and swam about, 
as if they htui come for their diversion. At last, one 
of them began to come nearer our boat than at first 
I expected , but I lay leady for him, for I had loaded 
my gun with idl possible expedition, and bade Xury 
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly 
within my leach, I fired, and shot him directly 
into the head , immediately he sunk down into the 
water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, 
as if he was stmggling for life, and so indeed he 
was. He immediately made to the shore; but between 
[ 32 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the wound, which w6Uj hiR mortal hurt, and the strang- 
ling of the water, he died just before he reached the 
shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of 
these poor creatures, at the noise and the fire of my 
gun ; some of them were even ready to die for fear, 
and fell down as dead with tlic very terror. But 
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the 
water, and that I made signs to them to come to 
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, 
and began to scareh for the creature. I found him 
by his blood staining the water and by the help of 
a rope, which I .slung roimd him, and gave the 
negroes to haul, they dragged him on the snore, and 
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, 
and fine to an arimirable degree; and the negroes 
held up their hands with admiration, to think what 
it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire 
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up 
directly to the mountains from whence the}' came ; 
nor could I, at that di.stance, know what it was. I 
found quickly the negroes weie for eating the flesh 
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take 
it as a favour from me ; which, when I made signs to 
them that they might take him, they were very 
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with 
him , and though they had no knife, yet, with a 
sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as 
readily, and much more readily, than we could have 
done with a knife. They oflered me some of the 
flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give it 
them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave 
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of 
their provision, which, though I did not understand, 
yet I accepted Then I made signs to them for 
some water, and held out one of niy jars to them, 
VOL I — 3 [ 33 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


turning it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, 
and that I wanted to have it filled. They callm 
immediately to some of their friends, and there came 
two women, and brought a great vessel made of 
earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun ; this they 
set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore 
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women 
were as stark naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as 
it was, and water ; and leaving my friendly negroes, 
I made forward for about eleven days more, without 
offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run 
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance 
of four or five leagues before me ; and the sea being 
very calm, I kept a large offing, to make this point. 
At length, douliling the piint, at about tw’o leagues 
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, 
to seaward , then I concluded, as it was most certain 
indeed, that this was the Cape dc Verde, and those 
ther islands, called from thence Cape de Venle Islands. 
However, they were at a great distance, and I could 
not well tell what I had b«wt to do ; for if I should 
be taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach 
one or other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped 
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the 
helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cned out, “ Master 
master, a ship with a sail ' " and the foolish boy was 
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be 
some of his master's .ships sent to pursue us, when I 
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. 
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not 
only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a 
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the 
coast of Guinea, for negroes But when I observed 
the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were 
bound some other way, and did not design to come 
[ 34 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


any nearer to the shore ; upon which 1 stretched out 
to sea as much as I coul^ resolving to speak with 
them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should 
not be able to come in their way, but that they would 
be gone by before I could make any signal to them ; 
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and b^an to 
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their 
perspective glasses, and that it was some European 
uoat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some 
ship that was lost, so they shortened sail to let me 
come lip. I was encouraged with this , and as I had 
my patron’s ancient on board, I made a waft of it to 
them for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both 
which they saw ; for they told me they saw the 
smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon 
these signals they "very kindly brought to, and lay 
by for me , and in about thi'ee hours' tune I came 
up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in 
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none of 
them , but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board, 
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I 
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out 
of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee. Then they 
bade me come on boaid, and very kindly took me in, 
and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one 
will believe, that I was thu.s delivered, as I esteemed 
it, from such a miserable, and almost hopeless, con* 
dition as I was in ; and I immediately offered all I 
had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my 
deliverance. But he generously told me he would 
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be 
delivei-ed safe to me when I came to the Brazils. 
“ For,” says he, “ I have saved your life on no other 
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself ; and 
[ 85 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up 
in the same condition. Besides,” says he, “ when I 
carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your 
own country, if I should take from you what you 
have, you will be starved there, and then I only take 
away that life I have given. No, no. Seignior 
Inglese,” says he, “ Mr. Englishman, I will carry you 
thither in charity, and th(»ie things will help you to 
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home 
again.” 

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was 
just in the performance to a tittle ; for he ordered 
the seamen that none should olFer to touch anything 
I had ; then he took everything into his own pos- 
session, and gave me back an exact inventory of 
them, that I might have them, even so much as my 
three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that 
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the 
ship’s use, and asked me what I would have for it ? 
I told him he had been so generous to me in every- 
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of 
the boat, but left it entirely to him ; upon which he 
told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay 
me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when 
it came there, if any one offered to give more, he 
would make it up. lie ofi^red me also sixty pieces 
of eight more for my boy Xury, which 1 was 
loth to take ; not that I was not willing to let the 
captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor 
boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in 
procuring my own. However, when I let him know 
my reason, he owned it to be ju.st, and offered me 
this medium, that he would give the boy an obliga- 
tion to set him free in ten yeaiN if he turned Chns- 
tian. Upon this, and Xuiy saying he was willing 
to go to him, I let the captain have him. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and 
arrived in the tiiay de Todos los Santos, or All 
Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And 
now I was once more delivered from tne most miser- 
able of all conditions of life ; and what to do next 
with myself, I was now to consider. 

The generous tre.atment the captain gave me, I can 
never enough remember. He would take nothing of 
me for my pas-sage, gave me twenty ducats for the 
leopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which I 
had in my boat, and caused everytliing I had in the 
.ship to be punctually delivered me ; and what I was 
willing to scU he bought, such as the case of bottles, 
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax 
— for I had made cancues of the rest , in a word, I 
made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and 
with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, but being recommended 
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who 
had an ingehio as they call it, that is, a plantetion 
and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and 
acquaint^ myself by that means with the manner of 
their planting and making of sugar ; and seeing how 
well the planters li\t*d, and how they grew ncli 
suddenly, I resohed, if I could get liceni'e to settle 
there, I would turn planter among them, resolving in 
the meantime to find out some way to get my money 
which I had left in London remitted to me. To this 
purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalisation, 
I purcliased as much land that was uncured as my 
money would I’each, and formed a plan for ray plan- 
tation and settlement, and such a one as might be 
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to 
receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but 
bom of English parents, whose name was Wells, and 
in much such circumstanc*es as 1 was. I call him mv 
[ 37 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


neighbour, because bis plantation lay next to mine, 
and we went on very sociably together. My stock 
was but low, as well as his ; and we rather planted for 
food than anything else, for about two years. How- 
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to 
come into order ; so that the third year w c planted 
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of 

g xiund ready for planting canes in the year to come. 

ut we both wanted help ; and now I found, more 
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my 
boy Xury. 

But alas ' for me to do wrong that never did right 
was no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go 
on. I was gotten into an employment quite remote 
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I 
jdelighted in, and for which I forsook my father's 
house, and broke through all his good advice ; nay, 
I was coming into the very middle station, or uppei 
degree of low life, which my father advised me to 
before, and' which, if I resolved to go on with, I 
mi^t as well have stayed at home, and never have 
fatigued myself in the world as I had done. And I 
used often to say to myself, I could have done this 
as well in England among my friends, as have gone 
5000 miles off' to do it among strangem and savages, 
in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to 
hear from any part of the world that had tlie least 
knowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition 
with the utmost regiet. I had nobody to converse 
with, but now and then this neighbour ; no work to 
be done, but by the labour of my hands , and 1 used 
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some 
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself. 
But how just has it been' and how should all men 
reflect, that when they comparo their present con- 
ditions with others that are worse. Heaven may 

[381 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced 
of their former felicity by their experience ; — I say, 
how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I 
reflected on in an island of mere desolation should 
lie my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it 
with the life which I then led, in which, had 1 con- 
tinued, I had in all probability been exceeding 
prosperous and rich 

I was in some degree settled in my measures for 
carrying on the plantation before my kind friend, the 
captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went 
back ; for the ship remained there in providing his 
loading, and prejiaring for his voyage, near three 
months , when, telling him what little stock I had 
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly 
and sincere advice • “ Seignior Inglese,” says he, for 
so he always called me, “ if you will give me lettei-s, 
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders 
to the person who has \our money in London to 
send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I 
shall dii'ect, and in such goods as are proper for this 
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God 
willing, at my return. But since human affairs are 
all subject to changes and disasters, I would have 

J rou give orders but for one hundred pounds ster- 
ing, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the 
hazard be run for the first; so that if it come safe, 
you may order the rest the same way ; and if it mis- 
carry, you may have the other half to have recom’se 
to for your supply.” 

This wa.s so wholesome advice, and looked so 
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the 
best course I could take ; so I accordingly prepared 
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had len; my 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, 
as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account 

[ 89 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of all my adventures ; my slavery, escajje, and how I 
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the human- 
ity of his behaviour^ and in what condition I was now 
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply. 
And when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he 
found means, by some of tbe English nierehants there, 
to send over not the oi-dcr only, but a full account 
of my story to a merchant at London, who repre- 
sented it cdectually to her , whereupon, she not only 
delivered the money, but out of her own pocket sent 
the Portugal captain a very handsome present for his 
humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vesting this hundred 
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had writ 
for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he 
brought them all safe to me to the Brazils ; among 
which, without my direction (for I was too young in 
my business to think of them), he had taken care to 
have all sorts of tools, inm-work, and utensils neces- 
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use 
to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune 
made, for I si as surprised with loy of it ; and my good 
stewaid, the captain, liad laid out the five pounds, 
which my friend had sent him for a present for him- 
self, to purchase and bring me over a sen ant under 
bond for six years’ service, and would not accept of 
any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I 
would have him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all , but my goods being all Eng- 
lish manufactures, such os cloth, stuffs, baize, and 
things particularly valuable and desirable in the 
country, I found means to sell them to a very great 
advantage ; so that I may say I had more than four 
times the value of my first cargo, and was now in- 
finitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the 
advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing I 
[ 40 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


did, I bought me a negro slave, and an European 
servant also , I mean another besides that which the 
captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the 
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with 
me. 1 went on the next year with great sucmss in 
my plantation. I raised hfty great rolls of tobacco 
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for 
necessaries among im neighbours ; and these fifty 
rolls, being each of above a hundredweight, w'ere 
well cured, and laid by against the return of the 
fleet from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business 
and in wealth, niy head began to be Aill of projects 
and undertakings beyond my I'each, such as are, in- 
deed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. 

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had 
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me 
for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, 
retired life, and of which he h^ so sensibly described 
the middle station of life to be full of. But other 
things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful 
agent of all my own miseries ; and particularly, to 
increase my fault and double the reflections upon my- 
self, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure 
to make. All these miscarriages were procured by 
my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclina- 
tion of wandering abroad, and pursuing that incli- 
nation in contradiction to the clearest views of doing 
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those pros- 
pects, and those meeisures of life, which Nature and 
Providence concuiTed to present me with, and to make 
my duty. 

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from 
my parents, so I could not be rontent now, but I must 
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and 
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a 
rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the 
[ 41 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


nature of the thins admitted ; and thus I cast myself 
down again into the deepest gulf of human misery 
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent 
with life and a state of health in the world. 

To come, then, by the just degrees to the particu- 
lars of this part of iny story. You may suppose, that 
haviri^ now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and 
beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my 

K itation, I had not only learned the language, but 
contracted acquaintance and friendship among 
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants 
at St. Salvador, which was our port, and that in my 
discourses among them I had frequently given them 
an account of my two voyages to tne coast of Guinea, 
the manner of trading with the negroes there, and 
how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for tnfles 
— such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits 
of glass, and the like — not only gold-dust, Guinea 
grains, elephants’ teeth, &c., but negroes, for the ser- 
vice of the Brazils, in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my dis- 
courses on these heads, but especially to that part 
which related to the buying negroes; which was a 
trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but, 
as far as it was, had been carried on by the ansiento, 
or permission, of the Kings of Spain and Portugal, 
and engrossed in the public, so that few negroes were 
brought, and those excessive dear. * 

It happened, being in company with some mer- 
chants and planters of my aciiuaintance, and talking 
of those things very earnestly, three of them came to 
me the next morning, and told me they had been mus- 
ing veiy much upon what I had discoursed with them 
of, the last night, and they came to make a secret 
proposal to me. And after enjoining me secrecy, 
they told me that they had a mind to lit out a ship 
to go to Guinea ; that they had all plantations as 
[ 42 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


well as 1, and were straitened for nothing so much as 
servants ; that as it was a trade that could not be car- 
ried on because they could not publicly sell the negroes 
when they came home, so they desired to make but 
one voya^, to bring the negroes on shore privately, 
and divide them among their own plantations ; and, 
in a word, the question was, whether I would go their 
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading paii; 
upon the coast of Guinea ; and they offered me that 
I should have my equal share of the negroes without 
providing any part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had 
it been made to aii^ one that had not had a settle- 
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which 
was in a fair way of coming to be very consider- 
able, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, 
that was thus entered and established, and had 
nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three or 
four years more, and to have sent for the other hun- 
dred pounds from England ; and who, in that time, 
and with that little addition, could scarce have failed 
of being w orth three or four thousand pounds steiling, 
and that increasing too — for me to think of such a 
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever 
man, in such circumstances, could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, 
could no more resist the offer than I could restrain 
my first rambling designs, when my father's good 
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them 
I would go with all my heart, if they would under- 
take to look after ray plantation in my absence, and 
would dispose of it to such as 1 should direct if 
I miscarrira. This they all engaged to do, and en- 
tered into writings or covenants to do so; and I 
made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and 
effects, in case of my death ; making the captain of 
the ship that had saVed my life, as before, my uni- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


versa] heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects 
as I had directed in my will , one-half of the produce 
being to himself, and the other to be shipped to 
England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve 
my effects, &nd keep up my plantation. Had I 
usM half as much prudence to have looked into my 
own interest, and nave made a judgment of what 
I ought to have done and not to have done, I 
had certainly nevei gone away from so prosperous 
an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a 
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage 'to 
sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say 
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular 
misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the 
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason. And 
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo 
furnished, and all things done as bj agreement by 
my partners in the voyage, I went on ooai-d in an 
evil nour, the [first] of [Septembei 1659], lieing the 
same day eight year that I went from my father and 
mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their 
authority, and the fool to my own interest 

Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried six 
guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy , 
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of 
goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade 
with the negroes — such a.s beads, bits of glass, 
shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses, 
knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on boaid we set sail, stand- 
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with 
design to stretch over for the African coast, when 
they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northeni 
latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their 


course in those days. 


We had very good weather, 
[44] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


only excessive hot, all the way upon our own coast, 
till we came the height of Cape St. Augustino, from 
whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of 
land, and steered as if we was bound for the Lsle 
Fernando de Noroiiha, holding our course NE. by 
N., and leaving those i&l&s on the east. In this 
course we passed the line in about twelve days' 
time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees 
22 minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, 
or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowled^. 
It began from the south-east, came about to the 
north-west, and then settled into the north-east, 
from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that 
for twelve day.s together we could do nothing but 
drive, and, scudding awav before it, let it carry us 
wherever fate and the fury of the winds directed ; 
and dunng these twelve days, I need not say that I 
expected every day to be swallowed up, nor, indeed, 
did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress we had, besides the tenor of the 
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and 
one in.an and the boy washed overboard. About the 
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master 
made an observation as well as he could, and found 
that he was in about 11 digrees north latitude, but 
that he w’as 22 degrees of longitude difference west 
from Cape St. Augustino ; so that he found he was 
gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part 
of Brazil, beyond the river Ama/on, toward that of 
the nser Orinoco, commonly called the Great River, 
and began to consult wnth me w'hat course he should 
take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, 
and he was going directly back to the coast of 
Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over 
the charts of the sea-coast of A merica with him, we 
concluded there was no inhabited country foi us to 
, [ 45 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


have recourse to till we came within the circle of 
the Carribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to 
stand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off at 
sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of 
Mexico, we might easily perforin, as we hoped, in 
about fifteen days’ sail; whereas we could not 
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa 
without some assistance, both to our ship and to 
ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and 
steered away NW. by W. in order to reach some of 
our English islands, where I hoped for relief, but 
our voyage was otherwise determined , for being in 
the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second 
storm came upon us, which carried us away with the 
same impetuosity wcstwai'd, and drove us so out of 
the very way of all human commerce, that had all 
our lives b^n saved, as to the sea, we were lather 
in danger of being devoured by savages than ever 
reluming to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very bard, 
one of our men early in the morning cned out, 
“ Land ' ” and we had no sooner ran out of the 
cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in 
the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, 
and 111 a moment, her motion being so stopped, the 
sea broke over her in such a manner, that we ex- 
pected we should all have perished immediately; 
and we were immediately driven into our close 
quarters, to shelter us from the Very foam and spray 
of the sea. 

It IS not easy for any one, who has not been in 
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con- 
sternation of men in such circumstances. We knew 
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was 
we were driven, whether an island or the main, 
whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the 
[ 46 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


rage of the wind was still great, though rather less 
than at first, we could not so much as hope to have 
the ship hold many minutes without breaking in 
pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should 
turn immediately about. In a word, we sat look- 
ing one upon another, and expecting death every 
moment, and every man acting accoi'dingly, as pre- 
pinng for another world, for there was little or 
nothing more for us to do in this. That which was 
our present comfort, and all the comfort we had, 
was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did 
not break yet, and that the master said the wind 
began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a 
little abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon 
the sand, and sticking too fast foi* us to expect her 
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, 
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our 
lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our 
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved 
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the 
next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was 
driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her; 
we had another boat on board, but how to get her 
off into the sea was a doubtful thing. However, 
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship 
would break in pieces every minute, and some told 
us she was actually broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of 
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men 
they got her slung over the ship’s side ; and getting 
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being 
eleven in number, to God's inercy. and the wild sea; 
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet 
the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and 
might well be called den wild zee, as the Dutch call 
the sea in a storm. 

[ 47 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we 
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the 
boat could nut live, and that we should be inevit- 
ably drowned. As to making sail, we had none , nor, 
if we had, could we have done anything with it; so 
we worked at the oar towawls the land, though with 
heavy hearts, like men going to execution, foi we all 
knew that when the boat came nearer the shore, she 
would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the bi%ach 
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to 
God in the most earnest manner , and the wind driv- 
ing us towards the shore, w'e hastened our destruction 
with our own hands, puUing as well as we could 
towards land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether 
steep or shoal, we knew not, the only hope that 
could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta- 
tion was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, 
or the mouth of some nver, where by great chance 
we might have run our boat in, or got undei the 
lee of the land, and pcriiaps made smooth watei. 
But there was nothing of this appeared , but as we 
made nearer and iiearet the shore, the land looked 
more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly 
bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it 
took us with such a fury, that it ovei'set the boat at 
once , and' separating us, as well from the boat as 
from one another, gave us nut time hardly to say, 
“ O God ' ” for we were all swallowed up in a 
moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought 
which I felt when I sunk into the watei , for though 
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from 
the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave hav- 
[ 48 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ing driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on 
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went Wk, 
and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead 
with the water I took in. I had so much presence 
of mind, as well as bi-eath left, that seeing myself 
nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my 
feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land 
as fast as I could, before another wave should return 
and take me up again. But I soon found it was im- 
possible to avoid it ; for I saw the sea come after me 
as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, 
which I had no means or strength to contend with. 
My business was to hold my breath, and raise myself 
upon the water, if I could ; and so, by swimming, to 
preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the 
shore, if possible ; my greatest concern now being, 
that the sea, as it would carry me a great way 
towards the shore when it came on, might not carry 
me back again with it when it gave back towards 
the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at 
once 20 or 30 feet deep in its own body, and I 
could fepl myself carried with a mighty force and swift- 
ness towaixis the shore a very great way ; but I held 
my bi-eath, and assisted myself to swim still forward 
with all my might. I was ready to burst with hold- 
ing my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, 
to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands 
shoot out above the surface of the water ; and though 
it was not two seconds of time that I could keep 
myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath 
and new courage. I was covered again with water a 
good while, but not so long but I held it out ; and 
finding the water had spent itself, and began to re- 
turn, I struck forward against the return of the 
waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood 
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the 
voi I. — * [ 49 j 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


water went from me, and then took to my heels and 
ran with what strength I had farther towards the 
shore. But neithci would this deliver me from the 
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me 
again, and twice more I was lifted up by the waves 
and carried forwards as before, the shore being very 
flat. 

The last time of these two had well near been 
fatal to me . for the sea, having hurried me along as 
before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a 
piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it left me 
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliver- 
ance : for the blow taking my side and breast, beat 
the hreath as it were quite out of my body ; and had 
it returned again immediately, I must have been 
strangled in the water. But I recovered a little be- 
fore the return of the waves and seeing I should be 
covered again with the water, I rosolved to hold fast 
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if 
possible, till the wave went back. Now as the 
waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I 
held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched 
another run, which brought me so near the shore, 
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did 
not so swallow me up as to carry me away, and the 
next run I took I got to the mainland, where, to my 
great comfort, I clainbei'ed up the clifife of the shore, 
and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, 
and quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to 
look up and thank God that my life was saved in a 
case wheiein there was some minutes before scarce 
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex- 
press to the life what the ecstasies ana transports of 
the soul aro when it is so saved, as I may say, out of 
the very ^ave ; and I do not wonder now at that 
custom, viz., that when a malefactor, who has the 
[ 60 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to 
be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him — I 
say, I do not wonder that they bring a suigeon with 
it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him 
of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal 
spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him : 

“ For sudden joys, like gnefs, confound at first” 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, 
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the 
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand 
gestures and motions which I cannot descnbe, reflect- 
ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and 
that there should not be one soul saved but myself ; 
for, as for them, I never -saw them afterwards, or any 
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, 
and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the 
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could 
hardly sec it, it lay so far off, and considered, I.4)rd ' 
how was it possible I could get on shore ? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable 
part of my condition, I began to look round me to 
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next 
to he done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and 
that, in a woi-d, I had a dreadiul deliverance , for I 
was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything 
either to cat or drink to comfort me, neither did 1 
see any prospect before me but that of perishing 
with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts ; and 
that which was particularly afilicting to me was, that 
I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature 
for ray sustenance, or to defend myself against any 
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. 
In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a 
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. I'his 
was all my provision ; and this threw me into ter- 
[ 61 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


rible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about 
like a madman. Night coming upon me, 1 began, 
with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my 
lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, 
seeing at night they always come abroad for their 
prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that 
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, 
but thorny, which giew near me, and where I resolved 
to sit all night, and consider the next day what death 
I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I 
walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I 
could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to 
my great joy ; and having drank, and put a little 
tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to 
the tiee, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place 
myself so, as that if I should sleep I might not fall ; 
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, 
for my derence, I t(M>k up my lodging, and having 
been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept 
as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in 
my condition, and found myself the most refreshed 
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, 
and the storm abated, .so that the sea did not rage 
and swell as before. But that which surprised me 
most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night 
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the 
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock 
which I first mentioned, where I hod been so bruised 
by the dashing me against it. Tliis being within 
about a mile mm the shore where I was, and the 
ship seeming to stand upnght still, I wished myself 
on Doard, that, at least, I might have some necessary 
things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the 
tree I looked about me again, and the first thing I 
[62] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the 
sea had tossed her upon the land, about two miles 
on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon 
the shore to have got to her, but found a neck or 
inlet of water between me and the boat, which was 
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the 
present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, 
where I hoped to find something for my present 
subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the .sea very calm, and 
the tide ebbed .so far out, that I could come within 
a quarter of a mile of the ship ; and here I found a 
fresh renewing of inv grief, for I saw evidently, that 
if w’e had kept on board we had been all safe, that is 
to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not 
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of 
all comfort and company, as T now was. This foi’ced 
tears from my eyes again , but as there was little 
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the 
ship ; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was 
hot to extremity, and took the water. But when I 
came to the ship, mv difficulty was still greater to 
know how to get on boaid , for as she lay aground, 
and high out of the water, there was nothing within 
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, 
and the second time I spied a small piece of a rope, 
which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down 
by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty 
I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up 
into the foreca.stle of the ship. Here I found that 
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water 
in her hold, but that .she lay so on the side of a 
bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern 
lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost 
to the water. By this means all her quarter was 
free, and all that was in that part was dry ; for you 
may be sure my first work was to search and to see 
[ 63 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


what was spoiled and what was free. And first I 
found that all the ship's provisions were dry and un- 
touched by the water , and being very v’ell disposed to 
eat, I went to the bread-room and filled iny pockets 
with biscmit, and eat it as I went about other things, 
for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum 
in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and 
which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for 
what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a 
boat, to fumish myself with many things which I 
foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was 
not to be had, and this extremity roused my applica- 
tion. We had several spare yards, and two or three 
large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in 
the ship. I re.solved to fall to work with these, and 
fiung as many of them overboard as I could manage 
for tiieir weight, tying every one with a rope, that 
they might not drive away. When this was done I 
went dow'n the ship’s side, and, pulling them to me, 
I tied four of them fast together at both ends as well 
as I could, in the form of a raft ; and laying two or 
three short pieces of plank upon them crossway.s, I 
found I could walk upon it very w^ell, but that it was 
not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being 
too light. So I went to work, and with the carpen- 
ter’s saw I cut a spare top-mast into three len^hs, 
and added them to my raft, with a great deal of 
labour and pains ; but hope of furnishing myself with 
necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should 
have been able to have done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strung enough to bear any reason- 
able weight. My next care was what to load it with, 
and how to pr^rve what I laid upon it from the 
surf of the sea ; but I wa.s not long considering this. 
I first laid all the planks or boaras upon it that I 
could get, and having considered well what I most 
[64J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, which 
I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them 
down upon my raft. The first of these I filled with 
provisions, viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five 
pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much 
upon, and a little remainder of European corn, which 
had been laid by for some fowls which we brought 
to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had 
been some barley and wheat together, but, to my 
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the 
rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I 
found se\eral eases of bottles belonging to our skip- 
per, in which were some cordial watere, and, in all, 
about five or six gallons of rack. These I stow'cd by 
themselves, there being no need to put them into the 
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing 
this, I found the tide b^pn to flow, though very 
calm, and I had the mortification to see my coat, 
shirt, and waistcoat, which 1 had left on shore upon 
the sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were 
only linen, and open-kneed, I .swam on board in 
them, and my stockings. However, this put me 
upon runiniaging for clothes, of which 1 found 
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present 
use ; for I had other things which my eye was more 
upon, as first tools to work with on shore ; and it 
was after long searching that I found out the car- 
penter’s chest, which was indeed a very useful prize 
to me, and much more valuable than a ship-loading 
of gold would have been at that time. I got it 
down to my raft, even whole as it was, without To.sing 
time to look into it, for I knew in general what it 
contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arras ; 
there were two very good fowling-pieces in the great 
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured firet, with 
some powder-horns, and a small bag of shot, and 
[ 55 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


two old rusty swords. I knew there were three 
barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where 
out gunner had stowed them ; but with much search 
I found them, two of them dry and good, the third 
had taken water ; those two I got to iiiy raft with 
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well 
freighted, and began to think how I should get to 
shorn with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder, 
and the least capful of wind would have overset all 
my navigation. 

I had three encouragements. 1. A smooth, calm 
sea, 2. The tide rising and .setting in to the shore. 
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the 
land. And thus, having found two or three broken 
oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools 
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, 
and a hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. 
For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, 
only that I found it dnve a little distant from the 
place where I had landed before, by which I perceived 
that there was some indraft of the water, and conse- 
quently I hoped to find some creek oi river there, 
which I might make use of as a port to get to land 
with nw cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was, there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong 
current of the tide set into it, so I guided iny raft 
as well as I could to keep in tile middle of the stream. 
But here I had like to have suffered a second ship- 
wreck, which, if I had, I think venly would have 
broke my heart , for knowing nothing of the coast, 
my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, 
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted 
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. 
I did my utmost by setting my back against the 
chests to keep them in their places, but could not 
[ 66 ] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


thrust off the raft with all my strenrfh, neither 
durst I stir from the posture I was in, out holding 
up the chests with all iny might, stood in that 
manner near half-an-hour, in which time the rising 
of the water brought me a little more upon a level ; 
and a little after, the water still rising, my raft 
floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had 
into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at 
length found myself in the mouth of a little river, 
with land on both sides, and a strong curi'ent or tide 
running up. I looked on both sides for a proper 
place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be 
driven too high up the nver, hoping in time to see 
some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place 
myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore 
of the creek, to which, with gi-eat pain and difficulty, 
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that, 
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her 
directly in , but here I had like to have dipped all 
my cargo in the sea c^ain ; for that shore lying 
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no 
place to land but where one end of my float, if it 
run on shore, would he so high and the other sink 
lower, os before, that it would endanger my cargo 
again. All that I could do was to wait till the tide 
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar 
like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the 
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected 
the water would now over ; and so it did. As soon 
as I found water enough, for my raft drew about a 
foot of water, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of 
ground, and there fastened or moored her by sticking 
my two broken oars into the ground ; one on one side 
near one end, and one on the other side near the 
other end ; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, 
and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


My next work was to view the country and seek a 
proper place for niy habitation, and where to stow 
my goods to secure them from whatever might happen. 
Where I was, I yet knew not ; whether on the conti- 
nent, or on an island , whether inhabited, or not in- 
habited ; whether in danger of wild beasts, or not. 
There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which 
rose lip very steep and high, and which seemed to 
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge 
from it, northwaid. I took out one of the fowling- 
pieces and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, 
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the 
top of that hill, where, after I had with great labour 
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to iny 
great affliction, viz , that I was in an island environed 
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except 
some rocks which lay a great w-ay off, and two small 
islands less than this, which lay about thice leagues 
to the west. 

T found also that the island I was in was baiTen, 
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, 
except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw 
none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not 
their kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I 
tell what was fit for food, and what not. At niy 
coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw 
sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood. I 
believe it was the first gun that had bren fired there 
since the creation of the world. I had no sooner 
fired, but from all the parts of the wood there arose an 
innumerable number of fowls of many sorts, making 
a confused .screaming, and crying every one accord 
ing to his usual note ; but not one of them of any 
kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I 
took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak 
resembling it, but had no talons or claws more than 
common ; its' flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing. 
[ 58 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Contented with this discovery, I came back to my 
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, 
which took me up the rest of that day ; and what to 
do with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed 
where to rest ; for I was afraid to lie down on the 
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might 
devour me, though, as I aiterwards found, there was 
really no neetl for those fears. However, as well as 
I could, I barricaded myself round with the chests 
and boards that I had brought on shore, and made 
a kind of a hut for that night's lodging; as for food, 
I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except 
that I had seen two or three creatures like hares 
run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a 
great many things out of the ship, which would be 
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging 
and sails, and such other things as might eome to 
land, and I lesolved to make another voyage on 
board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that 
the first storm that blew must iieccssanly break her 
all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart 
till I got everything oubof Rie ship that I could get. 
Then I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, 
whether I should take back the raft, but this appeared 
impracticable; so I resolroi to go as before, when 
the tide was down ; and I did so, only that I stripped 
before I went from my hut, having nothing on out 
a chequered shirt and a pair of linen drawers, and a 
pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared 
a second raft, and having had experience of the 
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded 
it so halt! , but yet I brought away several things 
very useful to me ; as, fimt, in the carpenter’s stores 
I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, 
a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatcheta and 

[ 59 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. 
All these I secured, together with several things 
belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three 
iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven 
muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small 
quantity of powder more ; a large bag full of small- 
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead ; hut this last 
was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over 
the ship’s side. Besides these thin^, I took all the 
men’s clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top 
sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; and with this 
I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe 
on shore, to my very great comfort. 

I was under some apprehensions during my ab- 
sence from the land, that at least my provisions 
might be devoured on shore , but when I came back, 
I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a crea- 
ture like a wildcat upon one of the chests, which, 
when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, 
and then stood still. She sat very composed and 
unconcei-ned, and looked full in my face, as if she 
had a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented 
my gun at her ; but as she did not understand it, she 
was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to 
stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, 
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, foi my 
store was not great However, I spared her a bit, I 
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and 
looked (as jileased) foi more , but I thanked her, and 
could spare no more, so she marched off. 

Having got ray second cargo on shore, though I 
was fain to open the bairels of powder and bring 
them W parcels, for they were too heavy, being large 
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent with 


the sail and some pules which I cut for that pur- 

E ose ; and into this tent I brought everything that I 
new would spoil either with ram or sun , ana I piled 
[ 60 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


all the emp^ chests and casks up in a circle round 
the tent, to rortify it from any sudden attempt, either 
from man or beast 

When I had done this I blocked up the door of 
the tent with some boards within, and an empty 
chest set up on end without , and spreading one of 
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just 
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to 
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all 
night, for I was very weary and heavy ; for the night 
before I had slept little, and had laboured veiy hard 
all day, as well to fetch all those things from the 
ship, as to get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that 
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man ; but I was 
not satisfied .still, for while the ship sat upright in 
that posture, I thought I ought to get everything 
out of her that I could. So every day at low water 
I went on boaid, and brought away something or 
other; but, particularly, the thii4 time I went I 
brought Away as much of the rigging as I could, 
as also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could 
get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend 
the sails upon occasion, the liari el of wet gunpow der ; 
in a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, 
only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring 
as much at a time as I could ; foi they were no more 
useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more still was, that 
at last of all, after I hod made five or six such voy- 
ages as these, and thought I had nothing more to 
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling 
with ; I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead 
of bread, and three large nmlets of rum or spiiits, 
and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour , this 
was surprising to me, liecause I had given over ex- 
pecting any more provisions, except w^t was spoilt 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that 
bread, and wrapped it up parcel by parcel in pieces 
of the sails, which I cut out , and, in a word, I got 
all this safe on shore also 

The next day I made another voyage. And now, 
having plundered the ship of what was portable and 
fit to hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting 
the gi^at cable into pieces, such as I could move, f 
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the 
ironwork I could get , and having cut down the 
sprit-sailyard, and the iiiizzen-yard, and everything 
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all 
those heavy goods, and came away. But rny good 
luck began now to leave me ; for this raft was so 
unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was enteied 
the little cove where I had landed the rest of my 
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did 
the other, it ovei>et, and threw me and all iny caigo 
into the water As for myself, it was no great harm, 
for I was near the shore, but as to my cargo, it was 
great part of it lost, es|)ec‘ially the iron, which I ex- 
pected would have Ix-en of gieat use to me. How- 
ever, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces 
of cable ashore, uiid some of the iron, tliough with 
infinite labour , foi I was fain to dip for it into the 
water, a work w'liieh fatigueil me very much. After 
this I went cveiy day on board, and brought away 
what I could get 

I had been now thii+etm days on shore, and had 
been eleven times on board the ship , in which time 
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could 
well be supposed capable to biing, though I believe 
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have 
brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But 
preparing the twelfth time to go on boaixl, I found 
the wind begin to rise. However, at low water I 
went on board, and though I thought I had rum- 
[ 62 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing 
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker 
with drawere in it, in one of which I found two or 
three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with 
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; in 
another, I found about thirty-six pounds value in 
money, some Euiopean com, some Brazil, some pieces 
of eight, some gold, some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 
“ O drug ' ’’ said I aloud, “ what art thou good for f 
Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off of 
the ground, one of those knives is worth all this 
heap I have no manner of use for thee ; even re- 
main where thou art, and go to the bottom as a 
ci«ature whose life is not worth saving.” However, 
upon second thoughts, I took it away , and wrapping 
all this in a piece of canvas, I liegan to think of mak- 
ing another laft, but while I was preparing this, I 
found the sk> o\crcast, and the wind Wgan to rise, 
and in a quaiter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from 
the shore. It presently oc-curred to me that it was 
in vain to pretend to make a iuft with the wind off 
shore, and that it was my business to be gone before 
the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be 
able to reach the shore at all. Accoi-diiigly I let 
myself down into the water, and swam aci-oss the 
channel, which lay betw'sen the ship and the sands, 
and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the 
weight of the things I had about me, and partly the 
roughness of the water , for the wind rose very has- 
tily, and before it was quite high water it blew a 
storm 


But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I 
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It 
blew very hal'd all that night, and in the morning, 
when I looked out, behold, no moi-e ship was to be 
seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered myself 
[ 63 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


with this satisfactory reflection, viz., that I had lost 
no time, nor abated no diligence, to get everything 
out of her that could be useful to me, and that in- 
deed there was little left in her that I waa able to 
bring away if I had had more time. 

I npw gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or 
of anything out of her, extimt what might drive on 
shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her 
aftcrwaids did , but those things were of small use 
to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about 
securing myself against cither savages, if any should 
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island ; and 
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, 
and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should 
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the 
earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both, the 
manner and description of which it may not be im- 
proper to give an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my 
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low 
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed w ould not 
be wholesome , and more particularly because there 
was no fresh water near it So I resolved to find a 
more healthy and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted seveial things in my situation, which I 
found would be proper for me. First, healtli and 
f^esh water, I just now mentioned. Secondly, shelter 
from the heat of the sun. 'I’hinlly, security from 
ravenous creatures, whether men oi brasts. Fourthly, 
a \ lew to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight 
I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, 
of which I was not willing to Imnish all my expecta- 
tion yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little 
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards 
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


nothing could come down upon me from the top , on 
the side of tlii> rock there was a hollow place, worn a 
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave ; 
but there wa* not really any cave, or way into the 
rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow 
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was 
not above an hundred yards broad, and about twice 
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at 
the end of it descended irregularly every way down 
into the low grounds by the seaside. It was on the 
NNW side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from 
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. 
sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries is near 
the setting. 

Before I set up rny tent, I drew a half circle before 
the hollow place, which took m about ten yards in its 
senii-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its 
diameter from its beginning and ending. In this 
half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driv- 
ing them into the ground till they stood very firm 
like piles, the biggest end bmng out' of the ground 
about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top 
The two rows did not stand above six inches from 
one another. 

'rhen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in 
the ship, and laid ^em in rows one upon another, 
within the circle, between these two rows of stakes, 
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside lean- 
ing against them, about two feet and a half high, 
like a spur to a post ; and this fence was .so strong, 
that neither man or beast could get into it, or over 
it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, 
especially to cut the piles in the woixls, bring them 
to the place, and drive them into the eaith. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not bjr a 
door, but by a short ladder to go ovei the top , which 

VOL. I — s [ ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me, and so 
I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought, 
from all the world, and consetiuently slept secure in 
the night, which otherwise I could not have done, 
though as it appeared afterward, there was no need 
of all this caution from the enemies that I appre- 
hended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I 
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, 
and stores, of which you have the account above ; and 
I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me from 
the rains that in one part of the year are very violent 
there, I made double, viz., one smaller tent within, 
and one largei tent above it, and coveietl the iippei- 
inost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among 
the sails. And now I lay no more foi- a while in the 
bed which I had brought on shore, but in a ham- 
mock, which was indera a very good one, and be- 
longed to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and 
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having 
thus encloseil all my goods, I made up the entrance, 
which, till now, I had left open, and so passed and 
repassed, a.s I said, by a .short ladder. 

When I had done this, I tx*gan to work my way 
into the rock , and hriiiging all the earth and stones 
that I dug down out through my tent, I laid them 
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so 
that it raised the ground within about a foot and a 
half; and thus I made me a cave just behind my 
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all 
these things were brought to perfection, and there- 
fore I must go back to some other things which took 
up some of nre thoughts. At the same time it hap- 
pened, after 1 had laid my scheme for the setting up 
my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain 
[ 66 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of 
lightning happened, and after that a great clap of 
thunder, as is naturally the eflec-t of it I was not so 
much surprised with the lightning, as I was with a 
thought which darted into my mind as swift as the 
lightning itself. 0 iny powder ! My very heart 
sunk witliin me when I thought, that at one blast all 
my powder might be destroyed, on which, not my 
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, 
entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious 
about my own danger ; though had the powder took 
fire, I had never known who had hurt me 

Such impression did.this make upon me, that after 
the storm was over I laid aside all my works, my 
building, and fortifying, and applied myself to make 
bags and boxes to separate the powder, and keep it 
a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever 
might come it might not all take fire at once, and 
to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible 
to make one part fire another. I finished this work 
in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, 
which in all was about 240 pounds weight, was 
divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As to 
the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend 
any daiigei frem that, so I placed it in my new care, 
which in my fancy I called my kitchen, and the rest 
I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that 
no wet might come to it, marking very carefully 
where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went 
out once, at least, eveiy day with my gun, as well to 
divert myself, os to see if I could kill anything fit for 
food, and as near as I could to ac(]uaint myself with 
what the island produced. The first time I went out, 
I presently discovered that there were goats m the 
Island, which was a great satisfiudinii to me ; but then 
it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz., that 
[67] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that 
it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at 
them. But I was not discouraged at this, nut doubt- 
ing but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon 
happened , for after I had found their haunts a little, 
I laid wait in this manner for them. I observed if 
they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon 
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fri^t ; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was 
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me, from 
whence I concluded that, by the position of their 
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that 
they did not i-eadily see object? that were above them. 
So afterward I took this method ; I always climbed 
the rocks first to get above them, and then had fre- 
quently a fair mark. The first shot I made among 
these creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little 
kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me 
heartily ; but when the old one fell, the kid stood 
stock still by her till 1 came and took her up ; and 
not. only so, but when I carried the old one with me 
upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my 
enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and 
took the kid in mv arms, and earned it over my pale, 
in hopes to have hred it up tame; but it would not 
eat, so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These 
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat 
sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread espe- 
cially, as much as pos.sibIy I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso- 
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, 
and fiiel to burn , and what I did for that, as also 
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I 
made, I shall give a full account of in its place. 
But I must first give some little account of myself, 
and of my thoughts about living, which it may well 
be supposm were not a few. 

[ 68 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I had a dismal prospect of my condition ; for as I 
was not cast away upon that island without being 
dnven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite out m 
the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, 
viz., some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary 
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason 
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in 
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I 
should end my life. The teai-s would run plenti- 
fully down my face when I made these reflec*tioiis, 
andf sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why 
Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures, 
and render them so absolutely miserable, so without 
help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could 
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to 
check these thoughts, and to reprove me , and par- 
ticularly one day, walking w ith my gun in my hand 
by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject 
of my present condition, wlien Reason, as it were, 
expostulated with me t’other waj, thus: “Well, 
you are in a desolate coiidihon it is true, but pray 
remember, where are the rest of you Did not you 
come eleven of you into the boat ? Where are the 
ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost'’ 
Why were you singled out ? Is it better to be here, 
or there ? ” And then I pointed to the sea. All 
evils are to be considered with the good that is in 
them, and with what worse attends them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was fur- 
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been 
my case if it had not happened, which was an hun- 
dred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the 
place where she first struck and was dnven so near 
to the shore that I had time to get all these things 
out of her ; what would have been my case, if I had 
been to liave lived in the condition in which I at 
[ 69 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


first came on shore, without necessaries of life, or 
necessaries to supply and procure them ? “ Par- 

ticularly,” said I aloud (though to myself), “ what 
should I have done without a gun, without ammu- 
nition, without any tools to make anything or to 
work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any 
manner of covering ? " and that now I had all these 
to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to 
provide myself in such a iiiaimer, as to live without 
my gun when my ammunition was spent ; so that I 
had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want 
as long as I lived. For I considered frain tne be- 
ginning how I would provide for the accidents that 
might happen, and for the tune that was to come, 
even not only after inv ammunition should be spent, 
but even after my health or strength should decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my 
ammunition being destroyed at one blast — I mean, 
my powder being blown up by lightning ; and this 
made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it 
lightened and timndered, as I observed just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy rela- 
tion of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was 
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it 
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It 
was, by my account, the 80th of September when, 
in the manner as above said, I fiist set foot upon 
this horrid island, when the sun being to us in its 
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head, 
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the 
latitude of 9 degiees 22 minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, 
it came into my thoughts that I should lose my 
reckoning of time for want of books and pen and 
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from 
the working days ; but to prevent this, I cut it with 
my knife upon a large nost, in capital letters ; and 

no] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore 
where I first landed, viz., “ I came on shore here on 
the 80th of September 1659.” Upon the sides of 
this square post I cut every day a notch with my 
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as 
the rest, and every first day of the month as long again 
as that long one ; and thus I kept my calendar, or 
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next place we are to observe, that among 
the many things which I brought out of the ship in 
the .several voyages, which, as above mentioned, I 
made to it, I got several tilings of less value, but 
not all less useful to me, whiw I omitted setting 
down before , as in particular, pen.s, ink, and paper, 
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and 
carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some 
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, 
and books of navigation, all which I huddled to- 
gether, whether I might want them or no. Also I 
mund three very good Bibles, which came to me in 
mv cargo from England, and which I had packed 
up among my things ; some Portuguese books also, 
and among them two or three Popish prayer-books, 
and spverd other books, all which I carefully secured. 
And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a 
dog and two cats, of who.se eminent history I may 
have occasion to say something in its place ; for I 
carried both the cats with me ; and as for the dog, 
he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on 
shore to me the day after I went on shore with my 
first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many 
years. I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he could make up to me ; I 
only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would 
not do. As 1 observed before, I found pen, ink, and 
paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and 
I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept things 
[71] 



ROUINSON CRUSOE 


very exact ; but after that was gone, I could not, 
for I could not make any ink by any means that I 
could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many 
things, notwithstanding all that I had amas.sed to- 
gether ; and of these, this of ink was one, as also 
sfiade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the 
earth, needles, pins, and thread ; as for linen, I soon 
learned to want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on 
heavily, and it w'as near a whole year before I had 
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habita- 
tion. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I 
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre- 
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing 
home , so that I sjKsnt sometiines two days in cutting 
and bringing home one of tliose posts, and a third 
day in driving it into the ground, for which pur- 

E ose I got a hcav y piece of wood at first, but at last 
ethought myself of one of the iron crows, which, 
hovvf.tjrt' , ’Ugh I found it, yet it made driving 
those posts 6i ’ ' '•ry laboiious and tedious work. 

But what ne»5(f' I ave lx*en concerned at the 
tediousne.ss of anything I l-'d to do, seeing I had 
time enough to do it in ? nor hiul ^ ..uy other em- 
ployment, if that had lieen over, at least, +hat I 
could foresee, except thi ranging the island to seek 
for food, which I did more or less every day 
I now began to consider seriously niy condition, 
and the circumstance I wa.s reduced to , and I drew 
up the state of iiiy affairs in wi iting , not so much 
to leave them to any that were to come after me, for 
I was like to have but few heirs, as to delivei my 
thoughts from daily pouring upon them, and afflict- 
ing my mind. And as my reason began now to 
master my despondency, I began to comfort my.self 
as well as I could, and to set the good against the

evil, that I might have something to distinguish my 
case from worse, and I stated it very impartially, 
hke debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed 
against the miseries I suffered, thus : 


Evtl. 

1 am cast upon a horri- 
ble desolate island, void of 
all hope of recovery 
I am singled out and

all the world to be miser- 
able.

But I am alive, and not 
drowned, as all my ship’s 
company was 

But I am singled out, 
too, from all the ship’s 
crew to be spared from 
death ; and He that mira- 
culously saved me from 
death, can deliver me from 
this condition. 

But I am not starved 
and perishing on a barren

But I am cast on an

Africa , and what if 1 had 
been shipwrecked there ? 

But God wonderfully 
sent the ship m near 
enough to the shore, that 
I have gotten out so 
many necessary things as 
will either supply my 
wants, or enable me tii 
supply myself even as 
long as I live. 


[ 73 ] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi- 
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the 
world so miserable, but there was something nega- 
tive or something positive to be thankful for in it , 
and let this stand as a direction fioni the expericncr 
of the most miserable of all conditions in this world, 
that we may always find in it something to comfort 
ourselves from, and to set iii the dcseription of good 
and evil on the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish 
my condition, and given over looking out to sea, 
to see if I could spy a ship ; I sit\ , giving over these 
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my 
way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I 
could. 

I have already desenbed my habitation, which was 
a tent under the side of a rock, sunounded with a 
strong pale of posts and cables, but I might now 
rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up 
against it of tuifs, about two feet thick on the out- 
side, and after some time — I think it was a year 
and a half — I raised i-afters from it leaning to the 
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees 
and such things as I could get to keep out the rain, 
which I found at some times of the year \erv violent. 

I have already obser ed how I brought all my 
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had 
made behind me. But I must observe, too, that at 
first this was a confused heap of goods, which as they 
lay in no order, so thev took up all rny place , I had 
no room to turn myself. So I set myself to enlarge 
my cave and woi ks farther into the earth ; for it was 
a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 
I bestowed on it. And so, when I found I was pretty 
safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the 
right hand into the rock ; and then, turning to the 
right again, worked quite out, and made me a door 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to come out on the outside of my pale or fortifica- 
tion. This gave me not only egress and regress, as 
it were a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, 
but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as I found I most wanted, as par- 
ticularly a chair and a table ; for without thase I 
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the 
world. I could not write or eat. or do several things 
with so much pleasure without a table. 

So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe, 
that as reason is the substance and original of the 
mathematics, so by stating and squaring everything 
by reason, and bv making the most rational judg- 
ment of things, every man may be in time master of 
every mechanic art I had never handled a tool in 
my life , and yet in tune, by labour, application, and 
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing 
but I coulcl have mode it, especially if I had had 
tools. However, I made abundanc'e of tilings even 
without tools, and some with no more tools than an 
adiie and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made 
that way before, and that with infinite labour. For 
example, if I wanted a board, I hod no other way 
but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, 
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had 
brought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it 
smooth with niy adze It is true, by this method I 
could make but one board out of a whole tree , but 
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more 
than I had for the prodigious deal of time and la- 
bour which it took me up to make a plank or boaid. 
But mj time or labour was little worth, and so it 
was a.s well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I 
observed above, in the first place, and this I did out 
of the short pieces of boards that I brought on ray 
[ 76 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out 
some boards, as above, I made large shelves of the 
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all 
along one side of my cave, to lav all iny tools, nails, 
and iron-woi k , and, in a word, to separate every- 
thing at large in their places, that 1 might come 
easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of 
the rock to hang my guns and all things that would 
hang up ; so that hajd my cave been to be seen, it 
looked like a general magazine of all neccssaiy 
things ; and I had cverytliing so ready at my hand, 
that it w'as a great pleasure to me to see all my 
goods in such older, and especially to find my stock 
of all necessaries so gmit. 

And now it was when I li^an to keep a journal of 
every day's oniploymoiit , tbi, indeed, at fiist, I was 
in too much hurry, and not only huiTy as to labour, 
but in too much discomposure of mind , and my 
journal would have Ix'en full of many dull things. 
For example, I must have said thus Si'pt the ‘Mth. — 
After I got to shore, and had escaped drowning, in- 
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, 
having first vomited w ith the great ijuantity of .salt 
water which was gotten into my stoinacb, and re- 
covering myself a little, I ran about the shore, 
wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, 
exclaiming at iiiy misery, ami crying out, I was un- 
done, undone, till, tired and faint, I was forced to he 
down on the ground to repose , but dui st not .sleep, 
for feai* of being devoumi 

Some days after this, and after I liad lx‘en on board 
the ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet 
I could not forbear getting up to the top of a little 
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing 
a ship ; then fancy at a vast distance 1 spied a sail, 

i ilease myself with the hopes of it, and then, after 
ooking steadily till I was dmost blind, lo.se it quite, 
[ 76 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase 
my misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things in some 
measure, and having settled my household stuff and 
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as 
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep iny 
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy 
(though in it will be told all these particulars over 
again) as long as it lasted , for, having no more ink, 
I was forced to leave it off. 

THE JOURNAL 

September 30, 1659. — I, poor miserable Robinson 
Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, 
in the offing, came on shoi^ on this dismal unfoi'tiinate 
island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the 
rest of the ship’s company being drowned, and myself 
almost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself 
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I 
had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to 
fly to , and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but 
death before me ; either that I should be devoured 
by wild lieasts, murdered by savages, or starved to 
death for want of food. At the appioach of night, 
I slept in a tree for fear of wild cieatures, but slept 
soundly, though it rained aU night. 

October 1. — In the morning I saw, to my great 
surprise, the ship had floated w ith the high tide, and 
was driven on shore ogam much nearer the island , 
which, as it was some comfort on one hand, for see- 
ing her sit upi ight, and not bioken to pieces, I hoped, 
if the wind abated, I might get on Iward, and get 
some food and necessaries out of her for my relief ; 
.so, on the other hand, it renewed my gnef at the loss 
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed 

[77J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


on board, might have saved the ship, or at least that 
they would not have been all drowned as they were ; 
and that had the men been saved, we might perhaps 
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to 
have carried us to some othci part of the world. I 
spent great part of this day in perplexing iii_> self on 
these things ; but at length seeing the ship almost 
dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and 
then swam on board ; this day also it continued rain- 
ing, though with no w ind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the — All these 
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get 
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on 
shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much ram 
also in these days, though with some intervals of fair 
weather ; but, it seems, this %vas the rainy season. 

Oct. 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I 
had got upon it , but being in shoal water, and the 
things being chiefly hea\y, I recovered many of them 
when the tide was out. 

Oct. 25. — It rained all night and all day, with 
some gusts of wind, dining which time the ship 
broke in pieces, the wind olowiiig a little harder 
than befoix:, and was no inoie to be seen, except the 
wreck of her, and that only at low water I spent 
this day in covering and securing the goods which 
I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Oct. 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day 
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con- 
cerned to secure myself from an attack in the night, 
either from wild beasts or men. Tow^ards night I 
fixed upon a proper place under a luck, and marked 
out a semicircle for my encampment, which I re- 
solved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica- 
tion made of double piles, lined within with cables, 
and without with turfi 

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very bard in

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


canning all my goods to my new habitation, though 
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the 
island with my gun to see for some food, and dis- 
cover the country , when I killed a she-goat, and her 
kid followed me home, which I afterwarik killed also, 
because it would not feed 

Nov. 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay 
there for the first night, making it as large as I 
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock 
upon. 

Nov. S. — I set up all my chests and boards, and 
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with 
them formed a fence round me, a little within the 
place I had marked out for iny fortification. 

Nov. 3 — I went out with my gun, and killed two 
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the 
afternoon wont to work to make me a table. 

Nov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times 
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, 
and time of di\ei>ion, wz., every morning I walked 
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not 
lain ; then employed myself to work till about eleven 
o’clcxik, then eat what I had to live on ; and from 
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being 
excessive hot ; and then in the evening to work 
again. The working part of this day and of the 
next were wholly employed in making mv table , for 
I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time 
and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic 
soon after, as I believe it would do any one else. 

Nov. 5 — This day went abroad with my gun and 
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, 
but her flesh good for notliing. Evoiy creature I 
killed, I took off the skins and preserved them. Com- 
ing back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea- 
fowls, which I did not understand : but was surprised, 
[79] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and almost frighted, with two or three seals, which, 
while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they 
were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. — After my morning walk I went to woik 
with my table again, and finished it, though not to 
my liking ; nor was it long before I learned to mend 
it. 

Nov. 7. — Now it began to be settled fair 
weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 
12th (for the lllh was Sunday) I took wholly up to 
make me a chair, and with much ado, bi ought it to 
a tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and even 
in the making, I pulled it in pieces several times. 
Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, 
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot 
which was which. 

Nov. 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me 
exceedingly, and cooled the earth , but it was accom- 
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which 
frighted me dreadfully, for fcai of my powder As 
soon as it W'AS over, I resolveil to separate my stock 
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that 
it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spnt in 
making little square chests or boxes, which might 
hold about a pound, or two pound at most, of pow'der ; 
and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places 
as secure and remote from one another as possible. 
On one of these three days I killed a large bird that 
was good to eat, but I know not what to call it. 

Nov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my 
tent into the rock, to make room for my further con- 
venicncy. Note, three things I wanted exceedingly 
for this work, viz., a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel- 
barrow or basket , so I desisted from my w^ork, and 
began to consider how to supply that want, and 
m^e me some tools, As for a pick-axe, I made use 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 

of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though 
heavy ; but the next thing was a shovel or spade. 
This was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could 
do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of 
one to make, I knew noL 

Nov. 18. — The next day, in searching the woods, 
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the 
Brazils they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hard- 
ness ; of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling 
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, 
with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no 
other way, made me a long while upon this machine, 
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into 
the form of a shovel or sjiade, the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad 
part having no iron .sh<Kl upon it at bottom, it would 
not last me so long. However, it served well enough 
for the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but 
never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, 
or so long a-making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a 
wheelbarrow. A basket I could not make by any 
means, having no such things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found 
out And as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could 
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion 
of, iieitlier did I know how to go about it ; besides, 
I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons 
for the spindle or axis of the wheel to lun in, so I 
gave it over, and so for carrying away the earth 
which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing 
like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in, when 
they serve the bricklayers. 

This was not .so difficult to me as the making the 
shovel ; and yet this, and the shovel, and tlie attempt 
which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took

me up no less than four days ; I mean always, except- 
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom 
failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home 
something fit to eat. 

Nov. 23.' — My other work having now stood 
still because of my making these tools, when they 
were finished I went on, and working every day, as 
my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening niy cave, that it 
might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note During all this time I woiked to make 
this itiom or cave spacious enough to accommodate 
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining- 
room, and a cellar, as for my lodging, I kept to the 
tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of 
the year it rained so hanl, that I could not keep 
myself dry, which caused me aftcrwaids to cover 
all my place within mj’ pale with long poles, in the 
form of raflei’s, leaning against the rock, and load 
them with flags and large leave.< of trees, like a 
■ thatch. 

December 10 — I began now to think my cave or 
vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had 
made it too large) a great <|uantity of earth fell down 
from the top and one side, so much, that, in .short, 
it frighted me, and not without reason too , for if I 
had been under it, I hfid never wanted a grave-digger. 
Upon this disaster i had a great deal of work to do 
over again , for I had the loose earth to carry out ; 
and, which was of more importance. I had the ceiling 
to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would 
come down. 

Dec 11 . — This day I went to work w'lth it accoirl- 
ingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to 
the top, with two pieces of boards across over each 
post. This I dnisned the next day ; and setting 
more posts up with board.s, in about a week more I

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had the roof secured ; and the posts standing in rows, 
served me for partitions to part of my house. 

Dec. 17. — From this day to the twentieth I placed 
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hang 
everything up that could be hung up ; and now I 
began to be in some oider within doors 

Dec. 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, 
and began to furnish my house, and set up some 
pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals 
upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; 
also I made me another table. 

Dec. 24 — Much rain all night and all day , no 
stimng out. 

Dec. 25. — Rain all day. 

Dec. 26. — No rain, and the earth much cooler 
than before, and pleasanter. 

Dec. 27 — Killed a young goat, and lamed an- 
other, so that I catched it, and led it home in a 
string. When I had it home, I bouijd and splintei-ed 
up its leg, which was broke. N.B. — I took such 
<'are of it, that it lisetl, and the leg grew well and 
as strong as ever ; but by my nursing it so long it 
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, 
and would not go awa>. Tins wat. the first time 
that I entertained a thought of breeding up some 
tame creatures, that I might have food when my 
powder and shot was all .spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. — Great heats and no breeze, so 
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the 
evening, for food This time I spent in putting all 
my things in order within doors 

Januanf 1. — Very hot still, but I went abroad 
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the 
middle of the dav This 'veniiig, going farther 
into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the 
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though 
exceeding shy, and hard to come at. However, 1 
[831 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt 
them down. 

Jan. 2. — Accordingly, the next day, I went out 
with my dog, and set him upon the goats ; but I 
was mistaken, for they all feced about upon the 
dog; and he knew bis danger too well, for he would 
not come near them. 

Jan. 3 — I began my fence or wall ; which, being 
still jealous of my being attaekeil by somebody, I 
resolved to make very thick and strong. 

N B. — 'I'bis wall rieing described before, I pur- 
posely omit what was said in the journal. It is 
sufficient to observe that I was no less time than 
from the 3i(l of January to the 14th of April work- 
ing, finishing, and fieifccting this wall, though it 
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, 
being a half ciicle fioiii one place in the rock to 
another place aliout eight yards from it, the door of 
the cavetK'ing iji the centre behind it. 

All this tune I worked very liard, the rains hin- 
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks to- 
gether ; but I thought I should never be periectly 
secure till this wall was diiishcd. And it is scarce 
credible what inexpressible labour eveivthing was 
done with, especial]" the bringing piles out of 
the woods, and driving them into the giound ; for 
I made them much bigger than I need to have 
done. 

When this wall was finisheil, and the outside 
double-fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to it, 
I persuaded myself that if any people were to come 
on shore there, they would not perceive anything 
like a habitation , and it was very well I did so, as 
may be observed hereafter u|)un a very reiiiai kablc 
occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods 
[84] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and 
made frequent discoveries in these walks of some- 
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I 
found a kind of wild pigeons, who built, not as 
wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, 
in the holes of the rocks. And taking some young 
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did 
so ; but when they grew older they flew all away, 
which, perhaps, was at first for want of feeding 
them, for I had nothing to give them. However, I 
frequently found their nests, and got their young 
ones, which were very good meat. 

And now in the managing my household affaii’s 
I found myself wanting in many things, which I 
thought at fii-st it was impossible for me to make, 
as indeed, as to some of them, it was. For instance, 
I could never make a cask to be hooped , I had a 
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I 
could never arrive to the capacity of making one by 
them, tliuugh I spent many weeks about it. I could 
neither put in the heads, or joint the staves so true 
to one another, as to make them hold water ; so I 
gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss fur candle ; 
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was gen- 
erally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed. 
I leineinbeied the lump of beeswax wil£ which I 
made candles in my African adventure, but I had 
none of that now. I'he only remedy I had was, that 
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and 
with a little dish mmle of clay, which I baked in the 
sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I 
made me a lamp ; and this gave me light, though 
not a clear steady light like a candle. 

In the middle of all my labours it happened, that 
rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, 
as I hinted before, had been flUed with corn for the 
[ 86 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


feeding of poultrvj not for this voyage, but before, 
as 1 suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. 
What little I'emainder of corn had been in the bag 
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in 
the bag but husk and dust , and being willing to 
have the bag tbi some other use, I think it was 
to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the 
lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks of 
com out of it on one side of my fortification, under 
the rock. It was a little before the great rains, just 
now mentioned, that I threw tins stuff" away, taking 
no notice of anything, and not so iiiiich as I'emcm- 
bering that I had tiirowii anything there ; when, 
about a month after, or tJieivaliout, I saw some few 
stalks of something giccn shooting out of the ground, 
which I fancied might 1 k‘ some plant I had not seen ; 
but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, 
after a little longer time, I saw alxiut ten oi tw elve cars 
<‘ome out, which were peifcet green barley of the same 
kind as our European, nay, as our English bailey 
It is impossible to express the astonishment and 
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion I had 
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all , 
indeed, I had vciy few notions of ichgion in my 
head, or had cntci'hiined any sense of anything that 
had befallen me othcwise than as a chance, or, as 
we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much 
as inquiiing into the end of Providence in these 
things, or His order in governing events in the 
world. But after I saw barley grow there, in a 
climate which I know was not proper for com, and 
especially that I knew not how it came there, it 
startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that 
God had mitaculously caused this grain to grow 
without any help of seed sown, and that it was so 
directed purely for my sustenance on that wild mis- 
erable pl^. 

[ 86 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


This touched my heart a little, and brought tears 
out of my eyes , and' I began to bless myself, that 
such a prodigy of Nature should happen upon my 
account ; and this was the more strange to me, be- 
cause I saw near it still, all along by the side of the 
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to 
be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had 
seen it glow in Africa, when I was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of 
Providence for iny support, but, not doubting but 
that there was more in the place, I went all over 
that part of the island where I had been before, 
peering in every corner, and under every rock, to 
see for more of it ; but I could not find any. At 
last it occurred to iiiy thoughts that I had shook a 
bag of chicken’s meat out in that place, and then 
the wonder began to cease , and I must confess, my 
religious thankfulness to God’s piovulence began to 
abate too, upon the discovering that all this was 
nothing blit what was common ; though I ought to 
have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen 
providence, as if it had lieen miraculous ; for it was 
really the work of Providence as to me, that should 
order or appoint, that ten or twelve grains of com 
should remain unspoiled (when the rats had de- 
stroyed all the rest), as if it had been diojiped from 
heaven ; as also that I should throw it out in that 
particular place, whcie, it lieing in the shade of a 
high rock, it sprang up iiiiinediately , whereas, if I 
had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it hiwl 
lieen burnt up and destroyed 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be 
sure, in their season, which was about the end of 
June ; and, laying up every corn, I ie.solved to sow 
them all again, hoping in time to have some quan- 
tity sufficient to supply me with bread. But, it was 
not till the fourth year, that I could allow myself 

[ 87 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


least grain of this corn to eat, and even then 
but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order ; 
for 1 lost all that I sowed the first season, by not 
observing the proper time ; for I sowed it just be- 
fore the dry season, so that it never came up at all, 
at least not as it would have done ; of whim in its 
place. 

Besides this barley, there was, as above, twenty or 
thirty stalks of nee, which I preserved with the same 
care, and whose use was of the same kind, or to the 
same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather 
food , for I found ways to cook it up without baking, 
though I did that also after, some tune. But to re- 
turn to m3’ journal. 

I worked excessive hard these thi-ce or four months 
to get my w'all done; and the 14 th of Apnl I closetl 
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but 
over the wall b> a ladder, that there might be no 
sign in the outside of my habitation. 

^Api-U 16 . — I finished the laddei, so I went up 
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up 
after me, and let it down on the inside This was 
a complete enclosui'e to me, foi within I had 100m 
enough, and nothing could come at me ft 0111 without, 
unless it could first mount my wall 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I 
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and 
myself killed. The case was thus As I was busy 
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the en- 
trance into my cave, I w'a.s terribly frighted with a most 
dreadful surpnsing thing iridem , for all on a sud- 
den I found the earth come cioimblnig down fixnn the 
roof of my cave, and from the etlge of the hill over 
my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the 
cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily 
scared, but thought nothing of what was really the 
cause, only thinking that the tup of iny cave was

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

falling in, as some of it had done before , and for 
fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to iny 
ladder ; and not thinking myself safe there neither, 
I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill 
which I expected might roll down upon me. I was 
no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, but 
I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for the 
ground I stood on shook three times at about eight 
minutes' distance, with three such shocks, as would 
have overturned the strongest building that could 
be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and a great 
piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half 
a mile from me next the sea, fell down with such a 
terrible noise, as I never heard in all my life. I per- 
ceived also the very sea was put into violent motion 
by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under 
the water than on the island. 

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having 
never felt the like, or discoursed with any one that 
liad, that I was like one dead or stupefied ; and the 
motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one 
that was tossed at sea. But the noise of the falling 
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me 
from the .stupefied condition I was in, filled me with 
hoiror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill 
falling upon my tent and all my household goods, 
and burying all at once , and this sunk my very soul 
within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more 
for some time, I began to take courage , and yet I 
had not heait enough to go over my wall again, for 
fear of being buried ah\e, but sat still upon the 

i jround, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not 
mowing what to do. All this while I had not the 
least serious religious thought, nothing but the com- 
mon, “ Uml, have mercy upon me ! ” and when it was 
over, that went away too. 

[ 89 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and 
grow cloud}', as if it would rain. Soon after that 
the wind rose by little and little, so that in less than 
half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. The 
sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and 
froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of the 
water , the trees were tom up by the I'oots , and a 
terrible storm it was: and thi.s held about three 
hours, and then began to abate ; and in two hours 
more it was stark calin, and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much 
terrified and dejected , when on a sudden it came into 
my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the 
conseciuences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself 
was spent and over, and I might ventin-e into niy cave 
again. With this thought my spints began to re- 
vive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I 
went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain was 
so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down 
with it, and I was forced to go into my cave, though 
very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fml 
on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to 
cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, 
to let the water go out, whuh would else have 
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave 
some time, and found still no more shocks of the 
earthquake follow, I licgan to be moi’e composed. 
And now to support ni> spirits, which indeed wanted 
it very much, I went to iiiy little stor«‘, and took a 
small sup of rum, which, howevei, I did then, and 
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no more 
when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night and great part of 
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad , but my 
mind being more composed, I began to think of what 
I had best do, concluding that if the island was sub- 
[ 90 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for 
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me some 
little hut in an open place, which I might surround 
with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself 
secure from wild beasts or men , but concluded, if I 
stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or 
other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent 
from the place where it stood, which was just under 
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it 
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my 
tept , and I spent the two next days, being the 19th 
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to 
remove my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that 
I never slept in quiet, and vet the apprehension of 
lying abroad without any feme was almost equal to 
it. But still, when 1 looked alxnit and saw how every- 
thing wa.s put in order, how pleasantly concealed I 
was, and how safe ft om danger, it made me very loth 
to remove. 

In the meantime it occurred to me that it would 
reijuire a vast deal of tune for me to do this, and that 
I must be contented to nin the venture where I was, 
till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured 
it so as to remove to it So with this resolution I com- 
posed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go 
to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles 
and cables, &c., in a cirele as before, and set mv tent 
up in it when it was finished, but that I would ven- 
ture to slay where I was till it was finished, and fit 
to remove to. This was the 21st. 

April 22. — The next morning I began to consider 
of means to put tins resolve in execution , but I was 
at a great loss about my tools. I bail three laigc 
axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much 
[91] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were 
all full of notches and dull , and though I had a 
grindstone, I could not' turn it and grind iny tools too. 
TTiis cost me as much thought as a statesman would 
have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a 
judge upon the life and death of a man. At length 
I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my 
foot, that I might have both iny hands at liberty. 
Note, I have never seen any such thing iii England, 
or at least not to take notic-e how it was done, though 
sinc'e I have observed it is very common there ; be- 
sides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. 
This machine cost me a full week’s woik to biiiig it 
to perfection. 

Ajml 28, 29 — These two whole days I took up 
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning inv 
grindstone performing very well 

April 30. — Having pci cei veil iny bread had been 
low a great while, now I took a suiToy of it, and re- 
duced" myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made 
my heart very heavy. 

May 1 — Tin the morning, looking tow'ards the 
seaside, the tide being low, I saw something lie on 
the shoi'e bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a 
cask. When I came to it, I found a small barrel, 
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, 
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; 
and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it 
seemed to lie higher out of the w’atcr than it .used to 
do. I examinra the liarrel which was driven on 
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder , 
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked 
as hard as a stone. However, I rolled it farther on 
shore for the present, and went on upon the sands as 
near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look for 
more. 

When I came down to the ship I found it 
L92] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


strangely removed. The forecastle, which lay before 
buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet ; and 
the stem, which was broken to pieces, and parted 
from the rest by the force of the sea soon after I 
had left mmmaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, 
and cast on one side, and the sand was thrown so 
high on that side next hei; stern, that whereas there 
was a great place of water before, so that I could 
not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck 
without swimming, I could now walk quite up to 
her when the tide was out. I was sumrised with 
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by 
the earthquake. And as by this violence the ship 
was more broken open than foi merly, so many things 
came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and 
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the 
land. 

ITiis wholly diverted my thoughts from the de- 
sign of removing my habitation ; and I busied 
myself mightily, that day especially, in searching 
whether I could make any way into the ship. But 
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for 
that all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. 
However, as I had learned not to despair of any- 
thing, I rosolied to pull everything to pieces that I 
could of the ship, concluding, that everything I could 
get from her w'ould be of some use or other to me. 

May 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece 
of a beam through, which I thought held some of 
the upper part or quarter-deck together ; and when 
I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well 
as I could from the side which lay highest ; but the 
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that 
time. 

May 4i. — I went a-fishing, but caught not one 
fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of niy sport ; 
when, just going to leave off, I caught a young* 
[93] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope- 
yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught 
fish enough, ns much as I cared to eat ; all which I 
dried in the sun, and eat them dry 
Mojj 5. — Worked on the wreck, cut another 
beam asunder, and bi ought thi'cc groat fir-planks 
off from the decks, whith I tied together, and made 
swim on shore, when the tide of Hood came on. 

May 6 — Worked on the wreck, got several iron 
bolts out of her, and other jnecc's of ironwork , 
worked very hard, and c.ainc home very much tired, 
and had thoughts of giving it over 

May 7. — tVciit to the wivck again, but with an 
intent not to work, hut found the weight of the 
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut, 
that several pieces of the ship seemed to he loose, 
and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could 
see into it, but almost full of water and sand. 

^ May 8. — Went to the wreck, and earned an mm 
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now' quite 
clear of the water oi sand. I wrenched open two 
planks, and hi-ought them on shore also with the 
tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next 
day 

May 9. -—Went to the wieck, and with the crow 
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt sev- 
eral casks, and loost^ned them with the trow, but 
could not break them up. I felt also the loll of 
English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy 
to remove. 

May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 — Went every day to the 
wreck, and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and 
boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weitrht of 
iron. 

May 15. — I rarried two hatchets to try if I could 
not cut a piece off of the roU of lead, by placing the 
4dge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other 
[94] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


but Eu it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I 
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. — It had bloweil hard in the night, and 
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the 
water , but I .stayed so long in the woods to get pig- 
eons for food, that the tide prevented me going to 
the wreck that day. 

May 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown 
on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off me, 
but resolved to see what they were, and found it was 
a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring 
away. 

May 24 — Eicry day to this day I worked on the 
wreck, and with h.ud laboui I loosened .some things 
so much w'ith the crow, that the first blowing tide 
several casks floated out, and tw'o of the seamen’s 
chests. But tlie wind blowing from the shore, noth- 
ing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and 
a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but* 
the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 16th of 
June, except the time necessary to get food, which 
I always appointed, during this part of my employ- 
ment, to lie when the tide was up, that I might be 
ready when it was eblxsl out And by this time I 
had gotten timber, and plank, and ironwork enough 
to have budded a good boat, if I had known how , 
and also, I got at .several times, and in several pieces, 
near one hundredweight of the sheet leail. 

Junf 16. — Going down to the seaside, I found a 
large tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had 
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not any 
defect of the place, or scarcity ; for had I happened 
to be on the other side of the island, I might have 
had hundreds of them every day, as I found after- 
wards ; but, perhap.s, had paid dear enough for them. 

June 17 I spent in cxioking the turtle. I found in

her threescore eggs , and he« flesh was to me, at that 
time, the most savoun and plea.sant that ever I tasted 
in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, 
since I landed in this homd place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I stayed within. 
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was 
something chilly, which I knew wa.s not usual in that 
latitude. 

JwM 19. — Very ill, and shivering, as if the 
weather had been cold. 

June 20. — No lest all night , violent pains in my 
head, and fevetish. 

June 21 — Vciy ill, frighted almost to death with 
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, 
and no help. I’rayed to God for the first time since 
the storm off of Hull, but scan* knew what I said, 
or why ; my thoughts being all confiiscd 

June 22. — A little better, but under dreadful 
apprehensions of sickneas. 

JuTte 23. — Very bad again , cold and shivering, 
and then a violent headai-lie. 

Jvme 24i. — Much better 

June 25. — An ague very violent , the fit held me 
seven houre , cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats 
after it. 

June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, 
took my gun, but found myself very weak. How- 
ever, I Killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty 
got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat. I 
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, 
but had no pot. 

Jwn^ 27. — The ague again so violent that I lay 
abed all day, and neither cat or drank. I was 
ready to perish for thirst , but so weak, I had not 
.strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to 
drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed ; 
and when I was not, I was so ignorant that T knew

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


not what to say ; only I lay and cried, “ Lord, look 
upon me ' Lora, pity me ' Lord, have mercy upon 
me ! ” I suppose I did nothing else for two or three 
hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did 
not wake till far in the night. When I waked, I 
found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceed- 
ing thirsty. However, as I had no water in my 
whole habitation, I was foit-ed to lie till morning, 
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had 
this terrible dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ^'ound, on the 
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew 
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend 
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and 
light upon the ground. He was all over as bnght as 
a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards 
him. His countenance was most inexpressibly dread- 
ful, impossible for words to describe. When he 
stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought 
the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the 
earthquake, and all the an looked, to my apprehen- 
sion, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he 
moved forwaixl towards me, with a long spear or 
weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he came 
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to 
me, or I heai-d a voice so terrible, that it is im- 
possible to express the terror of it. All that I can 
say I undemtood was this : “ Seeing all these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shtdt 
die ; ” at which words I thought he lifted up the 
s{)ear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will ex- 
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of 
my soul at this teirible vision ; I mean, that even 
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those 
horrors , nor is it any more possible to describe the 
you 1.-7 [ 97 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


impression that remained upon my mind when I 
awaked, and tound it was but a dream 

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had 
received by the good instruction of my father was 
then wom out, by an uninterrupted senes, for eight 
years, of seafaring wickedneas and a constant con- 
versation with nothing but such as wete, like myself, 
wicked and profane to the last degiee. I do not 
icmember that I had, in all that time, one thought 
that so much as tended either to looking upwards 
toward God, or iiiwai’ds towards a reflection upon 
my ways; but a certain stupidity of soul, without 
desire of good, or iiniscience of evil, had entirely 
ovei whelmed me, and I was all that the most 
hai^ened, unthinking, wicketl cieature among our 
common sailors can be sunjiftsinl to be , not having 
the least sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, 
or of thankfulness to Goil, in dehveranc'es. 

In the relating what is alieady past of iny story, 
this -will be the more easily believed, when I shall 
add, that through all the vanety of miseries that 
had to this day befallen me, I ncvci had so much as 
ont thought of it being the hand of GihI, or that it 
was a just punishment for my sin , inv rebellious 
behaviour against niy fiither, or my present sins, 
which were great , or so much as a punishment for 
the general coui-se of my wicked life When I was 
on the desperate expedition on the descit shores of 
Africa, I neier had so much as one thought of what 
would become of me ; or one vv ish to God to direct 
me whither I should go, or to keep me fiom the 
danger which apparently suiTounded me, as well 
from voracious creatures as cruel savages But I 
was merely thoughtless of a (iod or a I’rovidence , 
acted like a mere brute fioni the principles of Nature, 
and by the dictates of common sense unlv, and in- 
deed hardly that. 

[ 98 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When I wa* delivered and taken up at sea by the 
Portugal captain, well u«,ed, and dealt justly and 
honoumblv with, as well as. charitably, I had not the 
least thankfulness in roy thoughts. When again I 
was shipwreckwl, ruined, and in danger of drowning 
on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on 
it as a judgment, I only said to myself often, that I 
was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always 
miserable. 

It IS true, when I got on 'shore first here, and 
found all my ship’s crew drowned, and myself spared, 
I was surprised with a kind of ecsta-sy, and some 
transports of soul, which, had the giace of (iod 
assisteil, might have come up to true thankfulness ; 
but it ended where it begun, in a mere common 
flight of joy, or, as I may sav, being glad I was 
alive, without the least reflection upon the distin- 
guishing goodness of the hand which 'had preserved 
me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when 
all the rest were destroyed , or an inquiry why Piovi- 
dente had been thus inereiful to me; even just the 
same common sort of joy which seamen generally 
have after they aie got safe ashore from a ship- 
wreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of 
punch, and foiget almost as soon as it is ovei, and 
all the icst of my life w'as like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, 
iiiiule sensible of my condition, how I was cast on 
this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, 
out of all hope of rilief, or prospect of redemption, 
as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that 
I sliould not starve and perish for hunger, all the 
sense of mj a Hiclion wore off, and I began to be very 
easy, applied myself to the works proper for my 
preservation and supply, and was far enough from 
being afflicted at inj condition, as a judgment from 
heaven, or as the hand of God against me ; tliese 

[ 99 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

were thoughts which very seldom entered into my 
head. 

The growing up of the com, as is hinted in my 
journal, had at first some little influence upon me, 
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as I 
thought it had something miraculous in it , but as 
soon as ever that part of the thought was removed, 
all the impression which was raised fioni it wore off 
also, as I nave noted already. 

Even the earthcpiake, though nothing could be 
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately 
directing to the invisible Power, which alone directs 
such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, 
but the impression it had made went off* also. I had 
no more sense of God or His judgments, much less 
of the present affliction of inv circumstances being 
from His hand, than if I had been in the most pros- 
perous condition of life. 

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely 
view lof the misencs of death came to place itself be- 
fore me , when my .spirits began to sink under the 
burthen of a strong distemper, and Nature was ex- 
hausted with the violence of the fever , conscience, 
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began 
to reproach myself with niy past life, in which I had 
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, pmvoked the 
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, 
and to deal with me in so vindictive a inannci. 

These reflections oppressed me for the .second or 
thiivl day of my distemper ; and in the violence, as 
well of the fever as of the di'eadful reproaches of my 
conscience, extorted .some words from me, like pray- 
ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a 
prayer attended with desires or with hopes ; it was 
rather the voice of mere fnght and distress. My 
thoughts were confused, tlie convictions great upon 
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miser- 
[ 100 ]‘ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


able condition, raised vapours into my head with the 
mere apprehensions ; and in these hurnes of my soul, 
I know not what my tongue might express , but it 
was rather exclamation, such as, “ Lord ! what a 
miserable creature am I ! If I should be sick, I shall 
certainly die for want of help , and what will become 
of me ? ” Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and 
I could sa^ no more for a Mod while. 

In this interval, the good advice of my father came 
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I 
mentioned at the beginning of this story, viz., that 
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless 
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon 
having neglected his counsel, when there might be 
none to assist in my recovery. “ Now,” said I aloud, 
“ iny dear father’s words are come to pass ; God’s 
justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or 
hear me. I reja-ted the voice of Providence, which 
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life 
wherein I might have been happy and easy ; but I 
would neither see it myself, or learn to know the 
blessings of it from niy parents I left them to mourn 
over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the 
consequences of it. I refused their help and assist- 
ance, who would have lifted me into the world, and 
would have made everything easy to me ; and now I 
have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even 
Nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, 
no comfort, no advice.” Then I cned out, “ Lord, 
be my help, for I am in great distmss.” 

This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that 
I had made for many years. But I return to my 
journal. 

June 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed wdth 
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I 
got up , and though the fright and terror of my 
dream was very gi’eat, yet I considered that the fit

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of the ague would return again the next day, and 
now was my time to get something to refresh and 
support myself when I should be ill And the first 
thing I did I filled a large scjuare caso-bottlc with 
water, and set it upon my table, in leach of my bed, 
and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the 
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, 
and mixed them together. Tlien I got me a piece 
of the goat’s H&sh, and bi oiled it on the coals, but 
could eat very little I walked about, but was very 
weak, and withal very sad and heavy-heaited in the 
sense of my miserable condition, (heading the letiirn 
of iny disteinpei the next day At night I made my 
supper of three of the tui tie’s eggs, which I roasted 
ill the ashes, and eat, ns we call it, in the shell, and 
this was the fii’st bit of meat I had ever asked fxod's 
blessing to, even as I could remember, in my whole 
life. 

After I Viad eaten, I tried to walk, but found my- 
self so weak, that I could hardly cairy the gun (foi I 
never went out without that) , so I went but a little 
way, and sat.down upon the ground, looking out upon 
the sea, which was just before me, and vei y calm and 
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these 
occurred to me. 

What is this earth and .sea, of wdiich I ha\e seen 
so much ? whence is it pi educed And what am I, 
and all the other creatures, wild and taiiic, hiiinan 
and brutal, whence are we ? Sine we aie all made 
by some secret Power, who formed the eai th and sea, 
the air and sky. And who is that ? 

Then it followed most naturally. It is God that has 
made it all. Well, but then it came on strangely, 
if God has made all these things. He guides and 
governs them all, and all things that concern them , 
for the Power that could make all things, must 
certainly have power to guide and direct them. 

[ 102 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of 
His works, eitlier without IIis knowledge or appoint- 
ment. And if nothing happens without His knowl- 
edge, He knows that I am here, and am in this 
dreadful condition. And if nothing happens without 
His appointment. He has appointed all this to befall 
me. 

Nothing occuired to my thoughts to contradict 
any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested 
upon me, with the greater foice, that it must needs 
he that God had appointed all this to befall me ; 
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance 
by His diiection. He having the sole power, not 
of me onlv, but of everything that happened in 
the woild Iiiiniedintely it' followed. Why has God 
done this to me ** What have I done to be thus 
used '' 

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, 
as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to 
me like a voice “ Wretch ' dost tlioii ask what thou 
hast done Ijook back upon a dreadful misspent 
life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? Ask, 
why IS it that thou wert not long ago destroyed 
Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roods ; 
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the 
Sallee man-of-war , devoui’cd “by the wild beasts on 
the coast of Africa , or drowned here, when all the 
crew perished but thyself ? Dost thou ask, What 
have I done ? ” 

I was struck dumb wdth these reflections, as one 
astonished, and hod not a word to say, no, not to 
answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked 
back to iny retreat, and went up ovei my wall, as if 
I had been going to bed. But my thoughts were 
sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; 
so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for 
it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of 
[ 103 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the return of my distemper terrified me very much, 
it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take 
no physic but their toba!^ for almost all distempers ; 
ana I had a piect* of a roll of tobwco in one of the 
chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was 
green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt , for in this 
chest I found a cure both for soul and bod). I 
opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz., 
the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay 
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I men- 
tioned before, and which to this tune I had not toLiiid 
leisure, <3r so much as inclination, to look into. I 
say, I took it out, and brought both that and the 
touacco with me to the'table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as 
to my distemper, or whether it was good foi it or no , 
but I tiled several exjienments with it, as if I was 
resolved it should hit one way or other I first took 
a piece of a leafi and chew’cd it in my mouth, which 
indeed at first almost stujiefied my brain, the tobacco 
being green and strong, and that I had not been much 
used to it. Then I took some and steeped it an houi 
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of 
it when I lay down. And lastly, I burnt some upon 
a pan of coals, and heI9 my nose close over the smoke 
of it as long as I could bear it, os well for the heat, 
as almost for suffocation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the 
Bible, and began to read, but my head w'as too much 
disturbed witli the tobacco to Ixiar reading, at least 
that time ; only having opened the book casually, the 
first words that occurrM to me were these, “ Call on 
Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver, aii'd thou 
shalt glorify Me.” 

The woids were very apt to my case, and made 
some impression upon iny thoughts at the time of 
[ 104 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


reading them, though not so much as they did after- 
wards ; for as for t«ing delivered, the word had no 
sound, as I may say, to me, the thing was so remote, 
so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I 
began to say, as the children of Israel did when they 
were promised flesh to eat, “ Can God spread a table 
in the wilderness ? ” so I b^an to say. Can God Him- 
self deliver me from this place. And as it was not for 
many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed 
very often upon ray thoughts. But, however, the 
words made a great impression upon me, and I mused 
upon them very often. 

It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, 
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep ; so 
I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should 
want anything in the night, and went to bed. But 
before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all 
my life , I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fill- 
til the promise to me, that if 1 called upon Him in 
the day of trouble. He would deliver me. After my 
broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the 
rum in which I had steeped the tobacco , which was 
so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could 
scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went 
to bed. I found presently it flew up in iny head 
violently , but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked 
no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near 
three o’clock in the afternoon the next day. Nay, 
to this hour I am partly of the opinion that I slept 
all the next day and night, and till almost three that 
day after , for othera ise I knew not how I should lose 
a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, 
os it appeared some years after I had done. Foi if 
I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line, I 
should have lost more than one day. But certainly 
I lost a day in my account, and never knew which 
way. 

[ 105 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Be that, however, one wav or the other, when I 
awaked I found invself exceedingly refreshed, and 
iny spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I 
was stronger than I wa.s the day befoiv, and my 
stomach Ix'tter, for I was hungry , and, in short, I 
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered 
for the better. This w as the 29tb. 

The 30tli was iny well day, of course, and I went 
abioad with my gun, but did not care to tiavel too 
far. I killed a sea-fowl oi two, something like a 
brand-g(Mise, and brought them home, but was not 
\ery forwaid to eat them , so I eat some inoio of fhe 
turtle’s eggs, which were very good. This csciiing I 
renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me 
good the day liefore, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum ; 
only I did not take so much as befoi’c,noi did I cliew 
any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. 
However, I was not so well the next day, which was 
the first of July, as I hoped I should have been , for 
I had- a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not 
much 

July 2. — I renew ed the medicine all the thice 
ways ; and dosed myself with it as at first, and 
doubled the ijuantity which I drank 

July 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though 
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks 
after. While 1 was thus gathering strength, my 
thoughts lan exceedingly upon this Sciiptuie, “I 
will deliver thee,” and the impossibility of niy de- 
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever 
expecting it. But as I was discouraging myself with 
such thoughts, it occuned to my mind that I poied 
so much upon my dehvemnee from the main afflic- 
tion, that I disiegarded the deliveiance I had re- 
ceived , and I was, as it were, made to ask myself 
such questions as these, vi/. Have I not been deliv- 
ered, and wonderfully too, from sickness ? from the 
[106] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


most distressed condition that could be, and that 
was so frightful to me ? and what notice had I taken 
of it? Had I done my part? God had delivered 
me, but I had not glorified Him , that is to say, I 
had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliv- 
erance , and how could I expect greater deliverance ' 

This touched my heart veiy much , and immetli- 
ately I kneeled dow n, and gave God thanks aloud 
for my recovery fioin my sickness. 

July 4. — 111 the morning I took the Bible ; and 
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously 
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile 
every morning and every night, not tying myself to 
the number of chapteiN, but as long as my thoughts 
should engage me It was not long after I set .seri- 
ouslv to this work, but 1 found mv heart more deeply 
and sinceiely affected with the uickedness of my past 
life. The impression of mv dream revived, and the 
vvoids, “All these things have not brought thee to 
repentance,” ran sciiously in my thought. I was 
caniestly begging of God to give me repentance, 
when it happened providentially, the vciyday, that, 
reading the Sciiptuie, I came to these viouis, “He 
IS exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give lepent- 
aiice, and to give remission” I threw down the 
hook , and with my heart as well as my hands lifted 
up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out 
aloud, “ Jesus, Thou son of David ' .Jesus, Thou 
exalted Prince and Saviour, giv e me repentance ' ” 

This was the firet tune that I could say, in the 
true sense of the woitls, that I prayed in all my life, 
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and 
with a tiue Scripture view of hope founded on the 
encouragement of the Word of God, and from this 
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God 
would hear me. 

Now I liegan to construe the words mentioned 
[107] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


above, “Call on Me, and I will deli\er you,” in a 
different sense from what I had ever done liefore ; 
for then I had no notion of anything being called 
deliverance but my being delivers from the captiv- 
ity I was in ; for though I was indeed at large in the 
place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, 
and that in the worst sense in the world But now 
I learned to take it in another sense , now I looked 
back upon my past life with such horror, and my 
sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought noth- 
ing of Gwl but dehveiance fiom the load of guilt 
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary 
life, it was nothing . I did not so much as piay to 
be delivered from it, or think ot it , it was all of no 
consideration, in comparison to this. And I add 
this part here, to hint to whoever .shall read it, that 
whenever they come to a tiue sense of things, they 
will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing 
than deliverance from affliction. 

But leaving this part, I leturn to my journal 

My condition began now to be, though not less 
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to 
my initid ; and my thoughts being diracted, by a 
con.stant reading the Senpture, and praying to God, 
to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of 
comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of. 
Also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred 
myself to fuinish myself with everything that I 
wanted, and make my way of living as regular as 
I could. 

Fiom the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in w'alkmg about with my gun in my 
hand, a little and a little at a time, ns a man that 
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness ; 
for it is hardly to be imagined how low' I was, and 
to what weakness I was leduced. The application 
which I made use of wa.s perfectly new, and perhaps 
[108] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


■what had never cured an ague before ; neither can I 
recommend it to any one to practise, by this experi- 
ment, and though it did carry off the fit, yet it 
rather contributed to weakening me ; for I had fre- 
quent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some 
time. 

I learnt from it also this, in particular, that being 
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious 
thing to my health that could be, especially in those 
rains which came attended with storms and hurri- 
canes of wind, for as the lain which came in the 
dry season w'as always most accompanied with such 
storms, so I found that ram was much more danger- 
ous than the rain which fell in September and 
October. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten 
months , all possibility of deliverance from this con- 
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me ; and I 
firmly lielievcd that no human shape had ever set 
foot upon that place. Having now secured my hab- 
itation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great 
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, 
and to see ivhat other productions I might find, which 
I yet knew nothing of. 

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a 
more particular .survey of the i.sland itself. I went 
up the <Teek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my 
rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two 
miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and 
that it was no more than a little brook of running 
water, and very fiesh and good, but this being the 
dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts 
of it, at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as 
it could be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant 
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered 
with grass , and on the rising parts of them, next 
[109] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be 
supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of 
tobaPTO, green, and growing to a great and very 
stixnig stalk Theie were divers other plants, vs Inch 
I had no notion of, or undeistanding about, and 
might perhaps have viitues of then own, which I 
could not lind out. 

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, 
in all that climate, make their biead of, but I could 
find none. I saw laige plants of aloes, but did not 
tlieii understand them. I saw seveial sugar-canes, 
hut wild, and. for want of cultivation, impel feet. I 
contented myself with these discoveries foi this 
time, and came baik, musing with nivself what 
course I might take to know the virtue and goodness 
of any of the fruits or plants whicli I should dis- 
covet , but could bung it to no conclusion, for, in 
shoit, I had made so little observation while I was 
in the Brazils, that 1 knew little of the plants in the 
field, at least very little that might serve me to any 
purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way 
again , and aftei going something ffiilher than I had 
gone the day before, I fouiiii the biook and the 
savannas began to cense, and the country became 
more woody than before In this pnit I found dif- 
ferent fiuits, and paiticularly I found melons upon 
the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the 
trees. The vines had spiead indeed over the trees, 
and the clusteis of grapes were just now in their 
prime, veiy ripe and iich This was a surpnsing 
discovery, and I was ext ceding glad of them, but 
I w'as warned by my' experience to eat sparingly 
of them, reiiiembenng that when I was ashore in 
Barbary the eating of giapes killed several of our 
Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing 
them into fiuxes and fevei's. But I found ai'i excel- 
[ 110 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


lent u»e for these grapes ; and that was, to cure or 
dry them lu the sun, and keep them as dried giapes 
or raisins are kept, which I thought would be. as 
indeed they were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat, 
when no grapes might be to be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back 
to iny habitation ; which, by the way, was the first 
night, as I might say, 1 had lain fioiii home. In 
the night, I took my fii-st contrivance, and got up 
into a tico, where I slept well , and the next morn- 
ing proceeded upon iny discovery, travelling near 
four milo.s, as I might judge by the length of the 
valley, keeping still due north, w ith a ridge of hills 
on the south and north side of me 

At the end of this inarc-h I came to an opening, 
where the country seemed to descend to the west, 
and a little spring of flesh water, which issued out 
of the side of the hill bv me, ran the other wav, that 
IS, due east, and the country appeared so fresh, so 
green, so flounshing, cnerythiiig oeing in a constant 
verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a 
planted gaidcn. 

I desc-eiided a little on the side of that delicious 
vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure, 
though mixed with my othei afflicting Lnoughts, to 
think that this was all my own , that I was king and 
loid of nil this country indefeasibly, and had a right 
of possession , and, if I could tonx'ey it, I might have 
it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor 
111 England. I saw here abundance of ccx'oa trees, 
orange, and lemon, and citron trees , but all wild, 
and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then. 
However, the green limes that I gathered were not 
only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I 
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made 
it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough to gather and 

riiii 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


carry home , and I resolved to lay up a store, as well 
of grapes as limes and lemons to furnish myself for 
the wet season, which I knew was approaching. 

In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes 
in one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and 
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place ; 
and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag 
or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest 
home. 

Accordingly, having s^ient thiee days in this 
journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent 
and my cave) ; but before I got thither, the grapes 
were spoiled , the richness of the fruits, and the 
weight of the juice, having bmken them and bruised 
them, they were gowl for little or nothing as to the 
limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, hav- 
ing made me two small bags to bung home my 
harvest ; but I was surprised, when, coming to my 
heap of grapes, which were so lich and tine when I 
gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod 
to pieces, and dragged alxiut, some here, some tlicie, 
ana abundance eaten and devoured By this I con- 
cluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts, 
which had done this , but what they weie, I knew 
not. 

However, as I found that there w'as no laying 
them up on heaps, and no carrying them aw'ay in a 
sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, 
and the other way they would he crushed with their 
own weight, I took anothei coui>e , for 1 gathered a 
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them up 
upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might 
cure and dry in the sun , and .as for the limes and 
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand 
under 

[112 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

When I came home fi-om this journey, 1 con- 
templated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that 
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation ; the 
security from storms on that side the water and the 
wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon a 
place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst 
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to con- 
sider of removing my habitation, and to look out for 
a place equally safe as where I now was situate, if 
pos.sible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was 
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness 
of the place tempting me; but when I came to a 
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now by 
the seaside, where it was at least possible that some- 
thing might happen to my advantage, and, by the 
same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring 
some other unhappy wretches to the same place, and 
though it was scarce probable that any such thing 
should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the 
hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to 
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair 
not only improbable, but impos.sible; and that there- 
fore I ought not by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that 
I spent much of my time there for the whole remain- 
ing part of the month of July; and though, upon 
second thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove, 
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and sur- 
rounded it at a distance with a .strong fence, being a 
double hedge as high as I could reach, well staked, 
and filled between with brushwood. And here I 
lay very secure, sometimes two or thi’ee nights to- 
gether, always going over it with a ladder, as before , 
so that I fancied now I had my country house and 
my seacoast hou.se, and this work took me up to 
the beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began 
to enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and 
made me stick close to my first habitation , for 
though I had made me a tent like the other, with 
a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had 
not the shelter of a hill to keep me fiom storms, nor 
a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were 
extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had 
finished my bower, and began to eiijov myself. The 
8nl of August, I found the grapes I had hung up 
were jicrfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good 
raisins of the sun . so I lK>gan to take them down 
from the trees. And it was veiy happy that I did 
so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled 
them, and I had lost the liest pait of my winter 
foixl , for I had alxivo two hundred large bunches 
of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, 
and carried most of them home to niv cave, but it 
began to ram , and from hence, which was the 14th 
of August, it rained, more or less, eveiy day till the 
middle^ of October, and sometimes so violently, that 
I could not stir out of my cave for seveial da\s. 

In this season, I was mucli suipriscd with the in- 
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the 
loss of one of my cats, who run away fiom me, or, as 
I thought, had been dc.ad, and I heaid no inoix* tale 
or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she came 
home about the end of August with thiee kittens 
This was the more stiange to me, because, though 
I had killed a wild cat, as I callcsl it, vvith my gun, 
yet I thought it w.as a quite ditfeient kind fiom our 
Eunipean cats, vet the young cats were the same 
kind of house-breed like the old one , and both my 
cats being females, I thonglit it very strange. But 
from these three cats I afteiwaids came to be so 
pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them 
[ 114 ]

like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from 
my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant 
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care- 
ful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I be- 
gan to be straitened for food ; but venturing out 
twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, 
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, 
which was a ti-eat to me, and my food was regulated 
thus : I eat a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a 
piec'e of the goat’s flesh, or of the turtle, for my 
dinner, broiled , for, to niy gi'eat misfortune, I had 
no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and two or three 
of the turtle’s eggs for niy su[>per. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, 
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my 
cave, and by degrees worked it on towaifls one side, 
till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a 
door, or way out, which came beyond inv fence or 
wall , and so I came in and out this way. But I was 
not perfectly easy at lying so open ; for as I had 
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure , 
whereas now, I thought I lay exposed, and open for 
anything to come in upon me, and yet I could not 

f jcrceive that there was any living thing to feai, the 
iiggest creature that I haci yet seen upon the island 
being a goat. 

Sept. 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anni- 
versary of my landing. I cast up the notches on 
my post, and found I had been on shore three hun- 
dred and sixty-five days 1 kept this day as a 
solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exercise, 
prostrating myself on the ground with the most 
serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, 
acknowledging His righteous judgments upon me, 
and praying to Him to have mercy on me through 
Jesus Christ ; and having not tasted the least re-

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


freshment for twelve hours, even till the going down 
of the sun, I then eat a biscuit -cake and a bunch of 
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as 1 be- 
gan it. 

I had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for 
as at fimt I had no sense of religion upon my mind, 
I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the 
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for 
the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any 
of the days were. But now, having cast up the davs, 
os above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided 
it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a 
Sabbath ; though I found at the end of iiiy account, 
I had lost a day or two in my i-cckoning. 

A little after this iny ink began to fail me, and 
so I contented myself to u.se it inoie sparingly, and 
to wnte down only the most remarkable events of 
my life, without cuntinuing a daily memorandum of 
other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now 
to appear regulai to me, and I learned to divide 
them so as to provide for them accordingly ; but I 
bought <al] my experience before I had it, and this 
I am going to relate was one of the most discourag- 
ing experiments that I made at all. I have men- 
tioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and 
rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, 
as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were 
about thirty stalks of nee, and about twenty of 
barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to sow 
it after the rains, the sun being in its southern 
position, going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well 
as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it 
into two parts, I sowed iny grain , hut os I was sow- 
ing, it casually occuiTcd to my thoughts that I would 
not sow it all at first, because 1 did not know when was 

[ 116 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds 
of the seed, leaving about a handful of each. 

It was a great comfort to me afterwaids that I 
did so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time 
came to anything, for the dry months following, the 
earth having had no ram after the seed was sown, it 
had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came 
up at all till the wet season had come again, and then 
it grew as if it had been but newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily 
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister 
piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug 
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed 
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the 
vernal eauinox. And this having the rainy months 
of March and April to water it, sprung up very 
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but hav- 
ing part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow 
all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, 
my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck 
of each kind. But by this experiment I was made 
master of my business, and knew exactly when the 
proper season was to sow, and that I might expect 
two seed-times and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little dis- 
covery, w'hich was of use to me afterwards. As 
soon as the rains were over, and the weather began 
to settle, which was about the month of November, 
I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, 
though I had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double 
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, 
but the stakes which I had ait out of some trees 
that grew themibouts were all shot out, and giuwn 
with long branches, a.s much aa a willow-tree usually 
shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could 
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were 


[ 117 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


cut from. I wa!5 .surprised, and yet very well pleased 
to see the young trees grow, and I pruned them, 
and led them up to glow as much alike as I could. 
And it IS scaife credible how lieautiful a figure they 
grew into in three jears, so that though the hedge 
made ii circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, 
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon 
covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient 
to lodge under all the dry season 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, 
and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round 
my wall (I mean that of my fiist dwelling), which I 
did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, 
at about eight yards distance from my first fence, 
they grew presently, and were at fiist a fine cover to 
my habitation, and afterwarrl served for a defence 
also, as I shall obseive in its ordei 

I found now that the seasons of the year might 
generally be disidcd, not into summer and wintei, 
as ill Europe, but into the laiiiy seasons and the dry

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter 
as the winds happened to blow, but this was the 
general observation I made. After I had found by 
experience the ill consequence of being abroad in the 
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions 
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out ; 
and I sat within doors as much as possible during 
the wet months. 

In this time I found much employment, and \ery 
suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion 
of many things which I had no way to furnish my- 
self with but by hard labour and constant applica- 
tion , particularly, I tried many ways to make myself 
a basket ; but all the twigs I could get for the pur- 
pose proveil so brittle, that they would do nothing. 
It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that 
when I was a boy I used to take great delight in 
standing at a basket- maker’s in the town where my 
father hved, to see them make tlieir wieker-ware; 
and being, as boys usually aie, very officious to help, 
and a great oliserver of the manner how they w orketl 
those riiings, and sometiiiics lending a hand, I had 
by this means full knowledge of the methods of it, 
that I wanted nothing but the matenals ; when it 
came into iny innid that the tw igs of that tree from 
whence I cut iiiy stakes that grew might possibly be 
as tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers in 
England, and I resolved to try. 

Aceordingly, the next day, I went to my country 
house, as I called it ; and cutting some of the smaller 
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I 
could desire , whcreujxm I came the next time pre- 
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 
I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. 
These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and 
when they were fit for use, I carried them to my 
cave ; and here during the next season I employed 
[ 119 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


myself in making, as well as I could, a great many 
baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up 
anything as I had occasion. And though I dm nut 
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suffi- 
ciently servic^ble for my purpose. And thus, af- 
terwards, I took care never to be without them, ; and 
as iny wicker-ware decayed, I made more, especially 
I made strong deep baskets to place my com in, in- 
stead of sacks, when 1 should come to have any 
quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if 
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no ves- 
sels to hold anything that was liquid, except two 
runlets, which were almost full of mm, and some glass 
bottles, some of the common size, and others which 
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters, 
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any- 
thing, except a great kettle, which I saved out of 
the ship. Olid which wa.s too big for such use as 1 
desired it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of 
meat by itself. Tlie second thing I would fain have 
had was a tobacco-pipe , but it was impossible to me 
to make one. However, I found a. contrivance for 
that, too, at la.st. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows of 
stalks or piles and in this wicker-working all the 
summer or dry season, when another business took 
me up more tune than it could be imagined I could 
spare. 

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to 
see the whole island, and that I had tiavelled up the 
brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and 
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the 
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel 
quite across to the seashore on that side , so taking 
iny gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity 

L 120 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit- 
cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for 
ray store, I began my journey. When I had passed 
the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came 
within view of the sea to the west ; and it being a 
very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an 
island or a continent I could not tell ; but it lay 
very high, extending from the west to the W. S. W. 
at a very great distance ; by my guess, it could not 
''be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might 
be, otherwise than that I know it must be part of 
America, and, as I concluded, by all my observations, 
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps 
was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have 
landed, I had liecn in a worse condition than I was 
now ; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions 
of Providence, which I began now to own and to 
believe onlered everything for the best. I say, I 
quieted iny mind with this left afflicting myself 
with fruitless wishes of being there. 

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con- 
sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I 
should certainly, one time or other, see some vessel 
pass or repass one way or other , but if not, then it 
was the savage coast between the Spanish country 
and Brazils, which are indeed the-worst of savages ; 
for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to 
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall 
into their hands. 

With these considerations I walked very leisurely 
forward I found that side of the island, where I 
now was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or 
savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, 
and full of veiy fine woods. 

I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have 
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, 
[ 121 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and tauffht it to speak to me. I did, after some 
painstaking, catch a voung parrot, for I knocked it 
down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought 
it home; but it was some years lx*foie I could make 
him speak. However, at la.st I taught him to call 
me by my name very famiharl}'. But the accident 
that followetl, though it be a trifle, will be very 
diverting m its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I 
found in the low grounds hare.s, as I thought them 
to be, and foxes ; but they differod greatly from all 
the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy 
myself to eat them, though I killed several But I 
had no need to be venturous, for I hail no want of 
food, and of that which was very good too , espe- 
cially these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and 
turtle, or tortoise , which, luldcd to my grape.s, Lead- 
enhall Market could not Have furniiJied a table 
better than I, in proportion to the c(*mpany And 
though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had 
gi'oat cause for thankfulness, and that t was not 
driven to any extrenuties foi food, but lather plenty, 
even to dainties. 

I never travcllcKl in this journey alxivp two miles 
outright in a dav , or thereabouts ; but I took so 
many turns and returns to see what discoveries I 
could make, that I came weary enough to the place 
where I resolved to sit down foi all night, and then 
I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded my- 
self with a lyjw of stakes, set upnght in the ground, 
either from one tree to another, oi so as no wild 
creature could come at me without waking me. 

As scxm as I came to the seashore, I was suiprised 
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side 
of the island, for here indeed the shore was covered 
with innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other side, 

I had found but three in a year and a half. Here 



ROBINSON CRUSOE ' 

was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, 
some which I ha /1 seen, and some which I had not 
seen of before, and many of them very good meat, 
but such as I knew not the names of, except those 
called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was 

S sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore 
more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which 
I could better feed on ; and though there were many 
goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it 
was with much more difficulty that I could come 
near them, the country being fiat and even, and they 
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleas- 
anter than iiiiiie; but yet I had not the least incli- 
nation to remove, for as I was fixed in my habitation, 
it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while 
I was here to he as it were upon a journey, and from 
home. However, I travellea along the snore of the 
sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, 
and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for 
a mark, I concluded I would go home again ; and 
that the next journey I took should be on the other 
side of the island, cast from my dwelling, and so 
round till I came to my post again , of which in its 
place. 

I took another way to come back than that I 
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so 
much 111 my view, that I could not miss finding my 
first dwelling by viewing the country. But I found 
myself mistaken ; for being come about two or three 
miles, I found myself descended into a very large 
valley, but .so surrounded with hills, and those hills 
covered with wood, that I could not see which was 
my way by any direction but that of the son, nor 
even then, unless I knew very well the position of 
the sun at that tune of the day. 

[ 1*31 ' 



ROBINSON CRTTSOE 


It happened to my farther misfortune, that the 
weather proved hazy for three or four days while I 
was in this valley , and not being able to see the sun, 
I Wandered about very unoonifbrtably, and at last was 
oblig<‘d to find out the seaside, look for my post, and 
eome back the same way I went ; and then by easy 
journeys I turned homeward, the weather being ex- 
ceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and 
other things very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a voung kid, and 
seized upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, 
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a 
great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often 
been musing whether it might not be possible to get 
a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, 
which might sup[)ly me when my powder and shot 
should be all sjicnt 

I made a collar to this little creature, and with a 
string, which I made of some rope-yam, which I al- 
ways earned about me, I led him along, though with 
some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I 
enclosed him and left him, for 1 was very iiiijiatient 
to be at home, from whence I had been absent above 
a inorith 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to 
come into my old hutch, and he down in my ham- 
mock-bed. This litth wandering journey, without 
settled filace of abode, had Ixien so unpleasant to me, 
that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a 
perfect settlement tome mm pared to t\iat, and it 
rendered everything almut me so conifbi’table, that I 
resolved I w'ould never go a great way fiom it again, 
while it should lx* my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale 
myself after my long journey , during which most of 
the time was taken up in the weighty affair of ninkiTig 
a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. 
Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had 
penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go 
and fetch it home, or give it some food. Accordingly 
I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it 
could not get out, but almost starved for want of 
food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches 
of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, 
and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it 
away ; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I 
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a 
dog And as I c-ontinually fed it, the cix-ature became 
so loving, so gentle, and so fond, tViat it became from 
that time one of my domestics also, and would never 
leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now 
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same 
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of my 
landing on the island, having now been there two 
yeara, and no more prospect of being delivered than 
the first day I came there I spent the whole day in 
humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many 
•wonderful mercies which my solitai’y condition was 
attended with, and without which it might have been 
infinitely more miserable I gave humble and hearty 
thanks that Grod had been pleased to discover to me 
even that it was possible I might be more happy in this 
solitary condition, than I should have been m a lib- 
erty of society, and in all the pleasui'es of the w orld ; 
that He could fully make up to me the deficiencies of 
my solitary state, and the want of human society, by 
His presence, and the communications of His giace 
to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging 
me to depend upon His providence here, and hope 
for His eternal pi-esence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much 
more happy this life I now led was, with all its 

[1251 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, 
alwminable life I led all the past part of my days. 
And now I changed both my sorrows and my joys ; 
my very desires altered, my affections changm their 
gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what 
they were at iiiy fii>>t coming, or indeed for the two 
years past. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my bunting, 
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul 
at my condition would break out upon me on a 
sudden, and my very heart would die wuthin me, to 
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was 
in, and how 1 was a piisonei, locked up with the 
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited 
wilderness, without redemption In the midst of 
the greatest composures of my mind, this would 
break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring 
iny hands, and weep like a child Sometimes it 
w'ould take me in the middle of my work, and I 
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon 
the ground for an houi or two together , and this 
w'as still worse to me, for if I could burst out into 
tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off, and* 
the giief, having exhausted itself, would aliate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new 
thoughts I daily read the Wore! of God, and 
applied all the comforts of it to my present state. 
One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible 
upon these w oids, “ I will never, never leave thee, 
nor forsake thee.” Immediately it otrurred that 
these words were to me , why else should they be 
directed in such a manner, just at the moment when 
I was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken 
of God and man ? “ Well then,” said I, “ if God 
does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it 
be, or w'hat matters it, though the world should all 
forsake me, seeing on the other hand if I hod all 
[ 126 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the world, and should lose the favour and blessing 
of G^jd, there would be no comparison in the loss ?” 

From this moment I began to conclude in iny 
mind that it was possible for me to be more hapm- 
in this forsaken solitar^r condition, than it was proliH 
able I should ever have been in any other particular 
state in the world, and with this thought I was going 
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. 

I know not what it was, but something shocked 
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the 
words. “How canst thou be such a hypocrite,” 
said I, even audibly, “ to pretend to be thankful for 
a condition which, however thou inayest endeavour 
to be contented with, thou wouldest rather pray 
heartily to be delivered from Sol stopped there ; 
but though I could not say I thanked Gml for being 
there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for open- 
ing my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to 
see the former condition of my life, and to mourn 
for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the 
Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed 
God foi directing my friend in England, without any 
order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and 
for a.ssisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck 
of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mine, I began my 
third >ear , and though I have not given the reader 
the trouble of so particular account of ray works this 
year as the first, yet in general it may be observed, 
that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly 
divided my time, according to the several daily 
employments that were before me, such as, first, my 
duty to God, and the lading the Scriptures, which 
I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every 
day , secondly, the going abroad with my gun for 
food, which generally took me up three hours in 
every morning, when it did not rain ; thirdly, the 
[ 127 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking ^^hat I had 
killed or catched for my supply , these took up great 
part of the day , also, it is to be considered that the 
middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, 
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out ; so 
that about four hoiii> in the evening was all the time 
I could be supposed to work in, with this exception, 
that sometimes I changed my horn's of hunting and 
working, and went to work in the morning, and 
abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short tiihe alloweil for labour, I desire 
may be added the exceeding laboiiousness of my 
work , the many hours which, for want of tools, 
want of help, and want of skill, everything I did 
took up out of my time For example, I was full 
two and forty days making me a boaid for a long 
shelf, which I wanted in my cave, whereas two 
sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have 
cut. six of them out of the same tree in half a 
day. 

My ca.se was this it was to be a large tree which 
was to be cut down, Ix^cause my board was to be a 
broad one. This tree I was three days a-cutting 
down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and 
inducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With in- 
expressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the 
side.s of it into chips till it begun to lx; light enough 
to moyc ; then I turned it, and made one side of it 
smooth and flat as a lioard from end to end , then 
turning that side downward, cut the other side, tiU 
I brought the plank to be about thret* inches thick, 
and smooth on b<ith sides. Any one may judge 
the labour of my hands in such a piece of work , but 
labour and patience camed me through that, and 
many other things. I only observe this in particu- 
lar, to show the reason why so much of my time 
went away with so little work, viz , that what might

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast 
labour, and re<]uii'e<l a prodigious time to do alone, 
and by hand. But notwithstanding this, with 
patience and labour, I went through many things, 
and, indeed, everything that my circumstances metde 
necessary to me to do, as will appear by what 
follows. 

I was now, in the months of November and 
December, expecting my crop of barley and nee. 
"^nic ground I had manured or dug up for them was 
not great ; for as I observed, my seed of each was 
not above the quantity of half a peck , for I had 
lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season. 
But now my crop promised very well, when on a 
sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again 
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce pos- 
sible to keep from it , a.s, first the goats and wild 
creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the 
swectnc.ss of the blade, lay in it night and day, as 
soon as it came up, and eat it so clase, that it could 
get no tune to shoot up into stalk. 

This I saw no rcnnxly for but by making an en- 
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a 
great deal of toil, and the more, because it retpiired 
speed. However, as my arable land was but small, 
suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in 
about three weeks’ time, and sluKiting some of the 
creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it 
in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, 
where he would stand ana bark all night long; so 
in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and 
the corn grew very strong and well, and began to 
npen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before while my corn 
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin 
me now when it was in the eu* ; for going along by 
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop 
voi- 1 . — 9 [ 129 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many 
sorts, who st(K)d, as it were, watching till I should 
be gone I irii mediately let fly among them, for I 
always had my gun with me I had no sooner shot, 
but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I 
had not seen at all, from among the corn itself. 

This touched me seiisiblv, for I foresaw that in 
a few days they would devour all iny hopes, that I 
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop 
at nil, and what to do I could not tell. However, 
I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I 
should w'atch it night and day. In the first place, 
I went among it to .sec what damage was already 
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of 
it , but that as it was yet too green for them, the 
loss was not so great but that the remainder was 
like to be a good crop if it could be saved. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all 
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was 
gone away. And the event proved it to be so , for 
as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out 
of their sight but they dropped down, one by one, 
into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could 
not have patience to stay till moie came on, know- 
ing that every grain that they eat now was, as it 
might be said, a peek-loaf to me in the conseiiueiice ; 
but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed 
thiee of them. This was what I wished for; so I 
took them up, and served them as we serve notori- 
ous thieves in England, sdz., hanged them in chains, 
for a teiTor to others. It is iiiij)o.ssiblc to imagine 
almost that this should have such an effect as it 
had, for the fowls w'ould not only not come at the 
corn, but, in short, they forscxik all that part of the 
island, and I could never .see a bird near the place as 
long as my scare-crows hung there. 

[ 130 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


This I was very glad of, you may be sure ; and 
about the latter end of December, which was our 
second harvest of the year, I reaped my crop. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut 
it down, and all I could do was to make one as well 
as I could out of one of the broadswoitls, or cutlasses, 
which I saved among the arras out of the ship. How- 
ever, as ray first crop was but small, I had no great 
difficulty to cut it down , in short, I reaped it my 
way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and cairied 
it away in a great basket which I had made, and so 
rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of all 
my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of 
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two 
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my 
guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, 
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to 
supply me with bread And yet here I was per- 
plexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or 
make meal of niy corn, or indeed how to dean it 
and part it , nor, if made into meal, how to make 
bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I knew not 
how to bake it, 'Ihese things being added to my 
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to 
secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any 
of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against 
the next season, and, in the meantime, to employ all 
my study and houre of working to accomplish this 
great work of providing myself with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my 
bread. ’T is a little wonderful, and what I believe 
few people have thought much upon, viz., the stiange 
multitude of little things necessary in the providing, 
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing 
this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, 

risi] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


found this to niy daily discouragement, and was 
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even 
after I hod got the first handful of seed-corn, which, 
as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a 
surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no 
spade or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by 
making a wixidcn spade, as I observed Ixiloie, but 
this did my work in but a uooden manner; and 
though it cost me a great many days to make it, 
yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the soonei, 
but made my work the harder, and made it be per- 
formed much worse. 

However, this I bore with, and was content to 
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness 
of the pciformancc. When the corn was sowed, I 
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, 
and drag a gicat heavy bough of a tree over it, to 
scratch it, as it may lie called, rather than rake or 
harrow it. 

When it was growing and grown, I have observed 
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure 
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, 
part it from the chaff, and save it Then I wanted 
a mill to giind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to 
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it, and yet 
all these things I did without, as shall be observed , 
and yet the com \> as an inestimable comfort and ad- 
vantage to me too All this, as I said, made every- 
thing labonous and tedious to me, but that there 
was no help foi ; neither was my time so much loss 
to me, because, as I had dividetl it, a certain part of 
it was every day appointed to these works, and as I 
resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had 
a greater quantity by me, I hod the next six months 
to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to 
furnish myself with utensils proper for the perfomi- 
[ 132 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ing all the operations necessary for the making the 
corn, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had 
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. 
Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to^ 
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but 
a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it. However, I went 
through that, and sowed my sml in two large flat 
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find 
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good 
hedge, the stakes of which « ere all cut of that wo<k1 
which I had set Ixsfore, and knew it would grow ; so 
that in one year’s time I knew I should have a quick 
or living hedge, that would want but little repair. 
This work was not so little as to take me up less 
than three months, hecaust* great part of that time 
was of the wet season, when I couldf not go abroad. 

Within doora, that is. when it rained, and I could 
not go out, I found employment on the following 
occasions , always observing, that all the while I W’as 
at work, I diverted mjself with talking to my panot, 
and teaching him to speak, and I quickly leained 
him to know his own name, and at last to speak it 
out pretty loud, “ Poll," which was the fiisit word I 
ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but 
my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an 
assistant to m3 work ; for now, as I said, I had a 
great employment upon my hands, as follows, viz , I 
had long studied, by some means or other, to make 
myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted 
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. How- 
ever, considering the heat of the climate, I did not 
doubt but if I could find out any such clay, I might 
botch up some such pot as might, being diicd in the 
sun, be hard enough and stnmg enough to bear 
handling, and to hole! anything that was dry, and 
[ 133 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


required to be kept so ; and as this was necessary in 
the preparing corn, meal, Sic., which was the thing 
I was upon, I resolved to make some as large as I 
could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what 
should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh 
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I 'took to 
raise this paste ; what odd. misshapen, ugly things I 
made , how many of them fell in, and how many fell 
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight ; how many cracked by the over-violent heat 
of tlie sun, being set out too nastily , and how many 
fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as 
after they were dried , and, in a woi-d, how, after 
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to 
temper it, to bnng it home, and w'ork it, I could not 
make above two large earthen uglv things (I cannot 
call them jars) in about two months’ laboui. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and 
hard", I lifted them very gently up, and set them 
down again in two great wicker baskets, whic h I had 
made on purpose for them, that they might not 
break ; and as between the pot and the basket there 
was a little ixioni to spare, 1 stuffed it full of the iice 
and barley straw, and thc»c two pots being to stand 
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, 
and perhaps the meal, wlieii the coni was bruised. 

Though I iiiiscairied so much in mj design for 
large pots, yet I made .several smaller things with 
better success ; such as little round pots, Hat dishes, 
pitchers, and pijikins, and any things my hand 
turned to; and the heat of the suii baked them 
strangely hard. But all this would not answer my 
end, which was to get an earthen pot to hold what 
was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of thc.se 
could CIO It happened after some time, making a 
pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went 
[ 134 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to put it out after I had done with it, I found a 
broken piece of one of iny earthenware vessels in the 
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I 
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, 
that certainly they might he made to bum whole, if 
they would bum broken. 

This set me to studying how to order my fire, so 
as to make it burn me some pots. 1 had no notion 
of a kiln, such as the potters bum in, or of glazing 
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it 
with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or 
three pots in a pile, one upon another, and placed 
mv firewood all around it, with a great heap of 
embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh hiel 
round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the 
pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed 
that they did not crack at all When I saw them 
clear red, I let them .stand in that heat about five 
or six hours, till I found one of them, though it did 
not crack, did melt oi run, for the sand which was 
mixed with the cla^ melted by the violence of the 
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone 
on , so I slacked my firo gradually till the pots 
began to abate of the red colour , and watching 
them all night, that I might not let the fire 
abate too fast, in the morning I had three very 
good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two 
other earthen pot.s, as hard burnt as could be desired, 
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running 
of the sand. 

After this experiment. I need not say that I wanted 
no sort of earthenware for my use , but I must needs 
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indiffer- 
ent, as any one may supppse, when I had no way of 
making them but as the children make dirt pies, or 
as a woman would make pies that never learned to 
raise paste. 

[ 135 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever 
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen 
pot that «ould bear the fire; and I had hardly 
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one 
upon the fiie again, with some water in it, to boil 
me some meat, which it did admirably well ; and 
with a piece of a kid I made some very good binth, 
though I wanted oatmeal and several other ingre- 
dients re(]uibite to make it so good as 1 would have 
had it been. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to 
stamp or beat some com in , for as to the mill, there 
was no thought at ai i iv mg to that perfection of art 
with one pair of hands To supply this want I was 
at a great loss, foi, of all trades in the world, I 
was as perfectly unqualifieil for a stone-cutter as for 
any whatever , neither had I any tools to go about 
it with I sfient many a day to find out a great 
stone big enough to {-ut hollow, and make fit for a 
mortar, and could find none at all, except what was 
in the solid rock, and whuh I had no way to dig or 
cut out ; nor indeed were the rix;ks in the island of 
hai-diiess sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling 
stone, which neither would liear the weight of a heavy 
pestle, or would break the corn without filling it 
with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in 
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to 
look out for a great block of hard wood, which I 
found indeed inuch easier , and getting one as big as 
I had strength to stir, I ixiundi d it, and formed it m 
the outside with iny axe and liatehet, and then, 
with the help of fire, and infinite labour, maxle a 
hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make 
their canoes After this, I made a great heavy 
pestle, or beater, of the wood called the iron- wood; 
and this I piepai-ed and laid by against I had my 
next crop of corir, when I pioposed to myself to 

[ 136 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

grind, or ratiier pound, my com into meal, to make 
my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, oi search, 
to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and 
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I 
could have any bread. This was a most difficult 
thing, so much as but to think on, for to be sure I 
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; 
I mean fine thin canvas or stuff, to search the meal 
through. And here I was at a full stop for many 
months, nor did I really know what to do ; linen I 
had none left, but what was mere rajjs , I bad goats’- 
hair, but neither knew 1 how to weave it or spin it ; 
and had I known how, here was no tools to work it 
with. All the remedy that I found for this was, 
that at last I did renieinlier I had, among the sea- 
men’s clothes which were saved out of the ship, some 
neckcloths of calico or muslin , and with some pieces 
of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough 
for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years. 
How I did afterwanls, I shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be con- 
sidered, and how I should make bread when I came 
to have corn , for, first I had no \cast As to that 
part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did 
not concern myself much about it ; but for an oven 
I was indeed in great pain. At length I found out 
an experiment for that also, which was this I made 
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that 
IS to sav, about two feet diameter, and not above 
nine inches deep , these I burned in the fire, as I had 
done the other, and laid them by, and when I 
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, 
which I had paved with some square tiles, of my 
own making and burning also , but I should not call 
them square. 

When the firewood was burned pretty much into 

[ 137 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this 
hearth, so ew to cover it all ovei, and there I let 
them lie till the hearth was veiy hot ; then sweep- 
ing away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or 
loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upon 
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the 
pot, to keep in and add to the heat. And thus, as 
well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my 
barley-loaves, and became, in little time, a mere 
pastry-cook into the liargain , for I made myself 
several cakes of the rice, and puddings , indeed I 
made no pies, neither had I anj'tliiiig to put into 
them, supposing I had, except the flesh cither of 
fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things 
took me up most part of the thii d year of my abode 
here ; for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of 
these things I had my new haricst and husbandry to 
manage, for I reaped my corn in its season, and 
canied it home as well as I could, and laid it up in 
the ear, in niy large baskets, till I had time to rub 
it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instru- 
ment to thrash it with 

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I 
really wanted to build my biriis biggei I wanted a 
place to lay it up in, for ’^lie increase of the com now 
yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about 
twenty bushels, and of the nee as much, oi more, 
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely , 
for my bread had been quite gone a gieat while ; also, 
I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient 
for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the foi-ty bushels of 
barley and rice was much more than I coiild consume 
in a year ; so I resolved to sow just the same quantity 
every year that I sowed the la.st, in hopes that such 
a quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c. 
[ 138 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


All the while these things were doing, you may 
be sure iriy thoughts ran many times upon the pros- 
pect of land which I had seen from the other side of 
the island, and I was not without secret wishes that 
I were on shore there, fancying the seeing the main- 
land, and in an inhabited country, I might find some 
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps 
at last find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the 
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall 
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might 
have reason to think far worse than the lions and 
tigera of Africa , that if I once came into their power, 
I should lain a hazard more than a thousand to one 
of being killed, and perhaps of Ixnng eaten , for I had 
heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were 
cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude 
that I could not be far off from that shore. That sup- 
pose they were not cannibals, yet that they might kill 
me, a.s many Europeans who had fallen into their 
hands had been served, even when they had been 
ten or twenty together, much more I, that was but 
one, and could make little or no defence ; all these 
things, I say, which I ought to have considered well 
of, and did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet 
took up none of my apprehensions at first, but iiiy 
head ran mightily upon the thought of getting ovei 
to the shore 

Now I wished for iny boy Xury, and the long-boat 
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed 
above a thousand miles on the coast of Afnca , but 
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and 
look at our ship’s boat, which, as I have said, was 
blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, 
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where 
she did at first, but not quite ; and was turned, by 
the force of the wav6s and the winds, almost bottom 
[ 139 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


upward, against a high ridge of bcachy rough sand, 
but no water about her, as before. 

If I had had hands to have rchtted her, and to have 
launched her into the water, the boat would have done 
well enough, and I might have gone liaek into the 
Brazils with her easily enough, but I might have 
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her 
upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the 
island. However, I went to the woods, and cut levels 
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved 
to try what I could do , .suggesting to myself that if 
I could but turn her down, I might easily repair the 
damage she had received, and she would be a very 
good boat, and I might go to sea in her v cry easily. 

1 spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless 
toil, and &|K;nt, I think, three or four weeks about it. 
At last finding it impo.ssiblc to heave it up with niy 
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to 
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting 
pieces of wcnid to thrust and guide it right in the fall. 
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up 
again, or to get under it, much less to move it for- 
w’ard towards the water ; so I w as forced to give it 
over. And yet, though I gave over the hopes of the 
boat, iny desire to venture over for the main increased, 
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed 
impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it 
was not pos-sible to make myself a canoe, or pertagua, 
such as the natives of those climates make, even with- 
out tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz , of 
the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought 
possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with 
the thoughts of making it, and with my having much 
more convenience for it than any of the negrees or 
Indians ; but not at all considering the particular 
inconveniences which I lay under more than the In- 
[ 140 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


dians did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was 
made, into the water, a diflRculty much harder for me 
to surmount than all the conse<|uences of want of 
tools could be to them. For what was it to me, that 
when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might 
with much trouble cut it down, if, after I might be 
able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into 
the proper shape of a boat, and bum or cut out the 
inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it ; 
if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I 
found it, and was not able to launch it into the 
water ? 


One would have thought I could not have had the 
least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance 
while I was making this boat, but I should have im- 
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea; 
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage 
over tlie sea in it, that I never once considered how 
I should get it oft' of the land , and it was really, in its 
own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty- 
five miles of sea, than about forty-five fiithoms of 
land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a 
fool that ever man did who had any of his senses 


awake. I pleased myself with the design, without 
determining vilietlier I was ever able to undertake 
it. Not but that the difficulty of launching my boat 
came often into my head ; but I put a stop to my 
own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer which I 
gave myself, “Let’s first make it; I’ll warrant I’ll 
And some way or other to get it along when ’tis 
done.” 


This was a most preposterous method ; but the 
engeniess of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. 
I felled a cedar tree . I question much whether Solo- 
mon ever had such a one for the building of the 
Temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches 
- [ 1 «] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four 
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two 
feet, after which it lessened for awhile, and then 
parted into branches. It was not without infinite 
labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days 
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom , I was four- 
teen more getting the branches and limbs, and the 
vast spreading he.ad of it cut off, which I hacked and 
hewed through w ith axe and hatchet, and inexpressi- 
ble labour. After this, it cost me a month to shape 
it and dub it to a proportion, and to .something like 
the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as 
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more 
to clear the inside, and w'ork it so as to make an exact 
boat of it This I did, indeed, without fire, by nieie 
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, 
till I had brought it to be a veiy handsome 
and big enough to ha^e earned six and twenty men, 
and consequently big enough to have carried me and 
all my cargo 

when I had gone through this woi k, I was ex- 
tremely delighted with it The boat was really much 
bigger than I ever saw a canoe ov j>eri<tffiia, that was 
made of one tice, in ray life Many a weary stroke 
it had cost, you may be sure ; and there lemained 
nothing but to get it into the water, and had I 
gotten it into the water, I make no question but 
I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the 
most unlikely to be perfoimed, that e\er was under- 
taken 

But all my devices to gel it into the water failed 
me, though they cost me infinite labour too. It lay 
about one luindied yards from the water, and not 
more ; but the fii.st iiiconveiiience was, it was uphill 
towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis- 
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of 
the e^h, and so make a declivity This I began, 
[14g] ' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; but who 
grudges pains, that have their deliverance in view ? 
But when this was worked through, and this difficulty 
managed, it was still much at one, for I could no 
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re- 
solved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to 
the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to 
the water. Well, I began this work , and when I 
began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was 
to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out, 
I found that by the number of hands I had, being none 
but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years 
befoie I should have gone through with it ; for the 
shore lay high, so tliat at the upper end it must have 
been at least twenty feet deep , so at length, though 
with great leluctancy, I gave this attempt over also 

This gneved me heartily, and now I saw, though 
too late, the folly of lieginning a work before we 
count the cost, and lieforc we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go thiough with it. 

In the middle of this woik I finished my fourth 
year in this place, and kept my anniveiwary with the 
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever be- 
fore , foi, by a constant study and serious applica- 
tion of the Woixl of God, and by the assistance of 
His grace, I gamed a different knowledge from what 
I h^ before I entei-tained different notions of 
things. I looked now upon the world as a thing 
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expecta- 
tion from, and, indeed, no desires about. In a word, 
I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like 
to have , so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps 
look upon it herea&r, viz., as a place I haii liverl in, 
but was come out of it ; and well might I say, as 
father Abraham to Dives, “ Between me and thee is 
a great gulf fixed.” 

[ 143 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


In the first place, I was removed from all the 
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the lust 
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pnde of life. 
I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now 
capable of enjoying. I was lord of the whole manor ; 
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor 
over the whole country which I had possession of. 
There weie no rivals . I had no competitor, none to 
dispute sovcieigiity or command with me. I might 
have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use 
for it , so I let as little grow as I thought enough 
for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtles enough, 
but now and then one was as much as I could put to 
any use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet 
of ships. I had grapes enough to have made w'liie, 
or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that 
fleet when thev had been built. 

But all I could make use of w as all that was valuable. 
I had enough to eat and to supply my wants, and 
what was all the rest to me ^ If I killed more flesh 
than I could cat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin. 
If I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must lx: 
spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to 
rot on the ground, I could make no moie use of 
them than for fuel, and that I had no occasion foi 
but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things 
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the 
good things of this woild arc no farther good to us 
than they are for our use , and that whatever wo 
may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just 
as much as we can use, and no more. The most 
covetous griping miser in the world would have been 
cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been in 
my case ; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew 
what to do with. I had no iixnii for desire, except 
it was of things which I had not, and they weie but 
[ 144 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, 
as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold 
as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas' 
there the nasty, .sorry, useless stuff lay ; I had lio 
manner of business for it ; and I often thought with 
myself, that I would have given a handful of it for 
a gros.s of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind 
iny corn ; nay, I would have given rt all for six- 
penny-worth of tuniip and caiTot seed out of Eng- 
land, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a 
bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least ad- 
vantage by it, or benefit from it ; but there it lay 
in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the 
cave 111 the w et season , and if I had had the drawer 
full of diamonds, it had been the same case, and 
they had been of no manner of value to me because 
of no Use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much 
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier 
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently 
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired 
the hand of God’s providence, w'hich had thus spread 
iny table in the wilderness. I learned to look more 
upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon 
the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather 
than what I wanted ; and this gave me sometiiiies 
such secret comforts, that I cannot express them , 
and which I take notice of here, to put tho.se dis- 
contented people III mind of it, who cannot enjoy 
comfortably what God has given them, because they 
•see and covet something that He has not given 
them. All our discontents about what we want, 
appeared to me to spring from the w'ant of thank- 
fulness for what we liave. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and 
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall 
into such distress as mine was ; and this was, to 
VOL. I — 10 [ 145 J 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


compare my present condition with what I at first 
expected it should be ; nay, with what it would 
cjrtainlv have been, if the good providence of God 
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up 
nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at 
her, but could bring what I got out ef her to the 
shore, for my relief and comfort ; without which I 
had wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, 
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent w’hole hours, I may say whole days, in 
representing to myself, in the most lively colours, 
how I must have acted if I hod got nothing out of 
the ship. How I could not have so much as got 
any food, except fish and turtles ; and that as it 
was long before I found any of them, I must have 
perisheii first , that I should have lived, if I had not 
perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed 
a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way 
to flay or open them, or part the flesh from the 
skill and the bowels, or to cut it up , but must gnaw 
it with my teeth, and pull it w'lth my claws, like 
a beast. 

These reflections mode me verv sensible of the 
gotKlncss of Providence to me, and v’ery thankful for 
my pre.sent condition, with all its hardships and mis- 
fortunes ; and this part also I cannot but recom- 
mend to the reflection of those w ho are apt, in their 
misery, to sa>. Is any affliction like mine? Let 
them consider how much worse the coses of some 
people are, and their case might have been, if Provi- 
dence had thought fit 

I had anothei leflection, which assisted me also to 
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was, compar- 
ing my present condition with what I had deserved, 
and half therefore reason to expect from the hand of 
Providence. I had lived a dicadful life, perfectly 
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had 
[146J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


been well instructed by fiither and mother ; neither 
had they been wanting to me in their early endeav- 
ours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, 
a sense of niy duty, and of what the natuixi and end 
of iny being required of me. But, alas ' falling early 
into the seafaring life, which, of all the lives, is the 
most destitute of the fear of God, though His terrors 
are always before them , I say, falling early into the 
seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that 
little sense of religion which I had entertained was 
laughed out of me by my messiiiates , by a hardened 
despising of dangers, and the mows of death, which 
grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all 
manner of opportunities to converse with anything 
but what was like myself, or to hear an\ thing that 
was good, or tended towanls it. 

So void was I of everything that was good, or of 
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in 
the greatest deliverances I enjoyed, such as my es- 
cape from Sallee , iiiy being taken up by the Portu- 
guese master of the ship . my being planted so well 
in the Brazils ; my receiving the cargo from England, 
and the like; I never had once the words, “Thank 
God,” so much as on ray mind, or in my inoutli ; nor 
in the greatest distress Jiad I so much as a tliought 
to pray to Him, or so much as to say, “ Lord, have 
mercy upon me ' ” no, nor to mention the name of 
God, unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my niina for many 
months, as I have ah-eady observed, on the account 
of my wicked and hardened life past ; and when I 
looked about me, and considered what particular 
providences had attended me since my coming into this 
pUce, and how G(k 1 had dealt bountifully with me, 
had not only punished me less than my iniquity had 
deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me; 
this gave me great hopes that iny repentance was 

ri473 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

accepted, and that Grod had yet meicy in store for 
me. 

With these reflections, I worked niv mind up, not 
only to resignation to the will of God in the present 
disposition of my circumstant^es, but even to a sin- 
cere thankfulness for my condition , and that I, alio 
was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing 
I had not the due punishment of my sms; that I 
enjo}ed so many mercies, which I had no reason to 
have expected in that place ; that I ought never 
more to lepine at my condition, but to rejoice, and 
to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which noth- 
ing blit a crowd of wonders could have brought ; that 
I ought to consider I had been fed even by miracle, 
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; 
nay, by a long senes of miracles ; and that I could 
hardly have named a place in the unhabitable part 
of the world where I could have been cast more to 
my advantage , a place where, as I had no society, 
which was my affliction on one band, so I found 
no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to 
threaten my life , no venomous creatures oi poison- 
ous, w’hich I might feed on to my hurt , no savages 
to murder and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sormw one way, 
so it was a life of mercy another , and I wanted noth- 
ing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to 
make my senst' of Gml’s gtaidncss to me, and care 
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation , 
and after I did make a just improvement of these 
things, I went away, and was no more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things 
which I brought on shore for my help were either 
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent. 
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, 
all but a very little, which I ekeil out with water, 
a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left 
[ 148 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


any appearance of black upon the paper. As long 
as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the 
days of the month on which any remarkable thing 
happened to me. And, first, by casting up times 
past, I rememlier that there was a strange concur- 
rence of days in the various providences which befell 
me, and which, if I had been sujierstitiously inclined 
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have 
had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of 
curiosity. 

First, I had observed that the same day that I 
broke aw'av fi'oin my father and my friends, and run 
away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day 
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and 
made a slave. 

'J'he same day of the year that I escaped out of 
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that 
same day-year afterwaids I made my escape from 
Sallee in the boat. 

The same day of the year I was bom on, viz , the 
30th of September, that same day I had my life so 
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I 
was cast on shore in this island ; so that niy wicked 
life and iny solitary life began both on a day. 

'fhe next thing to my ink’s being wasted, was that 
of my bread , I mean the biscuit, which I brought 
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last 
degree, allow'ing myself but one cake of bread a day 
for above a year j and yet I was quite without bread 
for near a year before I got any com of my own ; 
and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any 
at all, the getting it being, as has been already 
observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes began to decay, too, mightily. As to 
linen, I had none a good while, except some chequered 
shirts which I found in the chests of the other sea- 
men, and which I carefully preserved, because many 

ri49] 



ROBINSON- CRUSOE 


times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt ; 
and it was a very great help to me that I had, among 
all the inen's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen 
of shiits. There were also several thick watch-coats 
of the seamen’s which were left indeed, but they 
were too hot to wear, and though it is tiue that 
the weather was so violent hot that there was no 
need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked, no, 
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not, 
nor could abide the thoughts of it, though I was all 
alone. 

The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I 
could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite 
naked as W’lth some clothes on, nay, the very heat 
frequently bhsteied my skin, whereas, with a shut 
on, the an itself made some motion, and whistling 
under that shirt, was twofold cooler than without 
it. No more could I ever bring mvself to go out 
in the heat of the sun without a caji or a hat. The 
heat of the sun lieatiiig with such violence, as it docs 
in that place, would gne me the headache piesently, 
by darting so directly on ray head, without a cap or 
hat on, so that I i-ould not bear it , whereas, if I put 
on my hat, it would presently go away 

Upon those views, I began to consuler about put- 
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into 
some order I had worn out all the waistcoats I 
had, and my business was now to try if I could not 
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I 
had by me, and with such other materials as I had , so 
I set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botch- 
ing, for I made most piteous work of it However, 
1 made shift to make two or three new waistcoats, 
which I hoped would serve me a great while. As 
for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift 
indeed till afterward. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all 
(ISO] 



ROBINSON CRUSOB 


the creatures that I killed, I meati four-footed ones, 
and I had hung them up stretched out with sticks 
in the sun, by which means some of them were so 
dry and hal'd that they were fit for little, but others 
it seems were very useful, 'fhe first thing I made 
of these was a great cap for iiiv head, with the hair 
on the outside, to shoot off the rain , and this I 
performed so well, that after this I made me a suit 
of clothes wholly of these skins, that is to say, a 
waistcoat, and breeches open at knees, and both 
loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool 
than to keep me warm. I must nut omit to acknowl- 
edge that they were wretchedly made; for if I 
was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor How- 
ever, they wei'c such as I made veiy good shift with , 
and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the 
hair of my waistcoat and cap lieing outermost, I was 
kept very dry. 

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains 
to make me an umbiella I was indeed in great want 
of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had 
seen them made m the Brazils, where they are very 
useful m the great heats which are there ; and I felt 
the heats every jot a.s great here, and greater too, 
being nearer the etjuinox. Besides, as I was obliged 
to Ix! much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, 
as well for the lains as the heats. I took a world 
of pains at it, and was a great while before I could 
make anything likely to hold , nay, after I thought 
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or thi’ee before I 
made one to my mind ; but at last I made one that 
answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I 
found was to make it to let down I could make it to 
spread ; but if it did not let down too, and draw in, 
it was not portable for me any way but just over my 
head, which would not do. However, at last, as I 
said, I made one to answer, and covered it with 
[1611 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rains 
like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, 
that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather 
with greater advantage than I could before in the 
coolest ; and when I had no need of it, could close 
it, and carry it under my arm 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being 
entirely composed by resigning to the will of God, 
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of His 
providence. This made my life hcttei than sociable ; 
for when I began to regret the want of conversation, 
I would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually 
with my own thoughts and, us I hope I may say, 
with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not 
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society 
in the world ? 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any 
extraordinary thing happened to me , but I lived on 
in the same course, in the same posture and place, 
just as before. The chief things I was employed in, 
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
nee, and euruig my raisins, of both which I always 
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one 
year’s provisions beforehand — I say, besides this 
yearly labour, aii<l my daily labour of going out 
with my gun, I had one labour, to make me a canoe, 
which at last I finished ; so that by digging a canal 
to it of SIX feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought 
it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, 
which was so vastly big, as I made it without con- 
sidering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I .should 
be able to launch it , so, never being able to bring it 
to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged 
to let it lie w here it was, as a memorandum to teach 
me to be wiser next time. Indeed, the next time, 
though I could not get a tree proper for it, and in a 
place where I could not get the water to it at any 
[ 152 ] 



ROBINSON CRITSOK 


less disbiiice than, as I have said, near half a mile, 
yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never ga\e 
it over , and though I was near two yeais about it, 
yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a 
boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little peringtM was finished, 
yet the si/e of it was not at all answerable to the 
design which I had in view when I made the first ; I 
mean, of venturing over to the terra fimui, where it 
was above forty miles broad. Accordingly, the 
smallness of iny boat assisted to put an end to that 
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I 
had a boat, my next design was to make a tour round 
the island , for as I had been on the other side in one 
place, crossing, as I have already described it, over 
the land, so the discovenes I made in that little jour- 
ney made me very eager to see other parts of the 
coast , and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing 
but sailing round the island 

For this purpose, that I might do everything w'lth 
discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast 
to my Ixiat, and made a sail to it out of some of the 
pieces of the ship’s sail, which lay in store, and of 
which I had a gieat stock by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, 
I found she would sail very well. 'Hien I made little 
lockers, or boxes, at either end of my boat, to put 
provisions, necessaiies, and ammunition, &c., into, 
to be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of 
the sea , and a little long hollow plac-e I cut in 
the inside of the boat, where I could laj my gun, 
making a flap to hang down over it to keep it 
dry. 

I fi.xcd my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like 
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of 
the sun off of me, like an awning , and thus I every 
now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but 
[ 153 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


never went far out, nor far from the little creek. But 
at last, being eager to view the circumference of my 
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour; and ac- 
cordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting 
in two du7£n of my loav^ (cakes I should rather call 
them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parc-hed 
rice, a food I eat a great deal of, a little bottle of 
rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing 
more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as 
I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen’s 
chests , these I took, one to he upon, and the other 
to cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of 
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I 
set out on this voyage, and 1 found it much longer 
than I expected; for though the island itself was 
not veiy large, yet when 1 came to the east side of 
it, I found a great ledge of rocks he out above two 
leagues into the .sea, some above water, some under 
it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a 
league more , so that I w'as obliged to go a great way 
out to sea to double the jxnnt 

When fiftt I discovered them, I was going to give 
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know- 
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, 
above all, doubting how I should get back again, so 
I came to an anchor ; for I had made me a kind of 
an anchor with a piece of a broken gi'appling which 
I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went 
on shore, chinbing up upon a lull, which seemed to 
overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of it, 
and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I 
stood, I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious 
current, which run to the cast, and even came close 
to the point ; and I took the more notice of it, because 
[ 154. J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I saw there might be some danger tliat when I came 
into it I might be carried out to sea by the strength 
of it, and not be able to make the island again,^ And 
indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this hill, 1 
believe it would have been so ; for there was the same 
current on the other side the island, only that it set 
off at a farther distance ; and I saw there was a strong 
eddy under the shore , so I had nothing to do but to 

f et in out of the first current, and I should presently 
e in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind, 
blowing pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just 
contrary to the said current, made a great breach of 
the sea upon the point , so that it was not safe for 
me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor 
to go too far off because of the stream. 

The thirrl dn>, in the ^morning, the wind having 
abated overnight, the .sea was calm, and I ventured 
But I am a warning piece again to all rash and 
Ignorant pilots, for no sooner was I come to the 
point, when even I was not my boat’s length from 
the shore, but I found myself in a gi-eat depth of 
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It 
earned my lioat along with ib with such violence, 
that all I could do could not keep her so much as on 
the edge of it, but I found it huiried me farther and 
faither out from the e«ldv, which was on my left 
hand. I'here was no wind stirring to help me, and 
all I could do with my paddlers signified nothing 
And now I began to give myself over for lost ; for, 
as the currc'nt was on both sides the island, I knew 
in a few leagues distance they must join again, and 
then I was irrecoverably gone. Nor did I see any 
possibility of avoiding it , so that I had no prospect 
before me but of pci ishing , not by the sea, for that 
was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had 
indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost 
[156] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat ; and 
I had a gi’cat jar of fresh water, that is to say, one 
of my,earthen pots , but what was all this to being 
driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there 
was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand 
leagues at least 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence 
of fxod to make the most miserable condition man- 
kind could be in worse. Now I looked back upon 
my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant 
place in the world, and all the happiness mv heart 
could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched 
out my hands to it, with eager wishes. “ O happy 
desert !” said I, “I shall nc\ei sec thee more. O 
niiseiable creature,” said I, “ whither am I going'' ” 
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful 
temper, and how I had repined at my solitary con- 
dition , and now what would I give to be on shore 
theic again. Thus we never see the true state of 
our condition till it is illustrated to us by its con- 
traries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but 
by the want of it It is scarce possible to imagine 
the consternation I was now' m, being dnven from 
niy beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to 
be) into the wide ocean, almost tw'o leagues, and in 
the utmost despaii of ever i-ecovcring it again. 
However, I woiked li.aivl, till indeed iny strength 
was almost exhausted, and kept mv boat as much to 
the northward, that is, towaids the side of the cin- 
rent which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could , 
when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I 
thought I felt a little biee/e of wind in my face, 
springing up fi’om the S.S.E. This cheered my 
heart a little, and especially w hen, in about half-an- 
hoiir more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By 
this time I was gotten at a fnghtful distance from 
the island ; and had the least cloud or hazy weather

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


intervened, I had been undone another way too ; for 
I had no compass on board, and should never have 
known how to have steered towards the island if I 
had but once lost sight of it. But the weather con- 
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast 
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north 
as much as poasible, to get out of the cun'ciit. 

J ust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat 
began to .stretch away, I saw even by the clearness 
of the water some alteration of the current was near , 
for where the current was so strong, the water was 
foul. But peiceiviiig the water clear, I found the 
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at 
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some 
rucks. These rocks I found caused the current to 
part again, and as the main stress of it ran away 
more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, 
so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and 
made a strong tsldy, which ran back again to the 
uoith-wcst with a very sharp stream. 

They who know wliat it is to have a reprieve 
brought to them miuii the ladder, or to be rescued 
from thieves just going to murder them, or who 
have lieen in such like extremities, may guess what 
my present surprise of joy was, and liow gladly I 
put my boat into the stream of this eddy, and the 
wind also freshening, how gladly I sjircad my sail to 
it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a 
strong tide or eddy under foot. 

Tins eddy carried me about a league in iny way 
back again, directly towards the island, but about 
two leagues more to the northward than the current 
which carried me away at first , so that when I came 
near the island, I found myself open to the northeni 
shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, 
opposite to that which I went out fiom. 

When I bad mode something more than a league 

[ 157 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found 
it was spent, and served me no farther. However, I 
found that being between the two great currents, 
VIZ , that on the south side, which had hurried me 
away, and that on the north, which lay about a 
league on the other side ; I say, betw cen these two, 
in the wake of the island, I found the water at least 
still, and running no way , and having still a breeze 
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for 
the island, though not making sueli fresh way as I 
did before. 

About four o’clock in the evening, being then 
within about a league of the island, I found the 
point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster 
stretching out, as is described before, to the south- 
wai-d, and casting off the current more southwardly 
had, of course, made another eddy to the north, and 
this I found very .strong, but not (brectly setting the 
way iny course lay, which was due west, but almost 
fullnoith. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched 
across this eddy, slanting north-west , and in about 
an hour came within about a mile of the shore, 
where, it being sinuotb water, I soon got to land. 

When I w'as on shore, I fell on iny knees, and 
gave God tlianks for iiiy deliverance, re.sol\ing to 
lav aside all thoughts of my deliverance by iny boat , 
and refreshing myself with such things as I had, 
1 brought iny boat close to the shore, in a little cove 
that I had s^cd under sonic trees, and laid me down 
to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and 
fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which wav to get home 
with my boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew 
too much the case, to think of attempting it by the 
way I went out, and what might be at the other 
side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I 
any mind to run any more ventures. So I only re- 
[ 158 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


solved in the morning to make my way westward 
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek 
where I might lay up my fngate in safety, so as to 
have her again if I wanted her. In about three 
miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to 
a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which 
narrows till it came to a very little rivulet or 
brook, where I found a very convenient harboui for 
my boat, and where she lay ns if she had been in a 
little dock made on purpose for her Here I put in, 
and having stowed my boat ver\ safe, I went on 
shore to look about me, and see where I was. 

I soon found I hud but a little passed by the 
place where I had been before, when I traveUed on 
foot to that shore ; so taking nothing out of my 
boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was ex- 
ceedingly hot, I began ray march. The way was 
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had 
been upon, and I reached my old bower in the even- 
ing, where I found everything standing as I left it ; 
for I always kept it in good order, being, as I .said 
before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the 
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and 
fell asleep. But judge you, if you can, that read 
my story, what a surprize I must be in, when I was 
waked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my 
name several times, “ Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, 
poor Robin Crusoe • Where are you, Robin Crusoe 
Where are you Where have you been ^ ” 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with 
row'ing, oi paddling, as it is called, the first part of 
the day, and with walking the latter part, that I did 
not wake thoroughly ; but dozing between sleeping 
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody 
spoke to me But as the voice continued to repeat 
“ Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,” at last I began to 
[159J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully 
frighted, and started up in the utmost consternation. 
But no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll 
sitting oil the top of the hedge, and immediately knew 
that it was he that spoke to me ; for just in such 
bemoaning laiigimge I had used to talk to him, and 
teach him , and he had learned it so perfectly, that 
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close 
to my face, and cry, “ Poor Robin Crusoe ' Where 
arc you ? Where have you been ^ How come you 
here and such things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the pairot, 
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a 
good while before I could conipo.se nivself First, I 
was amazed how the ci-eature got thither, and then, 
how he should just keep about the place*, and no- 
where else But as I was well satisfied it could lie 
nobody but honest Poll, I ^t it over , and holding 
out my hand, and calling him by his iiaine. Poll, the 
sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my 
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to 
me, “ Poor Robin Crusoe ’ .and how* did I come here ^ 
and where had I been just as if he had been ovei- 
joyed to see me again , and so 1 cairied hiin home 
along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sen for some 
tune, and had enough to do for nianv days to sit 
still, and reflect upon the danger 1 had been in I 
would have been very glad to have had my boat 
again on my side of the island , but I knew* not how 
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east 
side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew 
well enough there was no ventuniig that way , my 
very heart would shrink, and ray very blood inn 
chill, but to think of it And as to the other side 
of the island, I did not know how it might be there ; 
but supposing the cun’ent ran with the same force 
[160] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

against the shore at the east as it passed by it 
on the other, I might run the same risk of being 
driven down the stream, and earned by the island, 
as I had been before of being carried away from it. 
So, with these thoughts, I contented myself to be 
without any boat, though it had been the product 
of so many months' labour to make it, and of so 
many more to get it unto the sea. 

In this government of my temper I remained near 
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may 
well suppose; and my thoughts being very much 
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in 
resigning myself to the dispositions of Piovidence, I 
thought I lived really very happily in all things, 
except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic 
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying 
myself to, and I believe could, upon occasion, make 
a very good carpenter, especially considering how 
few tools I had. Besides this, I arrived at an 
unexpected perfection in my earthenware, and con- 
trived well enough to make them with a wheel, 
which I found uifiiiitely easier and better, because 
I made things round and sliajiablc which before w'cre 
filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I wa.s 
never more vain of my own pciformance, or more joy- 
ful for anything I found out, than foi my being able 
to make a tobacco-pipe. And though it was a very 
Ugly clumsy tiling when it was done, and only burnt 
red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and 
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly 
comfoited with it; for I had been always used to 
smoke, and there were pijies in the ship, but I forgot 
them at first, not knowing that there was tobacco in 
the island , and afterwards, w hen I searched the ship 
again, I could not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


abundance of necess^iry baskets, as well as my inven- 
tion showed me, though not very handsome, yet 
they were such as were very handy and convenient 
for uiy laying things up in, or fetching things home 
in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could 
hang it up in a tiee, flay it, and dress it, and cut it 
in pieces, and bung it home in a basket , and the 
like by a turtle , I could cut it up, take out the eggs, 
and a piece or two of the flesh, winch was enough 
for me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave 
the rest behind me Also large deep baskets were 
my rwHiivers for my corn, which I always nibbed out 
as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in gieat 
baskets. 

I began now to perceive iiiv powder abated con- 
siderably, and this was a waiit’which it was impos- 
sible for me to supply, and I Ixigan scriouslv to 
consider what I must do when I should have no 
mure jxiwder . that is to say, how I should do to kill 
any goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year 
of my being here kept a young kid, and bred her up 
tame, and I was in hope of getting a he-goat But 
I could not bv any means bring it to pass, till my 
kid gi'ew an old goat; and I could never find in my 
heait to kill her, till .she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of niy resi- 
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition growing 
low, I set III) self to study .some art to trap and snare 
the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of 
them alive, and particularly, I wanted a she-goat 
great with young. 

To this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, 
and I do believe they were more than once taken in 
them ; but my tackle was not good, for I had no 
w'ire, and I always found them broken, and my bait 
devoured. At length I resolved to try a pitfall , so 
I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where 
[ 162 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I had observed the goats used to feed, and over these 
pits I placed huidlcs, of in^ own making too, with a 
great weight upon them , and several times I put ears 
of barley and ary nee, without setting the trap, and 
I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in 
and eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark of 
their feet. At length I set three traps in one night, 
and going the next inoniing, I found them all stand- 
ing, and vet the bait eaten and gone , this was very 
discouraging. However, I altered rny trap, and, 
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morn- 
ing to see mv trap, I found m one of them a laige 
old he-goat, and lu one of the othei three kids, a male 
and two females. 

As to the old one, 1 knew not what to do with 
him, he was so ficice I durst not go into the pit to 
him , that i.s to say, to go alamt to bring him away 
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed 
him, but that was not iny business, iioi would it 
answer iny end , so I even let liini out, and he ran 
away, as if he had lieen flighted out of his wits. But 
I liM forgot then what I learned afterwards, that 
hungei will tame a lion. If I hiwl let him stay there 
three or four days witlioiit food, and then have ear- 
ned him some water to dntik, and then a little com, 
he would have been as tame as one of the kids, for 
they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures where 
they arc well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing 
no better at that time. Then I went to the three 
kids, and taking them one by one,! tied them with 
strings together, and with some difficulty brought 
tiicm all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed, but 
throwing them some sweet com, it tempted them, 
and they began to lie tame. And now I found that 
if I expeefed to .supply myself with goat-flesh when I 
[163] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them 
about my house like a flock of sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me that I must 
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would 
always run wild when they grew up , and the only 
way for this was to have some enclosed piece of 
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to 
keep them in so effectually, that those within might 
not break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of 
hands ; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity 
of doing it, niv first piece of work was to find out a 

n er piece of ground, viz., where there was likely 
e herbage for them to eat, water for them to 
diink, and cover to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think 
I had very little contiivance when I pitched upon a 
place very proper for all these, being a plain open 
piece of meadow land, or savanna (as our people call 
it fn the western colonies), which had two or three lit- 
tle dnlls of fresh water in it, and at one end was very 
woody ; I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I 
shall tell them I began my enclosing of this piece of 
ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale 
must have lx;en at least two miles about. Nor was 
the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it 
was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough 
to do it in. But I did not consider that my goats 
would be as wild in so much compass as if they had 
had the whole island, and I should have so much 
room to chase them in, that I should never catch 
them. 

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, 
about fifty yards, w’hen this thought occurred to me, 
so I presently stopfied short, and, for the first be- 
ginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about 150 
[164] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


yards in length, and 100 yaids in breadth , which, 
as it would maintain as many es I should have in 
any reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I 
could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went 
to work with courage. I was about three months 
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, 
I tetliered the three kids in the best part of it, and 
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make 
them familiar ; and very often I would go and carry 
them some cal's of barley, or a handful of rice, and 
feed them out of my hand ; so that after my en- 
closure was finished, and I let them loose, the^ 
would follow me up and down, bleating after me 
for a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and 
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and 
all, and in two }ears more I had three and forty, 
besides several that I took and killed for my food. 
And after that I enclosed five several pieces of 
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive 
them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out 
of one piece of ground into another. 

But this WU.S not all, for now I not only had goat’s 
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a 
thing which, indeed, in my beginning, I did not so 
much as think of, and which, when it came into my 
thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise. For 
now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon 
or two of milk in a day , anil as Nature, who gives 
supplies of food to eveiy creature, dictates even 
naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never 
milked a cow, much les.s a goat, or .seen butter oi 
cheese made, very readily and handily, though alter 
a great many essays and miscarriages, made me 
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it 
afterwards.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


How mercifully- can our great Creator treat His 
creatures, even in those conditions in which they 
seemed to be overwhelmed iii destruction ' How 
can He sweeten the bitterest pio\idences, and give 
us cause to- praise Him for dungeons and prisons • 
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder- 
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for 
hunger ' 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen 
me and my little family sit down to dinner There 
was my majesty, the prmce and lord of the whole 
island, I had the lives of all my subjects at my abso- 
lute cominand I could hang, draw, give liberty, and 
take it away , and no rebels among all my subjects 

Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all 
alone, attended by iny servants. Poll, as if lie barl 
been my favourite, was the only person permitted 
to talk to me My dog, who was now grown \eiy 
old and cra/y, and had round no species to multiply 
his Jdiid upon, sat always at my right hand, and 
two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the 
other, expecting now and then a bit from niy hand, 
as a mark of special favour. 

But these wcie not the two cats which I brought 
on shore at fii-st, for they were both of them dead, 
and had been interred near iny habitation, by my 
own hand. But one of them having multiplied by 
I know not what kind of creature, these were two 
which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest lun 
wild in the w'oods, and became indeed troublesome 
to me at last , for they would often come into my 
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged 
to shoot them, and did kill a great many ; at length 
they left me. With this attendancx', and in this 
plentiful manner, I Ined ; neither could I be said to 
want aiip^tliing but society , and of that in some time 
after this, I was like to base too much.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

1 was sometliing impatient, as I have observed, to 
have the use of my boat, though very loth to run 
any more hazard:, , and theieforc sometimes I sat 
contnving ways to get her about the island, and 
at other times I sat myself down contented enough 
without her Hut I Inul a strange uneasiness in my 
mind to go down to the point of the island, where, 
as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill 
to see liow the shore lay, and how the current set, 
that I might see what I had to do. This inclina- 
tion increased upon meeieiy dav, and at length I 
I'csohed to travel thither by land, following the 
edgi- of the shore. I did so , but had any one in 
England been to meet such a man as 1 was, it must 
either have frighted them, or raised a great deal of 
laughter , and as I freijiienlly stood still to look at 
irnself, I could not but smile at the notion of iny 
traielliiig through Vorkshiie, with such an equipage, 
and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of 
mv figuie, as follows. 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat’s 
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the sun fnmi me, as to shoot the ram oft' from 
1 mining into my neck ; nothing being so hurtful in 
those climates as the ram upon the flesh, under the 
clothes 

I had a short jacket of goat-skin, the skirts coming 
dow'n to about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair 
of open-kneed breeches of the same. The breeches 
were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair 
hung down such a length on either side, that, like 
})antaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs. 
Stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me 
a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, 
like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either 
side like spatterdashes ; but of a must barbarous 
shape, as indeed were all the rest of mv clothes 

[J67] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I had on a broad belt of goat’s skin dried, which 
I drew together with two thongs of the same, instead 
of buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either side of 
this, instead of a sw’ord and a dagger, hung a little 
saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other. 
I had another belt, not so broad, and fa.stcncd in the 
same manner, which hung over my shoulder , and at 
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, 
both made of goat’s skin too; in one of which hung 
my powder, in the other my shot At my liack I 
carried my basket, on my .shoulder my gun, and over 
my head a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella, but 
which, after all, was the most necevsary thing 1 had 
about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the 
colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one 
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and 
li'iiig within nineteen degrees of the equinox. My 
beaid I had once suffered to grow till it was about a 
quarter of a yaid long, but as I had both scis.sors 
and rivors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, 
except what grew on my upper lip, which I had 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, 
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I 
saw at Sallee , for the Moors did not wear such, 
though the Turks did. Of these mustacliios or 
whiskeis, I will not say they were long enough to 
hang iiiv hat upon them, but they were of a length 
and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in Eng- 
land, would lia\e passed for frightful. 

But all this is by-the-bye ; for, as to my figure, I 
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner 
of consequence , so I say no more to that part. In 
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was 
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea- 
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my 
boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks. And 
having no boat iiow' to take care of, I went over the 
[ 168 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


land, a nearer way, to the same height that I was 
upon before ; when, looking forward to the point of 
the rocks which lay out, and which I was obligetl to 
double with my boat, as is said above, I was sur- 
pnsed to sec the sea all smooth and quiet, no rip- 
pling, no motion, no current, any moie there than in 
other places. 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and 
resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to 
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had oc-ca- 
sioned it. But I was presently convinced how it 
was, VIZ., that the tide of ebb setting from the west, 
and joining with the current of waters from some 
great river on the shore, must be the occasion of 
this current , and that ac‘c-ording as the wind blew 
more forcibly from the west, or from the north, this 
current came near, or went farthei from the shore ; 
for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to 
the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, 
I plainly saw the cun'ent again as before, onlj that 
it run farther off', being near half a league fioiii the 
shore , whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, 
and hurned me and my canoe along with it, which, 
at another time, it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing 
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of 
the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat 
about the island again. But when I began to think 
of putting it in praetice, I had sneh a terror upon 
my spints at the remembrance of the danger I had 
bwn in, that I could not think of it again with any 
patience ; but, on the contrary, I took up another 
resolution, which was more safe, though more labo- 
rious, and this was, that I would build, or rather 
make me another penctgua or canoe , and so have one 
for one side of the island, and one fur the other. 

Y on are to miderstand that now I had, as I may 

[ 169 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


call it, two plantations in the island , one, my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under 
the rock, with tlie cave behind me, which, by this 
time, I had enlarged into several apartments or 
caves, one within another. One of these, w'hicli 
was the driest and largest, and had a door out be- 
yond niy wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond 
where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up 
with the large earthen {lots, of which I have given an 
account, and with foiiiteen or fifteen great baskets, 
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I 
laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, 
some in the ear, cut off short from the straw, and 
the other rubbed out with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long .stakes 
oi piles, those piles giew aU like trees, and were by 
this tune grown so big, and .spread so very mucli, 
that there was not the least apjienraiiee, to any one's 
vicvv, of any habitation behina them 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the land, and upon lower gioimd, lay my two 
pieces of coin ground, which I kept dulv cultivated 
and sowed, and whicli duly yielded me llieir haivest 
in its season, and whenever I had occasion for more 
corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that 

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had 
now a tolerable plantation there also; foi, first, I 
had my little liower, as I called it, which I kept in 
repair , that is to say, I kept the hedge winch ended 
it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the 
ladder standing always in the inside I kept the 
trees, which at fiiwt were no more than iny stakes, 
but were now giown very firm and tall, I kept them 
always so cut, that they might spread and grow 
thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, 
which they did effectually to my mind. In the 
middle of this, I had niy tent alw'ays standing, being 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


a piece of a bail spread over polcb, set up for that 
purpose, and winch never wanted any repair or 
renewing , and under this I had made me a squab or 
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed, 
and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on 
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which 
I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me , 
and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent fiom 
my chief seat, I took up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I hatl my enclosures for my cat- 
tle, that ib to say, my goats. And as I had taken an 
inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this 
ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest 
the goats should break through, that I never left off 
till, with infinite laboui, I had stuck the outside of 
the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one 
another, that it was lathei a pale than a hedge, and 
there was scarce room to put a band through between 
them , which aftcrwanls, when those stakes grew, as 
they all did in the next rainy season, mode the en- 
closure strong like a wall, indeed, stronger than any 
wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and 
that I spaicd no pains to bring to jiass whatevei 
appeared necessai y for my comfortable support , for 
I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea- 
tures thus at mv hand would be a living magazine of 
flesh, milk, buttei,aiid cheese foi me os long as I 
lived in the place, if it were to be forty years , and 
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely 
upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, 
that I might be sure of keeping them together, 
which, by this method, indeed, I so effectually se- 
cured, that when these little .stakes began to grow, I 
had planted thtm so very thick, I was fbi'ced to pull 
some of them up again. 

In this place also I had mv grapes growing, which 

[ ni] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I principally depended on for my winter store of 
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very 
carefully, as the best and most agi'eeable dainty of 
my whole diet. And indeed they were not agreeable 
oiily, but physical, wholesome, noun.shing, and refresh- 
ing to the last degree 

As this was also about half-way between my other 
habitation and the place where I had laid up my 
boat, I generally stayeil and lay here in my way 
thither ; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and 
I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very 
good oi-dei. Sometimes I went out in hei to divert 
myself, hut no more hazardous voyages would I go, 
nor scarce ever above a stone’s cast or two from the 
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hiimed out of 
my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any 
other accident. But now I come to a new scene of 
my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going tow'aids 
my boat, I was exceeihngly surprised with the pnnt 
of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thun- 
deratriick, or as if I had seen an apparition. I lis- 
tened, I looked round me, I could heai nothing, nor 
see anything. I went up to a rising ground, to look 
farther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, 
but it w’as all one; I «»uld see no other impression 
but that one. I went to it again to see if there 
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my 
fancy , but theie was no loom for that, for there was 
exactly the very print of a foot — toes, heel, and 
every part of a foot. How it came thither I knew 
not, nor could in the least imagine But after in- 
numerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly 
eonfased and out of myself, I came home to my for- 
tification, not feeling, as we say, the giound I went 
on, but temfied to the last degree, looking behind

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush 
and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to 
be a man , nor is it possible to describe how many 
various shapes affrighted imagination represented 
things to me in, how many wild ideas were found 
every moment in my fancy, and what strange unac- 
countable whimsies came into iny thoughts by the 
way 

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called 
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued. 
Whether I went over by the ladder, as fiist contrived, 
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a 
door, I cannot remember , no, noi could I remember 
the next morning, for never frighted hare fled to 
cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of inmd than 
I to this ictreat. 

I slept none that night. The farther I was from 
the occasion of my fright, the gi-eatei my apprehen- 
sions were , which is something contiary to the nature 
of such things, and especially to the usual practice of 
all creatures in fear. But 1 was .so embarrassed with 
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed 
notliing but dismal iinaginatioiis to myself, even 
though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I 
fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in 
with me upon this supposition , for how should any 
other thing in human shape come into this place ? 
Wliere was the vessel that bi-oiight them ? What 
maiks was there of any other footsteps ^ And how 
was it possible a man should come there ^ But then 
to thiiiK that Satan should take human shape upon 
him in such a place, where there could be no iiianiiei 
of occasion for it, but to leave the piint of his foot 
behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for 
he could not bo sure I should see it , this was 
an amusement the other way. I considered tliat the 
devil might ha\ c found out abundance of other ways 
[173] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to have temfied me than this of a single print of a 
foot ; that as I lived quite on the other side of the 
island, he would never have been so simple to leave 
a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one 
whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand 
tof>, which the first .surge of the .sea, upon a high 
wind, would have defac^ entirely. All this seemed 
inconsistent with the thing itself!, and with all the 
notions we usually entertain of the suhtiltv of the 
devil. 

Abundance^ of such things as these assisted to aigue 
me out of all apprehensions of its lieing the devil , 
and I pi-eseiitly eoiuludeil then, that it must be some 
more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be some 
of the savages of the mainland over against me, who 
had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and. either 
driven by the cunents oi by contiarv winds, had 
made the island, and had been on shore, but were 

g one away again to sea, being ns loth, perhaps, to 
ave stavM in this desolate island as I would have 
been to have lu«l them 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, 
I was very thankful in my thought.s that I was so 
happv as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that 
they did not see my boat, by which they would have 
concluded that some inhabitants had been in the 
place, and peiliaps have searched faither for me 
Then terrible tlioughts racked mv iinagiiiation about 
their having found my boat, and that there were 
people here , and that if so, I should certainly have 
them come again in greater mimber.s, and devour 
me ; that if it should happen so that they should not 
find me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy 
all iny corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, 
and I should perish at last foi mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my icligious hope All 
that former confidence in Goa, which was founded 
[ 174 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


upon such wonderful experience as I had had of His 
goodness, now vanished, as if He that hod ted me by 
miracle hitherto could not preserve, by His power, 
tbe provision which He had made for me by His 
goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness, 
that would not sow any more corn ‘one year than 
would just serve me till the next season, as if no 
accident could intervene to prevent iny enjoying the 
crop that was upon the grouiul. And this I thought 
so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to 
have two or three years’ corn beforehand, so that, 
whatever might come, I might not perish for want of 
bread. 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the 
life of man * and by what secret differing springs are 
the affections hurried about as differing circum- 
stances present ' To-day we love what to-inorrow' 
we hate , to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun ; 
to-day wc desire what to-moirow we fear; nay, even 
tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exem- 
plified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner 
imaginable , for I, whose only affliction was that I 
seemed banished fioin human society, that I was 
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off 
fiom iiiaiikind, and condemned to what I called 
silent life , that I was as one whom Heaven thought 
not worthy to fie numbered among the living, or 
to appeal among the i est of His ci eatures , that to 
liave seen one of my own species would have seemed 
to me a inising me from death to life, and the 
greatest blessing that Heaven it.self, next to the 
supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow , I say, 
that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions 
of .seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the 
ground at but the shadow or silent a[)pearance of a 
man's having set his foot in the island ' 

Such is the uneven state of human life , and it 

[ 175 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ailbrded me a great many curious speculations after- 
wards, when I had a little recovered my first sur- 
prise. I considered that this was the station of life 
the infinitely wise and good providence of God hail 
determined for me ; that, as I could not forasec 
what the ends* of Divine wisdom might be in all 
this, so I was not to dispute IIis sovereigiit}, who, 
as I was His creatuic, hM an undoubtea right, by 
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as 
He thought fit, and who, as I was a creatuic who 
had offended Him, had likewise a judicial light to 
condemn me to what punishment He thouglit fit, 
and that it was my part to submit to bear IIis in- 
dignation, because I had sinned against Him. 

I then reflected that God, who was not only 
righteous, but omnipotent, as He had thought fit 
thus to punish and afflict me, so He was able to 
deliver me; that if He did not think fit to doit, 
’t was iny unquestioned duty to resign in\ self abso- 
lutely and entireN to His will , and, on the other 
hand, it was inv «uty also to hope in Him, pray to 
Him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc- 
tions of His daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, 
nay, I may say, weeks and months , and one par- 
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I 
cannot omit, viz., one morning early, lying in my 
bed, and filled with thought about my dangei from 
the appeal ance of savages, I found it discomposed 
me very much , upon which those woiris of the 
Scripture came into my thoughts, “ Call upon Me 
in the dav of tiouble, and I will deliver, and thou 
shalt glonfy Me.” 

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, 
my heart was not only comforted, but I was 
guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God 
for deliverance. When I had done praying, I took 

rne] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words 
that presented to me were, “ Wait on the Lord, and 
be of good cheer, and He shidi strengthen thy heart ; 
wait, I say, on the Lord.” It is impossible to ex- 
press the comfort this gave me. In answer, I 
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more 
sad, at least, not on that occasion 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehension.s, 
and reflections, it came into my thought one day, 
that all this might lie a mere chimera of my own ; 
and that this foot might be the pnnt of my own 
foot, when I came on shore from my boat This 
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade 
myself it was all a delusion, that it was nothing else 
but my own foot ; and why might not I come that 
wav from the boat, as well as I was going that way 
to the boat ? Again, I considered also, that I could 
by no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and 
where I had not , and that if, at last, this was only 
the print of my own foot, I had played the part of 
those fools who strive to make stones of specties and 
apparitions, and then are frighted at them more than 
anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
again, for 1 had not stirred out of my castle for 
three days and nights, so that I began to starve for 

E rovision , for I had little or nothing within doors 
ut .some barley-cakes and watei Then I knew that 
my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually 
was my evening diversion ; and the poor creatures 
were in great pain and inconvenience tor want of it ; 
and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and al- 
most dried up their milk. 

Heaitening myself, therefore, with the belief that 
this was nothing but the print of one of my own 
feet, and so I might be truly said to start at my own 
shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to 
voa 1.-12 [1T7] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

mv country house to milk my flock. But to see 
with what fear I went forwanl, how often I looked 
behind me, how I was ready, eveiy now and then, to 
lay down iny basket, and run for my life, it would 
have made any one have thought I w as haunted with 
an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most 
teriibly frighted , and so, indeed, I had. 

However, as I went down thus two oi three days, 
and having seen nothing, I began to be a little 
liolder, and to think there was really nothing in it 
but my own imagination. But I tould not persuade 
myself fullv of this till 1 should go down to the shore 
again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it bv 
my own, and see if theie was any similitude or fit- 
ness, that I might be as'-uicd it was rny own foot. 
But when I came to the place, first, it appealed evi- 
dently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could 
not possibly be on shoic anjwheie thereabouts , sec- 
ondly, when I came to measure the niaik with nij 
owU'fcKit, I found ni\ foot not so laigc h) a great 
deal. Both these things filled niy head with new 
imaginations, and gave me the vaj ours again to the 
highest degree, so that I shook with cold, like one 
in an ague ; and I went home again, filled with the 
Ixilief that some man or men bad been on shore 
there, or, in short, that the island was inhabited, 
and I might be suiprised before I was awaie. And 
what course to take for niy .secairily, I knew not. 

Oh, what iidiculous lesohition men take when 
possessed with fear! It depnves them of the use of 
those means w hieh reason ofl'ers foi then i elief The 
first thing I pioposed to myself was to thiow down 
my enclosures, and tiini all my tame ealtle wild into 
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and 
then frequent the island in prospect of the same or 
the like booty . then to the simple thing of digging 
up my two corn-fields, that they might not find such

a grain there, and still be prompted to freipient the 
island , then to demolish inv bower and tent, that 
they might not see any vestiges of habitation, aiul be 
prompted to look farther, m order to find out the 
persons inhabiting. 

These were the subjeet of the fir-.t night’s cogita- 
tion, aftei I was come home again, while the appre- 
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh 
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above 
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand tunes more 
teriifying than danger itself when apparent to the 
eyes , and we find the burthen of anxiety greater, by 
much, than the evil which we arc anxious about , 
and, which was worse than all this, I had not that 
relief ill this trouble from the resignation T used to 
practise, that I hoped to have I looked, I thought, 
like Saul, who complained not only that the I’hihs- 
tines were upon him, but that God had forsaken 
him , for I did not now take due ways to compose 
my mind, bv crying to God in iny distress, and rest- 
ing upon His piovidencc, as I had done before, 
for my defence and ileliverance , which, if I had 
done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported 
under this new surprise, and {lerhaps c-ariied tliiougii 
it with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking 
all night, but in the morning I fell asleep ; and hav- 
ing, by the aiiiusement of iiiy imnd, been, as it were, 
tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very .soundly, 
and waked much better composed than I had ever 
been befoi e. And now I began to think .sedately , 
and upon the utmost debate with iiiy.self, I concluded 
that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, 
fruitful, and no farther from the mainland than as 
I had seen, was not so entirely ahandoiicd as I might 
imagine , that although there were no stated inh^i- 
tants who. lived on the spot, yet that there might 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either 
with design, or perliaps never but when they were 
driven by cross winds, might come to this place; that 
I had li\ed here fifteen years now, and had not met 
with the least shadow or figure of an> people yet ; 
and that if at any time they should be rlnven here, 
it was probable they went away again as soon as 
evei they could, seeing they had never thought fit to 
fix there upon any occasion to this time , that the 
most I could suggest any dungci fi oni, was fioni any 
such caiiual accidental landing of straggling people 
from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were 
driven hithei, were here against their wills ; so they 
made no stay here, but went off again with all pos- 
sible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest 
they should not have the help of the tides and day- 
light liack again , and that, therefoie, I had nothing 
to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I 
should see any savages land upon the spot. 

Now I liegan sorely to repent that I had dug my 
cave .so lai'ge a.s to bring a door through again, 
which door, as I said, came out bevond wheie niy 
fortification joined to the iwk Upon maturely 
< oiisidering this, therefore, I lesolvcd to diaw me a 
second fortification, in the same iiianner of a semi- 
circle, at a distance fixin my wall, just where I had 
planted a double row of trees about twelve years 
before, of which I inaile mention These trees hav- 
ing lieen planted so thick liefore, they wanted but 
a few piles to lie driven between them, that they 
.should lie thicker and stiongcr, and ni\ wall would 
be soon finished. 

So that I hail now a double wall , and my outer 
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, 
and everything I could think of, to make it strong, 
having in it seven little holes, about a.s big as I 
might put my arm out at. In the inside of this I 
[ 180 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


thu'kened my wall to above ten feet thick, with con- 
tinual bringing earth out of my cave, and laving it 
at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; and 
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the 
muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven on 
shore out of the ship 'rhese, I say, I planted like 
my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held 
them like a carnage, that so I could fire all the 
seven guns in two minutes’ time. This wall I was 
many a weary month a-finishing, and yet never 
thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground with- 
out my wall, for a great way every way, as full with 
stakes, or sticks, of the osier-likc wood, which I found 
so apt to grow , as they could w'ell stand , insoiiuich, 
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand 
of them, leaving a pretty lai-gc space between them 
and my wall, that 1 might have room to see an erieiii} , 
and they might have no shelter from the young ti’oes, 
if they attempted to approach mv outer wall 

Thus 111 two years’ time I had a thic k grove , and 
in five or six veais’ time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that 
it was indeed perfiaitlv impassable, and no men, ot 
what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was 
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for 
the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out, 
for 1 left no avenue, it was by setting two ladders, 
one to a part of the nwk which was low, and then 
broke in, and left room to place another laddei upon 
that , so when the two laddci's were taken down, no 
man living could come down to me without niis- 
chieving himself , and it they had come down, they 
were still on the outside of iny outer wall. 

Thus I took all the iiieasiii'es human prudence could 
suggest for my own pieseivation , and it will lie seen, 
at length, that they were not altogether without just 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


reason , tlioiigh I foresaw nothing at that time more 
than in\ mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless 
of niy other affairs , for I had a great concern upon 
me for my little herd of goats. They were not onl} 
a pi’csent supply to me upon every occasion, and be- 
gan to be sufficient to mo, without the expense of 
powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of 
hunting after tlie wild ones , and I was loth to lose 
the adi antago of them, and to have them all to nurse 
up over again 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could 
think of but two wa\.s to pieseive them One was, 
to find another conieiiieiit place to dig a cave under 
ground, and to dm c them into it eiery night ; arifl the 
othei was, to enclose two oi thiee little bits of land, 
itiiiiote from one another, and as much concealed as 
I could, w here I iniglii keep aliout half-a-domi joung 
goats in each place, so that if any disastci happeneu 
to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them 
again with little tiouble and time. j\nd this, though 
it would require a gieat deal of time and labour, I 
thought was tlic most rational ilesigti 

Accordingly 1 spent some time to finii out the most 
1 etired parts of the island , and I pitched upon one 
winch was as piivate iiitlpcd as niy heart could wish 
for It was a little damp piece of giound, in the 
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
ohseived, I almost lost myself once before, endeav- 
.ouring to come back that way from the eastern 

[ lart of the island Ileie I found a cleai piece of 
and, near three acres, so surrounded with woods, 
that it was almost an enclosure by Nature ; at least, 
it did not want near so much labour to make it 
so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so 
hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
, [182] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ground, and in less than a mouth's time I had so 
fenced it round, that iny flock, or herd, call it w hich 
you please, who were not so wild now as at first they 
might be supposed to lie, weir well enough secuml 
in it. So, without any farther delay, I removed ten 
young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece. 
And when they were there, I continued to perfect 
the fence, till I had made it as secure as the other, 
which, however, I did at iiioi-e leisuis?, and it took 
me up more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely 
from my apprehensions on the account of the print 
of a man’s foot which I had seen . for, as v et, I never 
.saw any human creaturo come neai the islajid And 
I had now lived two years under these uneasines.ses, 
which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable 
than it was before, as may well be imagined by any 
who know what it is to live in the constant snare 
of the fear of man And this I must observe, with 
grief too, that the disc-omposuie of my mind had too 
gieat impressions also upon the religious part of my 
thoughts , for the dread ainl terror of falling into 
the hands of savages and cannibals l.iv so upon my 
spirits, that I seldom found m\self in a due tempei 
foi application to my Maker, at least not with the 
.sedate calmness and resignation of soul w Inch I w'as 
wont to do. I rather prayed to God as under great 
affliction and pressure Vif mind, surrounded with 
danger, and in expectation every night of being 
niunlered and devoured before inoriiiiig , and I must 
testify from my experience, that a temper of jioace, 
thankfulness, love, and affection, is much more tlie 
proper frame for prayer than that of terror and dis- 
composure ; and that under the dread of niiscliief 
impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting 
pei formaiice of the duty of praying to God, Ilian he 
is for repentance on a sick-bed For these di.scom- 
[1831 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


posures alFert the mind, a.s the others do the bod^ ; 
and the diseomposure of the nniid must necessarily 
be as great a disability as that of the body, and 
much greater, praying to God being jiioperly an act 
of the mind, not of the body. 

But to go on. After 1 had tlius .secured one part 
of iny little living stock, I went about the whole 
island, seaiching for another private place to make 
such another dofKisit ; when, wamleriiig mote to the 
west point of the island than I had e\er done yet, 
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat ujion 
the sea, at a great distance I liad found a jirospec- 
tive glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests which 
I saved out of our ship, but I had it not nlKint me , 
and this was so leinote, that I could not tell what to 
make of it, though I looked at it till niy eyes weie 
not able to hold to look any longei Whethei it was 
a boat or not, 1 do not know , but as I descendcHi fi oni 
the hill, I could see no moie of it, so I ga\e it over, 
only I resolved to go no moie out without a piospec- 
tivc glass in inv pocket. 

When I was come down the hill to the end of the 
island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was 
presently convnued that the .seeing the print of a 
man’s foot was not such a stiange thing in the island 
as 1 imagined And, but that it was a special piovi- 
dence that I was cast upon the side of the island

known that nothing was moie frequent than for the 
canot*s from the main, when they hapfiened to be a

and fought in their canoes, the victors hav ing taken

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I 
said above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was 
perfectly confounded and aina/ed, nor is it possible 
for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing 
the shore spiead with skulls, hands, feet, and other 
bones of human bodies ; and particularly, I obsci ved 
a place where there had been a lire made, and.a circle 
dug 111 the earth, like a e<K-kj>it, where it is supposed 
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman 
feastings U[)on the bodies of their fellow-ci eatures 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, 
that I entertained no notion of any danger to my- 
self from it for a long while All my appieheiisioiis 
were bulled in the thoughts of such a pitch of in- 
human, hellish brufaility, and the honor of the 
degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had 
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of 
bcfoic. Ill short, I turned away riiv face fiom the 
horrid spectiwle Mv stomach giew sick, and I was 
just at the point of fainting, when Natui e dischargt'd 
the disoidei from iiiy stoiruudi And having vomited 
with an uncoiiimon violence, I was a little relieved, 
but could not bear to stay in the place a moment ; 
so I got me lip the hill again with all the speed I 
could, and walked on tovvaids mv own hahitatiuii 

When I eanie a little out pf that pait of the 
island, I stocxl still a while, as ama/^d . and then 
recovering myself, I looked np with the utmost 
affeetion of mv soul, and with n Hood of tc'ais m mv 
eyes, gave God thanks, that had east my tn st lot in 
a part of the world where I was distinguished fi oin 
such dreadful ereatures as these, and that, though 
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, 
had yet given me so many comforts in li, that I had 
still more to give thanks foi than to (■omplain of ; 
and this above all, that I had, even m this iniseiable 
condition, been comfortcjd with the knowledge of 
[ 185 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Himself, and the hope of His blessing ; which was 
a felicity more than sufficiently eijui valent to all 
the iniseiy which I had suffered, or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my 
castle, and hegan to be much easier now, as to the 
safety of my ciifiimstanccs, than e\ei I was before; 
for I phserved that those wretches never came to 
this island in search of what they could get , per- 
haps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, 
anything here, and having often, no doubt, lieen 
up in the covered, woody part of it, without finding 
anything to their purpose. I knew I had been here 
now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least 
footsteps of human creature theie before , and I 
might be here eighteen more as entirely concealed 
a.s I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, 
which I had no manner of ocrasion to do, it being 
my only business to keep nivself entirely concealed 
where I was, unless I found a better sort of crcatuies 
than cannibals to make nnself known to 

Yet I eiitei tamed such an abhoiiencc of the 
savage wretches that I have heen speaking of, and 
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour- 
ing and eating one anothei up, that I continued pen- 
sive and sad, and kept close within my own emde 
for almost two years aftei this. When I say my 
ow II circle, I mean *l)y it my three plantations, viz , 
my castle, m\ country scat, w'hieh I called my 
bower, and my enclosure in the woods. Nor did I 
look after this foi any other use than as an enclos- 
ure for my goats , for the aversion which Nature 
gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I 
was fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil 
himself. Nor did I so iniuh as go to look after 
my boat in all this tune, but began rather to think 
of making me another ; for I could not think of ever 
making any more attempts to bring the other boat 
[ 186 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


round the island to me, lest I should meet with 
some of these creatures at sea, in winch, if I had 
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew 
what would have been my lot. 

Tune, however, and the satisfaction I had that I 
was in no danger of being discovered by these people, 
began to wear off my uneasiness about them ; and I 
began to live just in the same composed manner as 
before ; only with this difference, that I used more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I did 
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of 
them ; and particularly, I was more cautious of fir- 
ing my gun, lest any of them being on the island 
should happen to hear of it. And it was, therefore, 
a very good providence to me that I had furnished 
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed 
not hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at 
them. And if I did catch any of them after thi.s, it 
was by traps and snares, as I had done before ; so 
that for two years after this I believe I never fired 
my gun once oft', though I never went out without 
it , and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols 
out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, 
or at least tw'o of them, sticking them in my goat- 
skin belt. Also I furbished up one of the great cut- 
lasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt 
to put it on also ; so that I was now a most formida- 
ble fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add 
to the former description of myself the particular of 
two pistols and a great broadsword hanging at my 
side in a belt, but without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some 
time, I seemed, ex epting these cautions, to be re- 
duced to my former calm, sedate way of living All 
these things tended to showing me, more and more, 
how far my condition was from being miserable, 
compared to some others , nay, to many other par-

ticulars of lift*, whith it nnglit ha\c pleased God to 
have made mv lot. It put me upon lefleeting how 
little repining there would be among mankind at 
any eondition of life, if people would rather coiiiparc 
their eondition with those that are worse, in order 
to lie thankful, than be alwajs eoinparing them with 
those which arc better, to assist their niurmiinngs 
and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really 
ni.any things whith I wanteil, so indeetl I thought 
that the fiiglits I had licen in about these savage 
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own 
preserv'ation, had taken off' the <slgo of my invention 
for mv own conveniences And I had dropped a 
good design, which I had once bent ni_v tlioiights too 
niucb upon , and that was, to trv if I could not 
make some of nij barlev into malt, and then try to 
brew myself some beei nils was icalJy a whimsical 
thought, and I reproved mv.sclf often foi the simpli- 
city of it ; for I presently .saw* tliere would be the 
want of several things necessary to the making my 
beer, that it would be impossible for me to sujiply. 
As, fimt, casks to picsorve it in, which was a thing 
that, as I have observed aheady, I could never com- 
pass , no, though I sfient not niaiiv davs, but weeks, 
nay, months, in attempting it, but to no puipftse 
In the next place, I hiul no hops to make it keep, no 
yeast to make it woik, no copper or kettle to make 
it boil ; and yet all tlu'sc things notwithstanding, I 
verily believe, had not these things inteneneil, I 
mean the flights and terrors I was in about the sav- 
ages, I hod undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to 
pass too, fori seldom gave anv thing over without 
accomplishing it when I once had it m my head 
enough to begin it 

But niy invention now run quite another way; 
for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how 
[1881 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I might destroy some of these monsters in their 
cruel, bloody entei tainment, and, if possible, save 
the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It 
would take up a larger volume than this whole work 
is intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I 
hatched, or mther bnaided upon, in my thought, for 
the destroying these creatures, or at least frighting 
them so as to prevent their coming hither any more. 
But all was abortive , nothing could be possible to 
take effect, unless I was to be tliere to do it myself. 
And what could one man do among them, when 
perhaps theie might be twenty or thirty of them to- 
gethei, with their darts, oi their bows and arrows, 
with winch they could shoot as true to a mark as I 
could with my gun ? 

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the 
place where they made their fiie, and put in live or 
six pound of gunpowdei, which, when they kindled 
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow 
up all that was near it. But as, m the first place, 
I should be very loth to w'aste so much powder upon 
them, my store being now within the quantity of 
one band, so neither could I be sure of its going 
off at any certain time, when it might surpnse them ; 
and, at best, that it would do little more than just 
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but 
not sufficient to make them forsake the place. So I 
laid it aside, and then proposed that I would place 
myself in ambush in some convenient place, with 
my three guns all double-loaded, and, in the middle 
of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I 
should he sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three 
at every shot ; and then falling in upon them with 
iny three pistols and niy sword, I made no doubt 
but that if there was twenty I should kill them all. 
This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks; 
and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, 
[ 189 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at 
them in my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my imagination, that I 
«*mploye(i myself several, days to find out proper 
places to put myself in anibuscade, as I said, to 
watch foi them , and I went frequently to tlie place 
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me ; 
and especially while my mind was thus filled with 
thoughts of ri'venge, and of a bloody jnitting twenty 
or thirty of tliem to the sword, as I ma\ call it, the 
horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the 
barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated 
my malice 

Well, at length 1 found a place in the side of the 
lull, wheiv I was satisfiwl I might securely w'ait till 
I saw any of then boats coming, and might then, 
even before they would lx; leadv to come on shore, 
convey myself, unven, into thickets of trees, in one 
of which fhcix; was a hollow large enough to conceal 
me entirely , and wheie I might sit and observi* all 
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at then 
heads, when they were so close togethci, as that it 
would lx; next to impossible that I should miss my 
shot, or that I could fail wounding tliiee or four of 
them at the fii-st shot 

111 this place, then, I resolved to fix iny design , 
and, accordingly, I pre|Mued two muskets and my 
oiidinan fowliiig-pioce. The two muskets I loaded 
with a brace of slugs each, and four or fiie smaller 
bullets, alxiut tlie .size of pistol-bullets , and the 
fow ling-piece I loailed with iieui a handful of swan- 
shot, of tlie lalge^t si/c. 1 also loadcsl my pistols 
with about four bullets each, and in this postuie, 
well pro\ided with ammunition for a second and 
third charge, I piepaied myself for my expedition 

After I had thus laid the scheme of mv design, and 
in my imagination put it in practice, I contimmllv 
[190J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


made my tour every morning up to the top of the 
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about 
three miles, or moi'e, to see if I could observe any 
boats upon the sea coming near the island, or stand- 
ing over towards it. But I began to tire of this 
hard duty, after I had, for two or three months, 
constantly kept my watch, but came always back 
without any discoveiy , there having not, in all that 
tune, been the least apfiearaiue, not only on or near 
the shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my 
eyes or gla.sses could reach everv way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to 
look out, so long also 1 kept up the vigour of my 
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in 
a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as 
the killing twenty oi thirty naked savages for an 
offence which I had not at all entered into a dis- 
cussion of 111 niy thoughts, any farther than iny 
passions were at nist fired by tlie horror I conceived 
at the uiiiiatural custom of that people of the 
country ; who, it seems, had been suftered by Piovi- 
dence, in His w'isc disposition of the world, to have 
no other guide than that of their own abominable 
and Mtiated passions ; and consequently were left, 
and perhaps had been so for .some ages, to act such 
horiid things, and receive such dreadful cu.stoms, as 
nothing but nature entirely abandoned of Heaven, 
and acteil by some hellish degeneracy, could have 
run them into. But nosy when, as I have said, I 
began to be weary of the fi’uitlcss excursion which 
I bail made so long and so far every morning in 
vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to 
alter, and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, 
to consider what it was I was going to engage in. 
What authoiity or call I had to pretend to be judge 
and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom 
Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, 
[ 191 ] 



rtOBIN’SON CRUSOE 

unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the exe- 
cutioners of Tils judgment.s one upon another. How 
far these people m ere oftendera against me, and what 
right I had to engage in the quairel of that blood 
which they shed piutiiiscuously one upon another 
I debated this \ei\ often with myself, thus How 
do I know what God Himself judges in this parti- 
cular ea.sc S' It is ceitain these people either do not 
eoiiiiint this a-, a crime, it is not against their own 
eoiiseieiiee-,’ lepro^ing, oi then light reproaelniig 
them 'I'licy do not know it to be an offenec, and 
flien eonnnit ii in deliaiic'e of Dicitie justice, as we 
do in almost all the siiia we eoiiiiiiit. They think it 
no inoi-e a crime to kill a enptue taken in war, than 
we do to kill an ox , iioi to eat human flesh, than 
we do to eat mutton 

When I had eonsideied this a little, it followed 
necessarily that I was certainly ni the wiong in it, 
that these people were not iminleiein in the sense 
that ! hud before coiideiiined them ni my thoughts, 
any nioie than those Chi istiaiis were murderers who 
often put to death the piisoiieis taken in battle , or 
more fieipieiith, ujion many cK-easions, put whole 
tioops of men to the swoid, without gi\ mg quarter, 
though they thiew down their arms and submitted. 

Ill the next place it ocx-uiied to me, that albeit 
the usage they thus gace one anothei w.is thus hi utish 
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me , these 
people had done me no iiijuiv I'kat if they at- 
tempted me, or I saw it necessary foi my immediate 
preservation to fall u|m»ii them, something might be 
said for it , but that as I was yet out of their power, 
and they had really no knowledge of me, and con- 
sequently no design upon me, and theicd'oicit could 
not be just for me to fall upon them. That this 
would justify the cxinduct of the Spaniaixls in all 
the’r barbarities piaetiscxi in America, and wheie

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

they destroyed millions of these people ; who, how- 
ever they were idolaters and barbarians, and had 
several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, 
such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were 
yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people ; and 
that the rooting them out of the country is spoken 
of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by 
even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by 
all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere 
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, 
uujustinable either to Gk>d or man ; and such, as 
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned 
to be frightful and tcinble to all people of human- 
ity, or of Christian compassion , as if the kingdom 
of Spain were particularly eminent for the product 
of a race of men who «eie w-ithout principles of 
tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the 
miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of geii- 
cious temper in the mind. 

These considerations I'eally put me to a pause, and 
to a kind of a full .stop , and I began, by little and 
little, to be oft' of my design, and to conclude I had 
taken wrong measures in niy lesolutions to attack the 
savages; that it was not iny business to meddle with 
them, unless they fiist attacked me , and this it was 
my business, if possible, to pi’evciit ; but that if I 
were discovered and attacked, then I knew my 
duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with in>self that this 
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely 
to ruin and destroy myself, for unless I was sure to 
kill every one that not only .should be On shoie at 
that time, but that should ever come on shore after- 
wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their coun- 
try people what had happened, they would come over 
again by thousands to revenge the death of their 
fellows, and I .should only bring upon myself a cer- 
vou I — 13 [ 193 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


tain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner 
of occasion for. 

Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in prin- 
ciples nor in policy I ought, one way or other, to 
concern myself in this affair. That my business was, 
by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, 
and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by 
that there were any living cieatures upon the island , 
I mean of human shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was 
convinced now, inany ways, that I was jicrfectlv out 
of my duty when I was laying all nij bloody schemes 
for the destruction of innocent creatures ; I mean 
innocent as to me. As to the ci lines they were guilt v 
of towards one anothei, I had nothing to do witli 
them. ITiey were national, and I ought to leave 
them to the justice of Go<l, who is the Governor of 
nations, and knows how, by national pniiishinents, to 
make a just retribution for national offences, and to 
bring public judgments upon those wlio ofleiul in a 
public iiianiier by such wavs as best pleases Him 

This appeared .so clear to me now, that nothing was 
a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been 
suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much rea- 
son to lielieve would have lieen no less a sin than that 
of wilful murder, if I had committed it. And I gave 
most humble thanks on ..ly knees to God, that had 
thus delivered me f'loni blood-guiltincss , beseeching 
Him to grant me the protection of His providence, 
that I might not fall into the hands of the bar- 
barians, or that I might not lav my hands upon them, 
unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, 
in defence of my own life 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after 
this ; and so far was 1 from desiring an occasion for 
falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I 
never once went up the hill to see whether there were 
L194] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


any of them in sight, or to know whether any of 
them had been on shore there or not, that I might 
not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances 
against them, or be provoked, by any advantage 
which might pi’esent itself, to fall upon them. Only 
this I did, I went and I'emoved my boat, which I htul 
on the other side the hsland, and carried it down to 
the east end of .the whole island, where I ran it 
into a little cove, which I found under some high 
rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, 
the savages durst not, at least would not come, with 
their boats, upon any account whatsoever. 

With my Doat I carried away everything that I 
had left theie belonging to her, though not neces- 
sary for the bare going thither, viz., a mast and sail 
which I had made for hei, and a thing like an 
anchor, but indeed which could not be called either 
anchor or grappling ; however, it was the best I could 
make of its kind. All these I removed, that there 
might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or 
any appearance of any boat, or of any human habita- 
tion, upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re- 
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other 
than upon my constant employment, viz., to milk 
my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the 
wood, which, ns it was quite on the other part of 
the i.sland, was (juite out of danger ; for certain it is, 
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted 
this island, never came with any thoughts of finding 
anything here, and consequently never wandei'ed off 
from the coast, and I doubt not but they might 
have been several times on shore after my appre- 
hen.sions of them had made me cautious, as well as 
before ; and indeed, I looked b-aek with some horror 


upon the thoughts of what my condition would have 
b^n if I had chopped upon them and heen dis-

covered before that, when, naked and unarmed, ex- 
cept with one gun, and that loaded often only with 
small shot, I walked eveiy where, peeping and peep- 
ing about the island to see what I could get. What 
a surprise should I have liec-n in if, when I disi-ovei’ed 
the punt of a 11^11^ finit, I had, instead of that, 
seen tifteeii or twenty vivages and found them pur- 
suing me, and by the swiftness of their running, no 
possibility of my escaping them * 

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very 
soul witliin me, and distressed my mind so much, 
that I could not soon letover it, to think what I 
should have done, and how I not only should not 
have been able to lesist them, but even should not 
have had presence of mind enough to do what I 
might have done, much less what now, after so much 
considciation and piefiaration, I might lx* able to 
do Indeed, aftei serious thinking of these things, 
I should bo very melancholy, and somef lines it would 
last a great while, but I lesolved it, at l.ist, all into 
thankfulness to that Piovidence which had deliveicd 
me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me 
from those mischiefs which I could no way havebc'cn 
the agent in delivering myself fioni, In'caiise I had 
not the least notion of an\ such thing depending, 01 
the least supjwsition of it heing possible. 

This renewed a conttmplation which often had 
eome to inv thoughts in fonnei time, when first I 
began to sec the merciful dispositions of Heaven, 111 
the dangers we run through in tins life. How won- 
dci fully w'e are deliveied when we know nothing of 
it. How', when wc are in a quandaiy, as we call it, 
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or 
that way, a secret hint shall direct us this wav, wlieii 
we intended to go that way , tiav, when sense, oiii 
own inclination, and jieiliaps business, lias called to 
go the other w'ay, yet a straiijje impression upon the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


mind, from we know not what springs, and by we 
know not what power, shall overrule us to go this 
way ; and it shall afterwaixls appear, that had we 
gone that way which we should have gone, and even 
to our imagination ought to have gone, we should 
have been ruined and lost. Upon tliesc and many 
like reflections I afterwards m^e it a ceitain lule 
with me, that whenevei I found those secit't hints or 
pressings of my mind to doing, or not doing, any- 
thing that presented, or to going this way or that 
way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate, though 
I knew no other ixaison for it than that such a pres- 
sure, or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could 
give many examples of the success of this conduct in 
the course of my life, but more especially in the 
latter part of niy inhabiting this unhappy island , 
besides many occasions which it is very likely I 
might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the 
same eyes then that I saw with now. But’t is ncvei 
too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all 
considenng men, whose lives are attended with such 
extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not 
so extraonlinary, not to slight such seci’et intima- 
tions of Providence, let them come from what in- 
visible intelligence they will. UTiat I shall not 
discuss, and perhaps cannot account for, but cei- 
tainly they are a pioof of the converse of spiiits, and 
the secret communication between those embodied 
and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never 
lie withstood, of which I shall have occasion to give 
some very remarkable instances in the lemaiiidei of 
my solitary residence in this dismal place. 

I believe the leader of this will not think strange 
if I confess that these anxieties, these conslant dangers 
I lived in, and the conceni that was now upon me, 
put an end to all invention, and to all the contriv- 
ances that I had laid for my future accommodations

and conveniences. I had the care of niy safety more 
now upon my hands than that of my food I cared 
not to diive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, foi 
fear the noise I should make should be heard , much 
less would I fire a gun, for the same rea.son , and, 
above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, 
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance 
in the diw, should betray me , and for tins reason 
I removed that jiart of my bu^llless which required 
fire, such as burning of pots and Jiipes, tfcc., into niy 
new apartment in the woods . where, after I had been 
some tune, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a 
mere natural cave in tlie earth, whuh went in a vast 
wav, and wlieiv, I dare s.iv, no savage, had he been 
at the mouth of it, would Ix' so haidy as to venture

like me, wanted nothing so nnieli as a safe retreat 

The mouth of this hallow was at the bottom of a

I did' not see abundant leasoii to aseiibe all such

thick branches of tree's to make cbareoal , and 
before I go on, 1 must oliscive the reason of my

tion, as I sai.l liefore , and >et I eoulci not live there 
without baking nij bread, cooking my meal, So 
I contrived to burn some vvikxI lieic, ns I had seen 
done 111 England under turf, till it beeame ehark, or 
dry coal , and then putting the fire out, I preserved 
the coal to caii\ home, and jH'ifoim the other ser- 
vices which fire was wanting foi at home, without 
danger of smoke 

But this IS by-thc-bye. While I was cutting down 
some wood here, I ix'reeived that behind a very thick 
branch of low hiushwood, oi underwood, there was a 
kind of hollow place 1 vv,-».s curious to look into it . 
[198] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large ; that is to say, sufficient for 
me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with 
me. But I must confess to you I made more haste 
out than I did in when, looking farther into the 
place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad 
shining eyes of some cieature, whether devil or man 
I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim 
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and 
making the reflection. 

However, after some pause I recovered myself, 
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell 
myself that he that was afmid to see the devil was 
not fit to live twenty yeivn, in an island all alone, 
and that I dui'st to believe there was nothing in 
this cave that was more frightful than myself. 
Upon this, plucking up my couiagc, I took up a 
great firebiaiid, and in I rushed again, with the 
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three 
steps in, but I was almost as much frighted as I was 
hefore , for I heaul a very loud sigh, like that of a 
man in .some pain, and it was followed by a broken 
noise, ns if of words half expressed, and then a deep 
sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck 
with such a surpnse, that it put me into a cold 
sweat; and if I hml had a hat on my head, I will 
not answer for it, that my hair might not have 
lifted it oft' But still plucking up my spirits as 
well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with 
considering that the power and presence of God was 
everywhere, and was able to protect me, upon this 
I stepped foiward again, and hy the light of the 
firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw 
lying on the ground a most monstrous, fnghtful, old 
he-^iat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping 
for life , and dj ing, indeed, of mere old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, 

[ 199 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and he essayed to get up, but wie. not able to raise 
himself; and I thought with iti\self he might even 
he there, for if he liad friglited me so, he would 
certainly fright anv of the savages, if any of them 
should be so haivly as to tome m there while he had 
any life in him. 

I was now lecoverod fiom my surprise, and began 
to look loimd me, when I fount! the cave was but 
very small ; that Is to say, it might be about twelve 
tcet over, but in no iiiannei of shape, either lound or 
s(|uare, no hands having ever been employed in mak- 
ing it but thost* of nieie Nature I obseived also 
that there was a pl.iee tit the fai ther side of it that 
went in fartiier, but w.i-. so low, that it reijuired me 
to creep upon mv hanils anil knees to go into it, and 
whither I went I knew not , so having no candle, I 
gave it over foi some tiiiu. but lescnved to come 
again the next dai, piovidcsl with candles and a 
tiiider-box, which I had made of the lock of one of 
the muskets, with some wild fiie in the pan 

Aceordiiiglv, the next day I (.line piovuled with 
six laige candle’s of mv own making, for I made verv 
gooil candles now of go it’s tallow , and going into 
this low place, I was obliged to ciecp upon all fours, 
as I have said, almost ten yatds, whudi, by the way, 
I thouglil was a venture laild enough, considering 
that I knew not liow fai it might go, nor what was 
iK’yoiid it. When I was got through the strait, I 
found the roof lOsc higher up, I believe near twenty 
feet. But never wtis such a glorious sight seen in 
the island, I d.iie say, as it was. to look round the 
sides and roof of this vault oi cave . the walls icfleetcd 
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two can- 
dles. What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, 
or any other pieeioiis stones, or gold, which I rather 
supposed it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


or grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though 
perfectly dark. The floor was di’y and level, and 
liad a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there 
was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen ; 
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or 
roof. The only difficulty in it was the enti'ance, 
which, however, as it was a place of security, and 
such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a 
convenience, so that I was leally rejoiced at the 
discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring 
some of those things which I was most anxious about 
to this place , particularly, I resolved to bring hither 
niy magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz., 
two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all, and three 
muskets, for of them I had eight in all. So I kept 
at my castle only five, wliicli stood ixiady-mounted, 
like pieces of cannon, on niy outmost fence , and were 
ready also to take out upon any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, 
I took occasion to open the barrel of powder, which 
I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet ; 
and I found that the vvatei had penetrated about 
thiee or four inches into the powder on every side, 
which caking, and growung hiiid, had preserved the 
inside like a keinel in a shell , so that I had near 
sixty pounds of vciy giMid powder in the centre of 
the cask. And this was an agreeable discovery to 
me at that time, so I earned all away thither, 
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder 
with me 111 my castle, for fear of a surprise of any 
kind. I also earned thither all the lean I had left 
for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient 
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes' in 
the rocks, whei’e none could come at them , for I 
persuaded my.self, while I was here, if five hundred 
savages were to hunt me, they could never find me

out , or, if they did, they would not venture to at- 
tack^'me heie 

llie old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the 
mouth of tile cave tiic next day after I made this 
discovery : and I found it much easier to dig| a great 
hole there, and throw liini in and cover him with 
earth, than to drag him out , so I intcired him 
there, to prevent tlie offence to my nose 

I was now in my twciity-tlnrd year of residence in 
this island , and was so naturalised to the place, and 
to the manner of living, that could I have but en- 
joyed the certainty that no savages would come to 
the place to distiiih me, I coiilfl liave lieen content 
to have capitulated foi s|)cnding the icst of m\ time 
there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me 
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had 
also arrived to some little diversions and amuse- 
ments, which madv‘ the time pass more pleasantly 
with me a great deal than it did bcfoic As, first, I 
had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak , 
and he did it so familiailv, and talked so articulately 
•and plain, that it was veiy pleasant to me, and ho 
lived with me no less than six and twentv'^ vears 
How long he might live afterwards I know^ not. 
though I know they have a notion in the Iha^ils 
that they live a hundred vears. Perhaps poor Poll 
may be alive there still, < dling aftei jiooi Robin 
Crusoe to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill 
luck to come there and hear him , but if he did, he 
would certainly believe it was the devil My dog 
was a very pleasant and loving companion to me foi 
no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died 
of mere old age. A's for my cats, thev multiplied, 
os I have observed, to that degiee, that I was obliged 
to shout several of them at first to keep them from 
devouring me and all I had ; but at length, when 
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

after some time continually driving them ftom me, 
and letting them have no proviMon with me, they 
all ran wild into the woods, except two or three fa- 
vourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when 
they had any, I always drowned , and these were 
part of my family. Besides these, I always kept 
two or three household kids about me, whom I 
taught to feed out of my hand. And I had two 
more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would 
all call “ Robin Crusoe,” but none like my first , 
nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them 
that I had done with him. I had also several tame 
sea-fowls, whose names I know not, whom I caught 
upon the shore, and cut their wings , and the little 
stakes which I had planted befoiv my castle wall be- 
ing now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls 
all lived among these low tresis, and bred there, 
which was very agreeable to me , so that, as I said 
above, I began to be very vvell cimtented with the 
life I led, if it might but have been secured from the 
dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed , and it ma^ not be 
amiss for all people who shall meet with niy story, 
to make this just observation from it, viz., how fre- 
quently, in the course of our lives, the evil w'hicli in 
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are 
fallen into it, is the most dreadful to us, is often- 
times the veiy means or dooi of our deliverance, by 
which alone we can be raised again from the afflic- 
tion we are fallen into. I could give many examples 
of this m the course of my unaccountable life , hut 
111 nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than 
in the circumstances of my last years of solitary 
residence in this island' 

It was now the month of December, as I said 
above, in iny twenty-third year ; and this, Iieing 
the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it),

was the particular tune of luy harvest, and required 
my being pietty nuich abroiul in tlie fields, when, 
going out pretty early in the inoimng, even before 
it was thorougli daylight, I was sui prised with see- 
ing a light of some /ire iijkhi the shore, at a distance 
from me of about tw o miles, low aids the end of the 
island, where I had observed some savages had been, 
as behire. But not on the other side , but, to my 
great affliction, it was on in\ side of the island 

I was indeed terribly suipiised at the sight, and 
step|X‘d short within my grove, not daring to go 
out, lest I might Ik* surprised ; and > ct 1 had no 
more peace wilhin, fioiii the appieheiisioris I had 
that if these savages, in rambling ovei the island, 
should find my corn standing oi cut, or any of my 
woiks and nnpiovenieiits, thes would iimnediately 
conclude that theic were {leoiile in the place, and 
would tlieii never give ovei till thev had found me 
out. In this extreinifv I went baciv directly to my 
castle, pulled up the iaddei after me, anil made 
all things without look .is wild and natural as I 
could 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in 
a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I 
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were 
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my 
{listols, and resolved to <l*‘fcnd nivself to the last 
gasp, not foi getting seiiouslv to connnend mvself 
to the Divine protection, and earnestiv to piay to 
God to deliver me out of the hands of the hw- 
barians. And in this posture I eontinued about 
two hours, but began to be miglity impatient for 
intelligence abroad, foi I had no spies to send 
out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I 
should do in this ease, I was not able to bear sitting 
in Ignorance any longer, so setting up my ladder

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

to the side of the hill where there was a flat place, 
as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up 
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top 
of the hill ; and pulfing out my perspective-glass, 
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat 
on niv belly on the ground, and began to look for 
the place. I presently found there was no less than 
nine naked savages sitting round a small Are they 
had made, not to wai m them, fur they had no need 
of that, the weather being exti-eine hot, but, as I 
supposed, to dicss some of their barbarous diet of 
human flesh which they had brought with them, 
whcthei alive or dead, I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the shoi-c , and as it was then tide 
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return 
of the flood to go away again. It is not ea.Hy to 
imagine wliat confusion this sight put me into, es- 
pecially seeing them come on my side the island, and 
.so near me too. But when I obsei ved their coming 
must be always w ith the cunent of the ebb, I began 
afterwards to be more sedate in niy mind, being sat- 
isfied that I might go abroad with safety all the 
time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore 
befoie; and having made this observation, I went 
abroad about my harvest-work with the more 
com{)osure. 

As I expected, so it proved , for as soon as the tide 
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and 
low (or paddle, as we call it) all away, I should have 
obsei ved, that for an hour and more before they went 
off, they went to dancing ; and I could easily discern 
their postures and gestures by niy glasses. I could 
not jierceive, by my nicest obrervation, but that they 
were stark naked, and had not the lea.st covering upon 
them , but whether they were men or women, that I 
could not distinguish. 

[ 205 ] 



ROBINSON CRrsOE 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took 
two guns upon nij slioulders, and two pistols at my 
giitlle, and iny great swonl by niy side, without a 
scabbaiil, uml with all the sjieed I was able to make I 
went away to the hill where I had discos eicd the first 
appearance of all And as sikmi as I gat thither, 
wmich was not less than two hams (for I could not go 
apace, l)c“ing soloden with arms as I was), I perceived 
there had Ir'cii tliiee tanoes more of savages on that 
place, and looking out faithei, I saw thc\ were all 
at sea togethei, making ovei foi the main 

'Phis was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, 

t joiiig down to the shoie, I eoiild see the marks of 
loiTor which the dismal w'oik they had been about 
had left b<-hind it, vi/ , the blood, the bones, and part 
of the flesh of huiiiaii bodies, eaten and devoumi by 
those wretches with lueinmeiit and sjiort I was so 
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now 
to premeditate ttie destruction of the next that I saw 
theie, let them be wlio oi how many soever 

It seemed CMdent to me that the visits which the> 
thus made to tins island are not veiy frequent, for it 
was above fifteen uionths befoie ain nioie of them 
came on shoie there again , that is to sa\, I iicithei 
saw them, or ain tbotstejis or signals of them, in all 
that time , for, as to the rainy seasons, then the^ aic 
sure not to come ahioad, 1 1 least not so far. Yet 
all this while 1 lived uneoiiitbrtablv , by reason of the 
constant appiehensions I was in of then coining upon 
me by surprise, from vvhencre I observe, that the 
expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, 
especially if there is no rcMim to shake off that ex- 
pectation, or those apprehensions 

During all this time I was in a min dering humour, 
and took up most of my hours, which should have 
been better cniploved, lu contnving how to eireum- 
vent and fall upon them the very next time I should

see them ; especially if they should be divided, as 
they were the last tune, into two parties. Nor did I 
consider at all that if I killed one party, suppose ten 
or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or 
month, to kill another, and so another, even ad nMni- 
turrif till I should be at length no less a muruerer 
than they were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much 
more so. 

I spent iny days now in great perplexity and anxi- 
ety of mind, expecting that I should, one day or other, 
fall into the hands of these merciless creatures ; and 
if I did at any tune vcntuie abroad, it nas not with- 
out looking round me with the greatest care and 
caution iinaginable And now I found, to my great 
comfort, how happy it was that I provided for a tame 
flock or herd of goats , for I dui st not, upon any 
account, fire my gun, especially near that side of the 
island whore they usually came, lest I should alarm 
the savages. And if they had fled from me nou, I 
was sure to have them come back again, with per- 
haps two or three hundml canoes with them, in a 
few days, and then 1 knew what to expect. 

However, T w'ore out a year and three months 
nioie hefoie I evci saw any more of the savages^ and 
then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It 
is time they might have been there once or twice, but 
cither they made no stay, or at least I did not hear 
them , but in the month of May, as near as I csnild 
calculate, and in my foui and twentieth year, I had 
a very strange encounter with them ; of which in its 
place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen 
or sixteen iiiontiis’ interval, was very great. I slefit 
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
started out of my sleep in the night. In the day 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind, and in the 
night I dreaiijed often of killing the savages, and of

the reasons why I might justify tlie doing of it. But, 
to waive all this foi a while, it tt.is in the middle of 
May> oil the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my 
poor woollen ealendiu would ictkon, for I marked 
all upon the jiost stiM , I sav, it was the sixteenth of 
May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, 
w'lth a gieat deal of hghtniiig and thunder, itnd a very 
foul night it was after it I know not what was the 
particular oei-asion of it, but as I was reading in the 
Bible, and taken up with vciy seiioiis thoughts about 
iiiy present condition, 1 was surpiised with a noise of 
a gun, as I thought, finsl at s«‘a 

This was, to lie sure, a surprise of a quite diffeivnt 
iiatuie fioiii any I had met with Ixdbit; , for the 
notions this put into my thoughts weie quite of 
another kind. I staiteil up in the gieatest haste 
imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the 
luidclle plaeeof the lock, and pulled it aftci me , and 
inouiitiug it the second tune, got to tin* (op of the 
hill the veiy iiionieiit that a flash of (iie hid me listen

iiiiiuite, I heard , and, b\ the sound, knew that it 
was fiom that part of llie sea whci-c I was diivcii 
down the cuiient in my Ixiat. 

I iiiimedialely coiisulertsf that thi.s must be some 
ship 111 chstiess, and that they had .some comrade, or 
some othei ship in eoiiipaiit, and fired these* guns for 
signals of chstiess, and to obtain lii'lp I had thi.s 
pieseiiec of mind, at that minute, as to think that 
though I < mild not help them, it may be they might 
help me ; so I brought togethei all the dry wood I 
could gc't at hand, and, making a good handsome

ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and 
after that several others, all from the same quarter. 
I plied my di'e all night long till day broke ; and 
when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw 
something at a great distance at sea, ftill east of the 
island, whether a sail or^a hull I could not distinguish, 
no, not with m3 glasses, the distance was so great, 
and the weather still something hazy also ; at least it 
was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con- 
cluded that it w’as a ship at an anchor. And being 
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my 
gun in my hand and ran toward the south side of the 
island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried 
away with the current, and getting up there, the 
weather by this time being pei-fcctly clear, I could 
plainly see, to niy great sorrow, the wieck of a ship, 
cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks 
which I found when I was out in my boat; and 
which rocks, as they chec-keil the violence of the 
stream, and made a Kind of counter-stream or eddy, 
weie the occasion of my retovering from the most 
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had lieen in 
HI all my life 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man’s 
destruction ; foi it seems these men, wh(X-ver they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks 
being wholly under water, had bei'ii driven upon them 
in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.B. 
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup- 
pose they did not, they must, as I thought, have 
endeavoured to have saved themselv'es on shore by 
the help of their boat ; but their firing of guns for 
help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, ray 
fire, filled me with many thoughts First, I imagined 
that upon seeing my light, they might have put

themselves into their boat, and have endeavoured to 
make the shore , but that the sea going very high, 
they might lia\e been east away Other times I 
imagined that they iniglit ha\c lost then boat be- 
fore, as might 1 k‘ the case many ways, as, particu- 
larly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, 
which many times obliges men to stave, or take ni 

E icces their boat, and sometimes to throw it ovei- 
oaixl with their own hands Other times I imagined 
they had some other ship or ships m companv, who, 
upon the signals of distress they had made,' had taken 
I hem up and earned them off’. Othei whiles 1 
fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, 
and iMiing huiiied away by the current that I had 
been foimerly in, were earned out into the gri'at 
ocean, wheie tbeiv was nothing but miserv and perish- 
ing, and that, perhaps they might by this time 
think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat 
one another 

As all these w'crc but conicetures at best, so, in 
the condition I was in. I could do no more than look 
on upon the misery of the poor ineii, and pity them , 
which had still this giKnl eff’ect on my side, that it 
gave me more and inoie cause to give thanks to God, 
who had so happily and comfoitahly piovidcsl for me 
111 niy desolate condition, and that of two ships’ 
companies who vvciv now ca-st away upon this part of 
the woild, not one life should lie spaied hut mine 
1 learned here again to obseivc, that it is very rare 
that the providence of God casts us into any condi- 
tion of life so low, or any imscry so gicat, but we 
may see sometliing or other to be thankful for, and 
may see othcis, in worse ciicunistances than our own 
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom 
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of 
them were .saved Nothing could make it rationm so 
much as to wish or expect that thev did not all nensh

there, except the possibility only of their being taken 
up by another ship in company , and this was but 
mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sig- 
nal or appearance of any such thing. 

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, 
what a strange lunging or hankering of desires I felt 
in my soul upon this sight, bi'eakiiig out sometimes 
thus : “ Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, 
or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped 
to me, that I might but have had one companion, one 
fellow-ci-eature, to ha\e s|M>ken to me, and to ha\e 
convci-sed with ' ” In all the time of my .solitary life, 
I never felt so earnest, so stnmg a desire after the 
society of my fellow-ei-eatui-es, or so deep a regret at 
the want of it 

Tliere aie some secret moving springs in the affec- 
tions which, when they are set agoing oy some object 
in view, oi Ik; it some ob|c<-t, though not in view, 
yet reiideied present to the mind by the power of 
imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its 
impetuosity to such violent, eager enibiacings of the 
object, that the absence of it is insuppoitable. 

Such were these earnest wishings that but one man 
had been saved ' “ Oh that it had been but one ' ” 

I belie\ e I repeated the words, “ Oh that it had been 
one ' ” a thousand times ; and the desires were so 
moied by it, that when I spoke the words my hands 
would clinch together, and iny fingers press the palms 
of my hands, that if I had had any .soft thing in my 
hana, it would have crushed it involuntarily , and my 
teeth in my head would .stnke together, and set 
against one another so strong, that for some time 1 
could not part them again 

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the 
reason and manner of them. All I can say to them 
is to describe the fact, which was even surprising 
to me when I found it, though I knew not from

what it should proceed. It whs doubtless the effect 
of ardent wishes, and of strong uKms foi med in my 
mind, realising the comfort winch the conversation 
of one of my fcllow-Chnshans would have been to 
me. 

But it wa.s not to be. Either then fate or mine, 
or both, forbid it, for, till the last u-ar of iiiy being 
on this island, I neiei knew whethei aii\ were .saved 
out of that ship or no ; and had onlv the affliction, 
.some days aftci, to .see the ctnpse ot a diowued boy 
come on shore at the end of the ishuul whith was 
next the sbipwieck He had on no clothes but a 
seaman's waistcoat, a jiair of open-kneed linen draw ers, 
and a blue linen shut, but nothing to duett me so 
much os to guess what nation he was of He had 
nothing in his pocket but two pieces t)f eight and a 
tobacco-pipe The last was to me of ten times iiioie 
value than the fiist 

It was now calm, and I had a great iiniid to ven- 
tuiv out in m\ bout to tins wietk, not dtmhting but 
I iniglit find sunielhnig on iMiaid that iniglit be use- 
ful to me. But that did not altogcthci pi css me so 
much as the possibility that tlicic niiglit lie vet some 
living creature on Ixiaid, whose hie I might not only 
save, but might, by saving that life, (oiiifort my own 
to the last degi-ce. And tins thouglit clung so to 
my heart, th.at I could not be tjuiet night nor day, 
but I must venture out in mv boat on iMwid this 
wreck ; and cominittnig the rest to God s providence, 
I thought, the impression was so stioiig upon my 
mind that it could not Ik.* resisteii, that it must come 
from some invisible direction, and tlint I should be 
W'antnig to myself if I did not go 

Under the pow'ci of this impiession, I hastened 
back to my castle, prepared cvcrvtlniig foi my 
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for 
fi-esh water, a compass to steer bv, a Ixittle of riim

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


(for I had still a groat deal of that leR), a basket 
full of raisins. And thus, loading niyself with every- 
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the 
water out of licr, and got her afloat, loaded all iny 
cargo in her, and then went home again for more. 
My second cargo was a great Img full of rice, the 
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another 
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen 
of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, 
with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese , all which, 
with great labour and sweat, I bi ought to my boat. 
And praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; 
and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the shore, 
I came at last to the utmost point of the island on 
that side, viz., N E And now I was to launch out 
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to 
venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran 
constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, 
and which were very ternble to me, fmni the lemem- 
brance of the hazard I had been in before, and my 
heart began to fail me , for I foresaw -that if I was 
dnvcn into either of those currents, I should be 
earned a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my 
reach, or sight of the island again , and that then, 
as iny boat was but small, if any little gale of wind 
should rise, I should be inevitably lost 

These thoughts .so oppressed my mind, that I be- 
gan to give over niy eiiterpnse ; and having hauled 
my boat into a little CTcek on the shore, I stepped 
out, and .sate me down upon a little rising bit of 
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and 
desire, about my voyage ; when, as I was musing, 
I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the 
flood come on ; upon which iny going was for so 
many houi-s impracticable. Upon this, presently it 
occurred to me that I should go up to the highest 
piece of ground I could And and ob^rve, if I could,

AockI c'rtitie in, tliat I might judge whether, if I was 
driven one wav out, I might not exjieet to he driven 
another way home, with the hame rapidiiess of the 
currents. This thoiiglit was no soonei in my head 
hut I cast iiiy eie upon a little lull, which suffi- 
cicntli o\eiI(M)ked the sea Ixith ways, and fioni 
whence 1 liad a eleai new of the curients, or sets 
of the tide, and winch way I was to guide mi self m 
my return. Here I found, that as the cm lent of 
the ebh set out closi- hi the south point of the 
i.s]nnd, so the cui-i-ent of the fliaid set in close bv 
the shore of the iioith side , and that I liad nothing 
to do hut to kee{> to the noith of tlu‘ island in nil 
return, and I should do well I'liough 

Eiuoniaged with this ohser'.ition, 1 resolied the 
next moining to set out with the fiist of the tide, 
and leposing mvself for the night in the canoe, 
under the gieat watch-coat I inentioiied, I launched 
out. • I made fii'st a little out to sea, full noi th, till 
1 Ixigan to f<,'el tlie Ix-nefit of the eunent which set 
eastward, and which earned me at a great lato, 
and yet did not -so hiiiry me .is the southern .side 
current had done In-toie, mid so as to take from me 
all government of the boat , but having a strong 
steerage with mv piddle, I went at a great rate 
dire-etly for the wreck, and in less than two hours 
1 came up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at. The slop, which, 
by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in 
between two rocks. All the stein and ipiaiter of 
her was beaten to piei-es with the sea , and as her 
foreea.stle, which stuck in the iwks, had run on with 
gi-eat violence, her inainniast and foieiiiast weie 
brought by the hoaid, that is to sav, broken short 
off, hut her bowsprit was sound, and the head and 
bow' apfieaivd firm. When I came close to her a

(log appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, 
yelped and cried , and as soon as I called him, 
jumped into the sea to come to me, and 1 took him 
into the boat, but found him almost dead for hun- 
ger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and 
he eat it like a ravenous wolf that had lx!eu starving 
a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor 
creature some flesh water, with which, if I would 
have let him, he would have burst himself. 

After this I went on board , but the first sight I 
met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or 
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one 
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that 
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea 
brake so high, and so continually over her, that the 
men were not able to bear it, and were sti angled 
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much 
as if they had been under water. Besides the dog, 
there was nothing left in the ship that liiul life; nor 
any g(K)ds that I could see, but what weie spoiled 
by the water. Theic were some casks of lupioi, 
whether wine or biandy I knew not, which lay lower 
in the hold, and w'lnch, the water lieing ebbed out, 
I could see , but they were too big to meddle with. 
I saw several chests, which I believed lx;longcd to 
some of the .seamen ; and I got two of them into the 
Ixiat, without examining what was in them. 

Ilml the stem of the ship btien fixed, and the foie- 
part broken off, I am piersuaded I might have made 
a good voyage, for by what I found in these two 
chests, I had room to suppose tlie shiji had a great 
deal of wealth on boai d , and if I may guess by the 
course she steered, she must have been hound from 
the Buenos Ayies, oi the Rio de la I’lata, in the 
south part of America, beyond the Bia/ils, to the 
Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so peihaps to 
Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, 
[ 215 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


but of 110 use, at that time, to an \ body , and what 
became of the rest of her pi'ople, I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little task full of 
li(|Uor, of about twenty gallons, whiili I got into my 
boat w-ith ninth difficulty. Theic weie .scvcial mus- 
kets in a cabin, and a great jmwdci-hoin, with about 
four }>uui)ds of powder in it. As fin the muskets, I 
had no occasion for them, sti I left them, but took 
the powder-horn. I took a fiie-shovel and tongs, 
which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass 
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid- 
iron. And with this cargo, and the dog, I came 
away, the tide lieginniiig to make home again , and 
the same evening, about .in hour within night, I 
reached the hslaiid again, weaiy and fatigued to the 
last degree. 

I leposed that night in the boat , and in tlie 
morning I I’esolxed to haibour what I had gotten in 
iiiy new cave, not to caii\ it home to my aisHe. 
After refreshing myself, I got all my I'lirgo on shoic*, 
and lx*gan to examine the p.ii tii ulai-s I'lie <’ask of 
liquor I found to 1 k> a kind of nim, but not such as 
we had at the Brarils, and, in a wind, not at all 
good But when I came to open the chest-., 1 found 
several things of great use to me !• oi example, 1 

found 111 one a fine ca.se of bottles, of an extraoidi- 
nary kind, aiul filled with cxiribal wateis, fine, and 
very good; the Ixittlcs held about thiee pints each, 
and wciv tipped with sihei I found two pots of 
very good succadcs, or sweetmeats, so fastimed also 
on top, that the salt watei had not hurt them , and 
two more of the same, which the watei had spoiled. 
I found some veiy giuxl shuts, which were \eiv wel- 
come to me , and aliout a dozen and half of linen 
white handkeirhicfs and coluuied neekeloths. The 
former were also \eiy welcome, Ix'ing exceeding le- 
freshing to wipe m\ faix' ni a hot day Besides this, 
[216] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

when I came to the till in the chest, I found there 
three great bags of pieces of eight, which held out 
about eleven hundred pieces in all , and in one of 
them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, 
and some small bars or wedges of gold I suppose 
they might all weigh near a pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, 
but of little value , but by the circumstances, it must 
have belonged to the gunner’s mate , though there 
was no powder in it, but about two pounds of fine 
glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, 
for charging their fowling-picces on occasion. Upon 
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that w'as 
of any use to me , foi as to tlie money, I had no 
manner of occasion for it , ’t was to me as the dirt 
under my feet , and I would have given it all for 
three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, 
which were things I greatly wanted, but had not 
had on my feet now for many years. I had indeed 
gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took oft' of 
the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in 
the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the 
chests, which were very w elcome to me ; but they 
were not like <iur English shoes, either for ease or 
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. 
I found III this seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of 
eight in royals, but no gold I suppose this be- 
longed to a poorer man than the other, which 
seemed to belong to some officer 

Well, however, I lugg«l this money home to my 
cave, and laul it up, as I had done that before which 
I brought from our own ship, but it was great pity, as 
I said, that the other part of this ship had not come 
to my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded my 
canoe several times over with money, w Inch, if I had 
ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe 
enough till I might have come again and fetched it. 
[ 217 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Having now brought all in\ things on shore, and 
secured them, I «ent hack to my boat, and rowed 
or paddlecl her along the shore to hci old harbour, 
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to 
my old habitation, where I found eveiything safe 
and quiet. So I licgan to repose ni\self, live after 
inv old fa.shion, and take care of my family affairs , 
and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I 
was more Mgilant than I used to he, looked out 
oftoner, and did not go abroad so much , and if at 
any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always 
to the east part of the islanil, wheie I was pretty 
well satisried the savages ne\er came, and whcie 1 
could go without so many precautions, and such a 
loml of anils and animumtion as I always carried 
with me if I went the othci way. 

I lived in this condition neai two yearn more ; but 
my unlucky head, that was alwavs to let me know it 
was Ijorn to make iiiv body niiseiahle, was all this 
two years filled with piojccts and designs, how, if it 
were possible, I might get away from this island , 
for sonictiines I was foi making anothci voyage to 
the wreck, though my icosoii told me that thcie was 
iiotliing left thcie woitli the lia/aid of my voyage; 
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes" another , 
and I lielieve verily, if I had had the boat that I 
went from Sallee in, I .should have ventured to sea, 
hound anywhere, I knew not whither 

I have been, in all iny ciicuinstances, a memento 
to those who are touched with the general plague of 
mankind, whence, foi aught I know, oiie-hnlf of 
their miseries flow , I mean, that of not being satis- 
fieil with the station wherein God and Nature has 
placed them ; for not to look back upon my primi- 
tive condition, and the excellent advic-e of my father, 
the opposition to which wa.s, as 1 may call it, my 
or^naJ .tin, inv subsequent mistakes of the same

kind had been the means of my coming into this 
miserable condition ; for had that Providence, which 
so happily had seated me at the Brazils as a planter, 
blessed me with confined desires, and I could have 
been contented to have gone on gradually, I might 
have been, by this tune, I mean in the time of my 
being in this island, one of the most considerable 
planteis in the Brazils , nay, I am persuaded that by 
the improvements I had made in that little time I 
lived there, and the mciease I should probably have 
made if I had stayed, I might have been worth an 
hundred thousand inoidores And what business 
had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plan- 
tation, improving and incieasing, to turn supercargo 
to Guinea to fetch negroes, when pntienee and tune 
would have so increased our stock at home, that we 
could have bought them at oiii own door fiom those 
w hose business it was to fetch them , and though it 
had cost us something more, yet the iliftereiice of 
that price was by no means worth saving at so great 
a hazard. 

But as this is oidinainly the fate of young 
heads, .so leflection upon the folly of it is as ordi- 
iiaiilv the exereisc of more yeais, or of the dear- 
bought experience of time , and so it was with me 
now. And yet, so deep hail the mistake taken root 
in mv tempei, that I could not satisfy myself in my 
station, but was continually poring upon the means 
and possibility of my e.scape fiom this place. And 
that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader, 
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not 
be impropei to give .some account of my first con-

dition rostorcd to what it was Ix-fore. I had more 
wealtti, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all 
the richer ; for I liail no more use for it than the 
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniai-ds came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in 
March, the four and twentieth year of niy first set- 
ting foot in this island of solitariness I was lying 
in my bed, or hainni6ck, awake, M'ly well in hemth, 
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, 
no, nor any uneasiness of iiiiiid, more than ordinary, 
but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as 
to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise 
than as follows. 

It IS as impossible, as needless, to set down the in- 
numciable crowd of thoughts that whnled through 
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, 
in this night’s time. I lan o\er the whole history 
of my life in miniature, oi by abiidgment, as I may 
cull it, to my coming to this island, and also of the 
part of my life since I came to this island. In my 
lefleetioHs ujion the state of my case suite I came on 
shore on this island, I was comparing the happy 
posture of iny affairs in the first veais of my habi- 
tation here compared to tbc life of anxiet> , fear, and 
care which I had litcd e\ei sime I had seen the 
print of a foot m the sand; uoi that 1 did not believe 
the savages laul fie(|ueiited the island even all the 
while, and might have been several hundreds of them 
at times on shore there, but I had ncicr known it, 
and was incapable of any apprehensions about it. 
My siitisfaetioii was perfeit, though iiiy danger was 
the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my 
danger, as if I bad never really liecn exposed to it. 
This furnished my tlwHights with man\ very profit- 
able reflecfioiis, and particularly this one how in- 
finitely good that Providence is which has provided, 
in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds

to his sight and knowledge of things ; and though 
he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangera, 
the sight of which, if discovered to him, would dis- 
tract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene 
and calm, by having the events of things hid from 
his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which 
surround him. 

Aftei these thoughts had for some time entertained 
me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger 
I hod been in for so many years in this very island, 
and how I hod walked alxiut in the greatest secunty, 
and with all possible tranquillity, e\cn when perhaps 
nothing but a brow of a hill, a gieat tree, or the 
casual appioach of night had been betwi^cii me and 
the worst kind of destruction, \ i/ , that of falling 
into the hands of cannilials and savages, who would 
have seized on me with the same view as I did of a 
goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a 
dime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon 
01 a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I 
should say I was not sinceiely thankful to my great 
Preserver, to w'hosc singular protection I acknowl- 
edged, with great humility, that all these unknown 
deliverances were due, and without which I must 
inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for 
sometime taken up in considering the nature of these 
wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and how it 
came to pass in tlie vvoild that the wise Governor 
of all things should give up any of His creatures to 
such iiihiuiianitj , nay, to something so much below 
even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind. But 
os this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula- 
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the 
world these wretches lived in ? how fai’ on the coast 
was from whence they came ^ what they ventured over 
80 far from home for ? what kind of boats they had ? 

[221 ] 



ROBINSON' CRUSOE 

and why I rniglit not onler myself and my business 
so, that I might be as able to go ovei thither, as 
they were to <-ome to me. 

I nevei so much as tioubled irivself to consider what 
I should do with myself when I came thither, what 
would liecome of me, if I fell into the hands of the 
savages ; or how I should escape from tliem, if they 
attempted me ; no, nor so much as how it was possible 
for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted by 
some or other of them, without aiij possibility of 
delivering myself, and if I should not fall into then 
hands, what I should do for jirovision, oi whether I 
should bend my (ouise None of these thoughts, I 
sa^, so much ns came in my way ; but my mind was 
wholly lient upon the notion of ni\ passing ovei in 
my boat to the mainland. I looked back upon my 
present condition as the most miserable that could 
possibly be , that I was not able to thiow m\seif into 
anything, but death, that could be (ailed worse, 
that if I reached the shoie of the main, I might [ler- 
hans'incet with reliofi oi I might coast along, as I 
did OH the shore of Africa, till I came to some in- 
habited country, and wheie 1 might find some relief, 
and after all, perhaps I might fall in witli some 
Christian ship that might take me in ; and if the 
woisic came to the woi^t, I could hut die, which 
would put an end to all these miseries at once. Piav 
note, all this was the fruit of a disturlwl mind, an 
impatient teiiipei, made as it were despeiate by the 
long continuance of triy tioublesand the disappoint- 
ments I had met in t)ie wreck I had been on board 
of, and where I had lxa.'ii so iicai the obtaining what 
I so earnestly longed foi, iiz., somebody to speak 
to, and to learn some knowledge fniin (if the place 
where I was, and of the pi(ib.ible means of my de-

to Providence, and waiting the issue of the disposi- 
tions of Heaven, seemed to be suspiended , and I nad, 
as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to any- 
thing but to the pioject of a voyage to the main, 
which came upon me with such force, and such an 
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

Wiien this liad agitated my thoughts for two hours, 
oj more, with such iioleiM-e that it set mv very blood 
into a ferment, and m\ pulse beat as high as if 1 had 
been in a fever, meiely with the extraoiilmary fervour 
of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued 
and exhausted with the very thought of it, threw 
me into a sound sleep. (Jne w ould have thought I 
should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of any- 
thing relating to it , but I dieamed that as I was 
going out m the morning, as usual, from my castle, 
I saw' upon the slioie two canoes and eleven savages 
coming to land, and that they brought with them 
another savage, whom they were going to kill in 
order to eat linn , wlien, on a sudden, the savage 
that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran 
foi Ills life And I thought, in my sleep, that he 
came ninning into my little thick grove before my 
fortification to hide himself, and that I, seeing linn 
alone, and not pcrcciv ing that the other sought him 
that wav, showed myself to him, and smiling upon 
him, encouraged him, that he kneeled down to me, 
seeming to pray me to assist him , upon which I 
showed my ladder, made him go up, anil carried him 
into my c.ave, and he became iiiy servant ; and that 
as soon as I had gotten this man, I said to myself, 
“ Now I may certainly venture to the mainland ; for 
this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me 
what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and 
whither not to go for fear of being devoured , what 
places to venture into, and what to escape ” I waked 
with this thought, and was under such inexpressible

ROBINSON CRUSOK 

impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in 
my dream, that the disappointments which I felt 
upon coining to myself nmi finding it was no more 
than adi’eam wen; equally cxtriiv agant the other way, 
and thiew me into a \eiy great dejection of spirit. 

Upon this, however, I ni.adc tins coiiclusioii ; that 
iny only w-ay to go alxnit an attempt for an escape 
was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession ; 
and, if possible, it should be one of theii prisoners 
whom tnev hod condemned to lie eaten, and should 
bring thitlier to kill But these thoughts still were 
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible 
to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of 
them, and killing fheni all , and this was not only 
a very desperate attempt, and might nuscartv, but, 
on the other hand, I had greath sciiipled the law- 
fulness of it to me, and mv heait tiembled at the 
thoughts of slieddiiig so much blood, though it was 
for iiiy dcliveiance. I need not lepeat the argu- 
ments which occiiiicd to me against this, they being 
the same mentioned Ix'fore. But though I had 
other reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were 
enemies to my life, aiid would devour me if they 
cxiuld , that it was self-preHeivation, in tlie highest 
degiee, to dclnei myself from this death of a life, 
and was acting in my own defence as much as if 
they were actuallv assauirmg me, ami the like ; I ' 
.say, though these things aigucd foi it, vet the 
thoughts of shedding human blood for my tleliver- 
aiii’c were ver\ terrible to me, and such as I could 
by no means reconcile myself to a great while. 

However, at last, after inaiiv secret disputes with 
myself, and after great perplexities about it, for all 
the.se aiguiiieiits, one wav and another, struggled in 
my head a Jong time, the eager prevailing desire of 
deliverance at length ninsteml dl the rest, and I 
resolved, if possible, to get one of tho.se savages into

my hands, cost what it would. Mv next thing then 
was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was 
very difficult to resolve on. But as I could pitch 
upon no probable means for it, so I i-esolved to put 
myself upon the watch, to see them w'hen they came 
on shore, and lca\e the rest to the event, taking 
such measures as the opportunity should pi-esent, 
let' be what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my- 
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed 
so often, till I was heartily tired of it ; for it was 
above a year and half that I waited ; and for great 
part of that time went out to the west end, and to 
the south-west coiner of the island, almost e\ery 
day, to see for canoes, but none appeared. This 
was very discoui aging, and began to trouble me 
much ; though I cannot say that it did in this case, 
as it had dune sonic time before that, vi/., wear off 
the edge of my desire to the thing. But the longer 
it seemed to be delayed, the more eager 1 was for 
it. In a word, I was not at firat so careful to shun 
the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by 
them, as I was now' eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, 
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make 
them ciitiiely slaves to me, to do whatever I should 
direct them, and to prevent their being able at any 
time to do me any hurt It was a great while that 
I pleased myself with this affair , but nothing still 
presented. All my fancies and schemes came to 
nothing, for no savages came near me for a great 
while. 

About a year and half after I had entertained 
these notions, and by long musing had, as it were, 
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occa- 
sion to put them in execution, I was surprised, one 
morning early, with seeing nu less than five canoes

people who belonged to them all landed, and out of 
iny sight. The nuiiilier of them broke all my meas- 
ures; foi seeing M) iiianv, and knowing that they 
ubvays came foiii, oi six, or sometimes more« m a 
Ixial, I could not tell what to think of it, or how 
to take m_\ tiieasiires to attack twenty or thirty men 
single-handed . so I lay .still in my (‘astle, [xirplexed 
and discomforted. Iloweier, I put iinself into all 
the same pustuies foi an attack that I had formerly 
provided, and was pist ready foi lu-tion if anything 
nad presented. 1 las iiig waited a goinl while, listen- 
ing to hear if they made any noise, at length, being 
very impatieiit, I set my giiiis at the foot of my 
ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by 
my two .stages, as usual, staii<lmg so, however, that 
my head did not appear alxive the hill, .so that they 
could not iieieeive me by any means. Ileie I ob- 
served, bv the help of my jH'ispeetive glass, that they 
were no less than tliirtv in iiumbei, that they had a 
fire kindled, that they had liad meat iliessed. How 
they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was, 
but they vvei-e all daiiciiig, in I know not how maiiv 
barbarous gestuies and figures, then own way, round

While I was tluis IcKiking on them, I perceived by 
my {lerspective two iiii.scrnble wi-etthes dragged from 
the boats, where, if seems, they veie laid by, and 
were now bi ought out for the slaughter. I per- 
ceiveil one of them uiimediately fell, lieing knoeked 
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden swoi-d, for 
that was their w'ay, and two oi three others were at 
work immediately, cutting him open for their cook- 
ery, while the other victiin was left standing by him-

he started away from them, and ran with incredible 
sw'iftness along tlic sands directly towards me, I mean 
towauls that part of the coast where my habitation 
was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowl- 
edge) when I perceiv^ him to run my way, and 
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by 
the whole body , and now I expected that part of 
my dream was coming to pass, and that he would 
certainly take shelter in my giove , but I could not 
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest 
of it, viz., that the other savages would not pursue 
him thither, and find him there Iltiwever, I kept 
my station, and my spirits began to I’ecover when I 
found that tliere was not above three men that fol- 
lowed him , and still more was I encouraged when I 
found that he outstripped them exceedingly in run- 
ning, and gamed gixiund of them , so that if he (oiild 
but hold it tor half-an-hour, I saw easily he would 
fairly get away from them all

savage cscajiiiig came thither he made nothing of

very well foi him in the main.

fellow was that fled from them. It came now very 
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, 
that now was my time to get me a servant, and TCr- 
haps a companion or assistant, and that I was called 

f ilainly by Providence to save this jwior creature’s 
ife. I immediately run down the ladders with all 
possible expedition, fetches my two guns, for they 
were both out at the fiiot of the ladders, as I ob- 
served above, and gt'tting up again, with the same 
haste, to the top of the hill, I croWd toward the 
sea, and having a very short cut, and all down hill, 
clapped myself in the way between the pursuers 
and the nursue<l, hallooing aloud to him that fled, 
who, looking back, was at fii’st {x*rhaps as much 
frightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned with 
my hand to him to come back ; and, in the mean- 
time, I slowly advanced toward.s the two that fol- 
lowed. then rushing at once upon the foremost, I 
knocked him down with the stock of iny piece. I 
was loth to fire, because I would not have the rest 
hear, though, at that distance, it would not have 
been easily heard, and being out of sight of the 
smoke too, they would not have easily known what 
to make of it. Having kneaked this fellow down, 
the other who pui>ued w'lth him stopped, as if he 
had been frighted, and I advanced apace towards 
him; but as I came nearei, I perceived presently he 
had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at 
me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him firet, 
which I did, and killed him at the first shot. 

The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though 
he saw both his enemies fallen and Killecl, as he 
thought, yet was so frighted w ith the fire and noise 
of my piece, that he stocKl stock-still, and neither 
came forward or went backwaid, though he seemed 
rather inclined to flv still, than to come on. I 
hallooed again to him, and made signs to come for-

ward, which he easily understood, and came a little 
way, then stopped again, and then a little further, 
and stopped again ; and I could then perceive that 
he stooa trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, 
and had just lieen to lie killed, as his two enemies 
were, I beckoned him again to come to me, and 
gave him all the signs of encoiiragenient that I could 
think of, and he Ciune neaier and nearer, kneeling 
down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowl- 
edgment for iny saving his life. I smiled at him, 
and looked plcasantK, and bei-koned to him to come 
still nearer. At length he came close to me, and 
then he kneeled dow n again, kissed the ground, and 
laid his head ujioii the ground, and taking me by 
the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, 
was in token of swearing to be my slave for e\er I 
took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged 
him all I could But there was more w'ork to do 
yet, for I perceived the savage whom I kiicx’ked 
down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, 
and began to come to himself, so I pointed to him, 
and showing him the savage, that he was not dead, 
upon this he spoke some words to me . and though I 
could not undci stand them, yet I thought they were 
pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a 
maii'’s voice that I had heard, mv own excepted, for 
above twenty-five years But there was no time for 
such reflections now' The savage who was knocked 
down recovered himself so fai as to sit up upon the 
ground, and I peiveivcsl that my savage began to be 
afraid, but when I saw that, I presented my other 
piece at the man, as if I woiihl shoot him. Upon this 
my savage, for so I call him now, mode a motion 
to me to lend him iriv swoni, which hung naked in a 
belt by my side , so I did. He no sooner had it but 
he runs to his encm} , and, at one blow, cut ofl' his

have done it booiier or better, which I thought very 
strange for one who, 1 had i-eason to lx*lie\e, never 
saw n swoid in his life before, except their own 
wooden swords. However, it seems, as I learned 
afterwards, they make their wooden sw orils so sharp, 
so henvj, and tiie wood is so hard, that they will 
cut off heads c\cii with them, av, and aims, and that 
at one blow too When he had done this, he comes 
laughing to me in sign of triumph, and In ought me 
the Bwoid again, and with abundance of gestures, 
which I did not undei stand, laid it down, with the 
head of the savage that he had killed, just before 
me. 

But that which astonished him most, was to know 
how I had killed the other Indian so fai off, so 
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go 
to him , so I bade him go, as well ns I could 
When he came t(> him, he stood like one ama/ied, 
looking at him, turned him (list on one side, then on 
t’other, liMiked at the wound the bullet had miulc, 
which, it seems, was just in Ins breast, w licic it luul 
made a hole, and no great i)U!Uitit\ of blood had 
followed , but he had bled inwaidly, foi he was quite 
dead. He took up his bow' and arrows, and i-ame 
back , so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him 
to follow me, making signs to him that more might 
conic after them. 

Upon this he signwl to me that he should bury 
them w ith sand, that the> might not he seen by the 
rest if they followed , and so I made signs again to 
him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant lie 
had scraped a hole iii the saml w ith his hands big 
enough to bury the first in, and then diagged him 
into it, and covered him, and did so also by the 
other. I believe he hiul huiied them both in a 
quarter of an hour. Then enlling him awav, I car- 
ried him, not to inj castle, but quite away to my

cave, on the farther part of the island , so I did not 
let my dream come to pass in that part, \ iz., that 
he came into m\ grove for shelter. 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to 
eat, and a draught of water, which I found lie was 
indeed in great distix-ss for, by his running; and 
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go lie 
down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid 
a gicat parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, 
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the 
poor creature laid down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfc'ctly well 
made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, 
and well-shaped, and, as I leckoii, about twenty-six 
years of age. He had a very good (xiuntenance, not 
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some- 
thing very manly in his face , and yet he had all the 
sweetness and softness of an European in his counte- 
nance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was 
lung and black, not c'utled like wool ; his forehead 
very high and large ; and a great vivacity and spaik- 
ling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin 
was not (juite black, but very tawny ; and yet not of 
an ugly, jellow, nauseous tawmy, as the Brazilians 
and Virginians, and other natives of America are, 
but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had 
111 it something very agreeable, though not very easy 
to describe. His face was round and plump ; his 
nose small, not flat like the negroes ; a very good 
mouth, thin lip.s and his fine teeth well set, and 
white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about 
half-an-hour, he waked again, and comes out of the 
cave to me, for I had been milking my goats, which 
I had in the cnclosuix: just by. When he espied me, 
he came running to me, layjng himself down again 
upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an

ROBINSON CRITSOE 


humble, thankful di'iposition, making a many antic 
gestures to show it. At last he lavs his head flat 
upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my 
other foot upon hi>> head, as he had done before, and 
after this made all the signs to me of subjection, 
servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me 
know how he would serve me as long ns he li\ed. 
I understood him in many things, and let him know 
I was very well pleased with him. In a little tunc I 
began to s^M-ak to him, and teach him to sjieak to 
me; and, fiist, I made him know his name should 
be Friday, whidi was the day I saied bis life. I 
called him so for the memory oi the tunc I like- 
wise taught him to say master, and then let him 
know that was to be my name I likewise taught 
him to sav Ves and No, and to know the meaning 
of them I gaie him some milk in an earthen pot, 
and let him sec me drink it befoic him, and sop iii) 
bread in it, and I ga\e him a cake of bread to do 
the like, which he quickly complied with, and made 
signs that it was lery giKxl for him. 

I kept there with him all that night , but as soon 
as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes , 
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark 
naked. As we went by the place where he had 
buried the two men, he jxnnted exactly to the place, 
and showed me the marks that he had made to tiiul 
them again, making signs to me that we should dig 
them up again, and cat them. At this I appeared 
very angry, expresstsi iiiv abhorrence of it, made as 
if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned 
with my hand to him to come away , which he did 
immediately, with great submission ' I then led him 
up to the top of the hill, to sec if his enemies were 
gone ; and pulling out m> glass, I looked, and saw 
plainly the place whei c they liad lieen, but no ap-

pearance of them or of their canoes ; so that it was 
plain that they were gone, and had left their two 
comrades behind them, without any search after 
them. 

But I was not content with this discovery , but 
having now more courage, and conseijuently more 
curiosity, I takes my man Friday with me, giving 
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows 
at his back, which I found he could use \ery dex- 
terously, making him carry one gun for me, and I 
two for myself, and away we marched to the place 
where these creatures had lieen ; for I had a mind 
now to get some fuller intelligence of them. When 
I came to the place, my \ery blood ran chill in my 
veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror 
of the spectacle Indeed, it was a dreadful sight, 
at least it was so to me, though Friday made iiotli- 
ing of it. The place was covered with human bones, 
the ground dyed with their blood, great pieces of 
flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and 
scorched , and, in short, all the tokens of the trium- 
phant feast they had been making there, after a 
victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five 
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, 
and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and 
Friday, by his signs, mode me understand that they 
brought over four prisoners to feast upon ; that 
three of them weie eaten up, and that he, pointing 
to himself, was the fourth , that there had been a 
great battle between them and their next king, 
whose subjects it .seems he had been one of, and that 
they had taken a great number of prisoners , all 
which were carried to several places by those that 
had taken them in the fight, m order to feast upon 
them, as was done here by these wretches upon those 
they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls bones flesh, 
[ 2S3 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and whatever remained, and lav them together on a 
heap, and make a great fire upon it, and bum them 
alt to ashes. I found Friday had .still a hankeiing 
stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a canni- 
bal 111 his nature ; but I discovered so much abhor- 
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least 
apfieararice of it, that he durst not discover it . for I 
had, bv some me<ins, let him kiiou that I « ould kill 
him if he offered it. 

When we had done this we came back to our castle, 
and there I fell to work for iny man Fndai , and, first 
of all, I gave him a pair of linen diauers, «hich I had 
out of the poor gunner’s chest I mentioned, aiul whuh 
I found in the wreck , and which, with a little altera- 
tion, fitted him veiy well Then I made him a jei- 
kiri of goat’s-skin, as well as iny skill would allow, 
and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor , and I 
gave him a cap, w hich I had made of n hiire-skin, very 
convenient and fashionable enough , and thus he was 
clothed for the piesent tolerably well, and was mighty 
well plea,sed to see himself almost as well clothed as 
his master. It w true he went awkwurdU in the-se 
things at first, wearing the drawers was \er\ awk- 
ward to him, and the sleeves of the waisU'oat galled 
his shoulders, and the inside of his arms ; but a little 
easing them where he complained they hurt him, and 
using himself to them, at length he took to them 
very well. 

The next day after I came home to m\ hutch with 
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him. 
And that I might do well for him, and vet Ik* per- 
fectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the 
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the 
inside of the lost and in the outside of the fi]^t ; and 
as there was a door or entrance there into my cav e, 
I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it 
of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within 
[ 234 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the entrance ; and causing the door to open on the 
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my 
ladders too ; so that Fnday could no way come at 
me 111 the inside of iiiy innermost wall without niak- 
iiig so much noise in getting over, that it must needs 
waken me ; for my first wall had now a complete roof 
over it of long poles, coveiing all my tent, and lean- 
ing up to the side of the hill, uhich vias again laid 
cross with smaller sticks instead of laths, and then 
thatched over a great thickness witli the rice-straw, 
which was strong, like reeds ; and at the hole or place 
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had 
placed a kind of trap-door, ahich, if it had been 
attempted on the outside, would not have opened at 
all, but would have fallen down, and made a great 
noise , and as to weapons, I took them all into my 
side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution , for never 
man had a moie faithful, loving, sincere servant than 
I'rida> was to me, without passions, sulleniiess, or 
designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very 
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a 
father ; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his 
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso- 
ever. The iiiaiiy testimonies he gave me of this put 
it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed 
to use no pi-ecautions as to my safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and 
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God, 
in His providence, and in the government of the works 
of His hands, to take from so great a part of the 
world of His creatures the best uses to which their 
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, 
yet that He has bestowed upon them the same powei's, 
the same reason, the same affections, the same senti- 
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions 
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of grati-

tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all tlie capacities of doing 
good, and receiving good, that He has given to us ; 
and that when He pleases to offer to them occasions 
of exerting these, they are as ready, na\, more ready, 
to apply them to the right uses for which they were 
bestowed than we are. And tins made me very 
melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several 
occasions piasented, how mean a use we make of all 
these, even though we have these jioweis enlightened 
by the great lamp of instruttion, the Spirit of God, 
and by the knowledge of His VVoid added to our 
understanding ; and wh\ it has pleased God to hide 
the like saving knowledge fiom so many millions of 
souls, who, if I might pidge hy this pool savage, 
would make a much helter u«>e of it than we did 
I'rom hence, I sometimes was led too fai to invade 
the sovereignty of Providence, and as it were ariaign 
the justice of so aihitrarv a disposition of things, 
that should hide that light fi’om some, and leveal it

I shut it up, and checkwl inv thoughts with this coii- 
cluNion - first, that we did not know by what light 
and law these should be csnidcniiusl , but that as God 
was necessarily, and, by tljc nature of His being, in- 
finitely holy and just, v» it could not he but that if 
these creatures were all sentenced to absence fioni 
Himself, it was on flccoiint of sinning against that 
light, which, as the Scnptuie says, was a law to them- 
sdves, and by such rules a-- their consciences would 
acknowledge to be just, though tlio foundation was 
not discovered to us ; and, second, that sLill, as we aie

speak, and understand me when I spake. And he 
was the aptest scholar that ever was ; and particu- 
larly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so 
pleased when he could hut understand me, or make 
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me 
to talk to him. And now mv life l^gan to be so 
easy, that I began to say to myself, that could I but 
have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I 
was never to remove from the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my 
castle, I thought that, in ordei to bring Friday off 
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish 
of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste 
other flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning 
to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid 
out of my own flock, and bnng him home and dress 
it ; but as I was going, I saw a shc-goat lying down 
in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I 
catched hold of Friday. “Hold,” says I, “stand 
still,” and made signs to him not to stir Immetli- 
ately I presented my piece, shot and killed one of 
the kids The poor creature, who had, at a distance 
indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did 
not know, or could imagine, how it was done, was 
sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked 
so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down 
lie did not see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I 
had killed it, but ripjied up his waistcoat to feel 
if he was not wounded, and, as I found presently, 
thought I was resol veil to kill him , for he came and 
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said 
a great nianj things I did not understand; but I 
could easily see that the meaning was to pray me iioi 
to kill him 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would 
do him no barm , and taking him up by the hand, 
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which 1 had 
[237 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

killed, beckoiicfi to him to lun and fetch it, which 
he did ; and while he was wondennjj, and looking 
to see how the creature was killed, I loaded niy gun 
again ; and bv-and-by I saw a grcc-it fowl, like a 
hawk, sit upon a tioe, within shot, so, to let Friday 
understand a little what I would do. I called him to 
me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed 
a parrot, though I thought it had lieen a hawk ; I 
sav, |)ointing lo the parrot, and to inj gun, and to 
the ground under the jiarrot, to let him sec I would 
make it fall, I made him understand that I would 
shoot and kill that bird Accoidingly I filed, and 
bade him look, and inimediateh he saw tlie parrot 
fall. He stood like one fnghttsl again, notwith- 
standing all I had said to him , and I found he was 
the more aniai«(*d, bctaiise ho did not see me put 
anything into the gun, but Ihought that there must 
be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in 
that thing, able to kill man, tx*Mst, lin'd, or any- 
thing- near or far off. and the .istonishinent 'this 
created in him was such a.s could not wear off for a 
long time, and I believe, if I would have let him, 
he would have worshipiK-d me and m\ gun. As foi 
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it foi 
scveial days after, but would speak to it, and talk 
to it, as if it bad answeied Iniii, when he was b\ 
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was 
to desire it not to kill linn. 

Well, after his astonishment was n little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bud I 
h'ld shot, which he dul, hut stayed some time, for 
the parrot, not being quite dead, was fiiittcied a 
good way off from the place wheie slie fell. How- 
ever, he found her, took hci up, and hi ought her to 
me , and ns I ii.id perceiveil Ins ignorance about the 
gun before, I took this mlv.mtage to cliaige the gun 
again, and not let him sei* me do it, that I might

be ready for any other mark that might present. 
But nothing more oifcred at that time ; so I brought 
home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin 
off‘, and cut it out as well as I could , and having 
a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of 
the flesh, and made some very good bioth , and 
after I had begun to cat some, I gave some to my 
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very 
well , but that which was strangest to him, w'as to 
see me eat salt w ith it. lie made a sign to me that 
the salt was not good to eat, and putting a little 
into his ow’n mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and 
would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth 
with fresh water after it. On the other hand, I 
took some meat in my moutli without salt, and I 
pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, ns 
fast as he had done at the salt. But it would not 
do , he would never care for salt with his meat or in 
his broth , at least, not a great while, and then but 
a very little 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, 
I was resolved to feast him the next day with ixiast- 
ing a jiieee <if the kid. ITiis I ilid by hanging it 
bcfoie the fire in a string, as I had seen many people 
do in England, setting two jMiles up, one on each 
.side of the fire, and one cioss on the top, and tying 
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat tuin 
coiitiniially. This Eiiday ailimied veiy much. But 
when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many 
ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could 
not but undci'sbuid him, and at last he told me he 
would never eat man’s flesh any more, which I was 
very glad to hear. 

llie next day I set him to work to beating some 
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, 
as I observed before ; and he soon understood how 
to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen

what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make 
bttiad of ; for after that I let him see me make my 
bread, and bake it too , and in a little time Eiiday 
was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could 
do it myself. 

I began now to consider that, having two inouths 
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground 
for my harvest, and plant a laiger quantity of com 
than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece 
of land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
before, in which Friday not only worked very will- 
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully , and 
I told him what it was foi , that it was for corn to 
make more bread, because be was now with me, and 
that I might have enough for him and myself too 
He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me 
know that he thought I had much more labour upon 
me on his account, than I had for myself, and that 
he would work the harder foi me, if I would tell him 
what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led 
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and 
understand the names of almost everything I had 
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to .send 
him to, and talk a great deal to me , so that, in 
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue 
again, which, indeed, I l.ad very little occasion for 
before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the 
pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfac- 
tion in the fellow himself His simple, unfeigned 
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, 
and I began really to love the cieatuie; and, on his 
side, I bdieve he loved me more than it was possible 
for him ever to love any thing before. 

I had a mind once to trv if he had any hankering 
inclination to his own country again ; and having 
learned him English .so well that he could answer

get the better in fight , and so we began the follow- 
ing discourse - “You always fight the better,” said 
I. “How came you to be taken piisoner then,

Fridny. My nation lieat much for all that.

that time.

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all

for ; and, some time after, when I took the eoura^ 
to carrj him to that side, being the same I foimeny 
mentioned, he pi-esently knew tlie place, and told mo 
he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two 
women, and one child He could not tell twenty in 
English, but he numbered them by laying so many 
stones on a row, and {minting to me to tell them 
over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces 
what follows ; that after I had had this discourse 
with him, I asked him how fai it was fioin oiii island 
to the shoiv, and whether the canoes were not often 
lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes 
ever lost ; but that, after a little way out to the sea, 
there was a curient and a wind, always one way in 
the morning, the other in the afternoon 

'this I undei-stood to be no nioie than the sets of 
the tide, as going out or coming in , but I afterwards 
understood it was occasiont*d by the gieat di aught 
and retlux of the mighty iicei Oioonoko, ni the 
mouth or the gulf of which river, as I found aftei- 
waids, our island lav, and this land which I pei- 
ceived to the W and N\V. was the giv.it island

the countiy, the iiihabibuits, the sea, the coast, and 
what nation weie near. He told me all he knew, 
with the greatest openness iningiimble I asked him 
the names of the several luitions of liis sort of peo-

whence I easily umlei-stowl that these were the CW-

and pointed to my pfreat whiskers, which I mentioned 
before ; and that they had killed much mans, that 
was his worfl , bv all which I understood he meant 
the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been 
spread o%er the whole countries, and was remcmbeml 
by all the nations from fathci to .son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come 
from tins island and get among those white men. 
He told me, “ Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe.” I 
could not understand what he meant, or make him 
describe to me what he iiieant by two canoe; till at 
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it must 
be in a large gieat boat, as big as two canoes 

This part of Friday’s discourse began to relish with 
me very well , and from this tune I entertained some 
hopes that, one tunc or other, I might find an oppor- 
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that 
this poor savage might be a means to help me to 
do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been 
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and un- 
derstand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation 
of religious knowledge in his mind, particularly I 
asked him one tune. Who made him ^ The poor 
creature did not understand me at all, but thought 
I had asked who was his father. But I took it by 
another handle, and asked him who made the sea, 
the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods ^ 
He txild me it was one old Bcnaimickee, that lived 
beyond all. He could describe nothing of this great 
person, but that he was very old, much older, he said, 
than the sea or the land, thiyi the moon or the stars. 
I asked him then, if this old person had made all 
things, why did not all things worship him ^ He 
looked very grave, and with a perfect look of inno- 
cence said, “All things do say O to him I asked

anywhere:' Ho said, “Yes, they all went to Bena- 
muckee ” Then I asked him w hether these they eat 
up went thither too?' He said “Yes.” 

From these thiiiffs I began to instniet linn in the 
knowledge of the true God. I told him that the 
great Maker of all things li\ed up theie, pointing up 
towanls heaven ; that He governs the world bj the 
same power and pi ovidence by which He had made 
it, that He was omnipotent, could do ever} thing for 
U.S, give ever} thing to us, take eveivthing fioni us; 
and thus, by degrees, I opened his c}es He listened 
with great attention, and m'cived with jileasuie the 
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to ledeem us, and of 
the manner of making oiii pia}eis to God, and His 
being able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me 
one day that if our G<k 1 could hear u.s up be} ond the 
sun, He must needs lie a gieatei God than their 
Benainutkce, who lived but a little way off, and }ct 
could not heai till thev went up lo the gicat moun- 
tains where he dwelt to speak to him I asked him if 
he ever went thilhei to.s|K'ak to him ? He said. No ; 
the} never went that were young men , none went 
thither but the old men, whom he called then Oowo- 
kakee, that is, as I nnule him exjilain it to me, their 
religious, or clergy , and that they went to .say (J (so 
he called saying pray ei-s), and then came liack, and 
told them what Bcnamuckce said liv this I ob- 
.served that there is piiustciaft even amongst the mo.st 
blinded, ignorant pagans in the vvoild . and the jiolity 
of making a secret religion in ordei to preserve the 
veneiation of the people to the clergy is not only to be 
found in the Roman, but perhaps among all religions 
in the world, even among the most bnitish and bar- 
barous savages. ' 

I endeavoured to clear up this fmud to my man 
Friday, and told him that the pretence of their old

men going up to the niountiuns to sny O to their god 
Benanuickec was a cheat, and their bnnging word 
from thence what he said was iinicli more so, that if 
thev met with any answer, oi spoke with any one 
there, it must be with an evil spiiit ; and then I en- 
teivd into a long discourse with him about the devil, 
the original of him, his lebellion against Glod, his 
enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself 
up in the dark parts of the woild to lx; worshipjied 
instead of God, and as G<k 1, and the many stratagems 
he made use of to delude mankind to their luin , how 
he had a secret access to our passions and to our 
affections, to adapt his snai-cs so to our inclinations, 
as to cause us even to lx> oui own tempters, and to 
run upon our destruction by our own choice. 

I found it was not so easv to imprint right notions 
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being 
of a God Nature assisted all my arguments to evi- 
dence to him even tlie ni*cessity of a great First Cause 
and overruling, goverrinig Power, a secret directing 
Providence, and of the eijuity and justice of paying 
homage to Him that m<ulc ns, and the like But 
there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an 
evil spiiit , of his original, his being, Ins nature, and 
above all, of his inclination to do e\ il, and to draw 
us ill to do so too ; and the poor creature puzded me 
once in such a inaiiiiei by a (jiiestion meiely natural 
and innocent, that I .scarce knew what to say to him. 
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power 
of God, His oinnipoteiice. His dreadful aversion to 
sm. His being a consuming file to the workeis of 
iniquity; how, as He had made us all. He toiild 
destroy us and all the world in a moment , and he 
listens with great seriou-.iie-.s to me all the while 

After this I had been telling him how the devil 
was God’s enemy in the hearts of men, and used all 
his malice and skill to defeat the irood designs of

Rrovidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the 
world, nnd the like. “ Well,” says Friday, “ but you 
say God iv so strong, .so gi’eat , is He not much 
strong, much might as the devil ^ ” “ Yes, yes,” 

says I, “ Friday, God is stronger than the devil ; God 
IS above tlie devil, and therefore we pi ay to God to 
tread him down under our feet, and enable us to 
resist his temptations, and quench his fiery darts ” 
“But,”.sa\s he again, “if God much strong, much 
might as the devil, why God no kill the devil, so 
make him no more do wicked''” 

I was strangely sui prised at his cpiestion , and 
after all, though I was now an old inan, yet I was 
but a young doctor, mid ill ciioiigli qualified for a 
casuist, or a solver of difficulties , and at first I could 
not tell what to say , so I pretended not to hear him, 
and asked him what he said But he was too eani- 
cst for an answer to forget his question, .so that he 
repeated it in the vciy .same broken woids as above. 
By this time I had recovered in \ self a little, and I 
said, “God will at last jiiinish him severely , he is 
resell ed for the judgment, and is to lie cast into the 
bottomless pit, to dwell with eveilusting tire.” This 
did not satisfy Fiiday, but he leturns upon me, 
repeating ni> words, “ Reserve at last ' me no under- 
stand, but wh> not kill the devil now? not kill 
great ago?” “You mai as well ask me,” said I, 
“ why God does not kill vou and I, when we do 
wicked things here that offend Him; we are pre- 
served to lepent and lie panloiied.” He muse.s awliile 
at this. “ Well, well,” savs he, mightv affection- 
ately, “ that well , so you, I, dev il, all wicked, all 

S reserve, repent, Go<l (laidon all ” Here I was ran

testimony to me how the nieie notions of nature,

knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage

due to the supreme being of God, as the conscquenc'e 
of our nature, yet nothing but Divine revelation can 
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemp- 
tion purchased for us, of a Mediator of the new 
covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of 
God’s throne, I say, nothing but a revelation fiom 
heaven can form these in the soul, and that therefore 
the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I 
mean the Woid of God, and the Spiiit of God, 
promised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, 
are the absolutely necessary instructoi’s of the souls 
of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the 
means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discouree between 
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some 
sudden occasion of going out , then sending him foi 
something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God 
that He would enable me to instnict savingly this 
poor savage, assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of 
the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the 
knowledge of God in Chnst, reconciling him to Him- 
self, and would guide me to s|)eak so to him from 
the Woixl of God ns his con.scieiice might be con- 
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When 
he came again to me, I enteral into a long discourse 
with him upon the subject of the redemption of man 
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of 
the Gospel preached from heaven, viz., of repentance 
towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus 
I then explained to him as well as I coidd why 
oui blessed Redeemer took not on Him the natuie 
of angels, but the seed of Abraham , and how, tor 
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the 
redemption; that He came only to the lost sheep 
of the house of Israel, and the like.

in all the methods I took for this poor creature’s

poor savage. And I had more aftection in my in- 
quiry after things upon this occasion than ever I 
felt Iwfore , so that whcthei this pool wild wretch 
was tlie better for me or no, I had great reason to 
be thankful that ever he came to me. My giief set 
lighter upon me, my habitation grew c-oinfortable 
to me bey oiid mcasui’e ; and when I reflei ted, that 
in this solitary life which I had been confined to, 
I had not only been moved myself to look up to 
heaven, and to seek to the Hand that had hi ought 
me there, but was now to be made an instiument, 
under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I 
know, the soul of a pool savage, and bring him to 
the true know ledge of religion, and of the Chnstian 
doctrine, that he might know Chnst Jesus, to know 
whom IS life eternal ; — I say, when I reflected upon 
all these things, a seeiet jov run threugh every part 
of my soul, and I frei|ucntly rejoiced that ever I 
was brought to this phwe, which I had so often 
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that 
could possibly have befallen me 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remain-

ployed the hours between Fnday and I was such, as 
made the three yeare which we lived there togethei

and comforted, restored penitents. Wc had here the 
Word of God to read, <uid no farther off from His 
Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England. 

I always applied invself to reading the Scripture, 
to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of 
what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries 
and questions, made me, as I said before, a much 
better scholar in the Scnpture- knowledge than I 
should ever have lieen by my own private mere 
reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from ob- 
serving here also, from expeiience in this retired 
part of my life, viz , how infinite and inexpressible 
a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of 
the doctrine of salvation by Chiist Jesus, is so 

E lainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to 
e received and ^ndc^^t<MKi , that as the bate read- 
ing the Scripture made me capable of understanding 
enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the 
great work of sincere rcpeiitanc'c for my sins, and 
laying Ijold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to 
a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to 
all God’s commands, and this without any teacher 
or instructor (I mean human) , so the same plain 
instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening 
this savage creature, and bringing him to be such 
a Christian, as I have known few^ equal to him in 
ray life. 

As to all the disputes, wningliugs, stnfe, and con- 
tention which has hippened in the world about 
religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of 
Church goveimncnt, they were all perfectly useless 
to ns , as, for aught I can yet see, they have been to 
all the rest in the world. We had the sure guide 
to heaven, viz., the Word of God , and wc had, 
blessed be Gcxl, comfortable views of the Spirit of 
God teaching and instructing us by His Word, 
leading us into all truth, and making us both will-

ing and obedient to the instruction of His Word ; 
and I cannot see the least use that the greatest 
knowledge of the disputed points in religion, which 
have made such confusions in the w'oild, would have 
been to us if we could have obtained it. But I 
must go on w ith the historical part of things, and 
take every part in its order. 

Aflei Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could undei'stand almost all I 
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken 
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story, 
or at least so much of it as related to mv coming into 
the place, how I had lived theie, and how long. I 
let him into the mvstory,'for ‘ueh it was to him, of 
gunjiowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot , 
I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de- 
lighteil with, and I miwle him a belt, with a fiog 
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangi'iN 
in , and in the frog, instead at a hangts, I gave him 
a hatcliet, w hich was not only as good a weapon, 
in some cases, but much more useful upon other 
occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, and 

f iarticularly England, which I came fiom, how we 
ived, how we worshipped God, how we bcliaved to 
one another, and how we tnuled in ships to all parts 
of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck 
which I h.id been on lioanl of, and showed him, as 
near as I could, the plavv where she lay , but she was 
all beaten in pieces before, and gone. 

I showed him the rums of oui Iwat, which we lost 
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my 
whole strengtn then, but was now fallen almost all to 
pieces ITpon seeing this Imat, PViday stood masiiig 
a great while, and said nothing 1 asked him what 
it was he studied upon At last says he, “ Me see 
such boat like come to place at my nation.” 

[ 250 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I did not understand him a good while ; but at 
last, when I had examined further into it, I under- 
stood by him that a boat such as that had been, 
came on shore upon the country where he lived ; that 
is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of 
weather. I presently imagined that some European 
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and 
the boat might get loose and drive ashore , but was 
so dull, that I never once thought of men making 
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they 
might come ; so I only inquired after a description 
of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough , but 
bi ought me better to undeiNtand him when he added 
with some warmth, “ We save the white mans from 
drown.” Then I presently asked him if there was 
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat. 
“ Yes,” he said, “ the boat full of white mans.” I 
asked him how many. He told upon his fingers 
seventeen. I asked him then what beiiame of them 
He told me, “ They live, they dwell at my nation.” 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I pres- 
ently imagined that these might be the men liefong- 
ing to the ship that was cast away in sight of my 
island, as I now call it , and who, after the ship 
was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably 
last, had saved themselves in their boat, and were 
landed upon that wild shore among the savages. 

Upon this I inquired of him more critically what 
was become of them. He assured me they lived still 
there , that they had been there about four years , 
that the savages let them alone, and gave them 
victuals to live. I asked him how it came to pass 
they did not kill them, and eat them. He said, 
“ No, they make brother with them , ” that is, as I 
understood him, a truce , and then he added, “ They 
no eat mans but when make the war fight , ” that is

to say, thiiv ne\c*r cal any men but such as come to 
fight with them and are taken in battle 

It was after this some considerable time, that be- 
ing on the top of the hill, at the cast side of the 
island (from wnenee, as I have said, I had in a clear 
day discovered the main or c ontinent of Amenca), 
Friday, the weather being \eiy serene, looks very 
earnestly towards the mainland, and, in a kind of 
surprise, falls a-juniping and dancing, and calls out 
to me, for I was at some distance ftom him. I asked 
him what was the mattei ? “ O joy ' ” says he, “ O 

glad • there sec my country, there my nation ! ” 

I observed an extiaordinary sense of pleasure ap- 
peared in his face, and his c\cs sparkled, and his coun- 
tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a 
mind to be in his own country again , and this ob- 
servation of mine jiut a great many thoughts into 
me, which made me at fiist not so easy about my 
new. man Friday as I was before, and I made no 
doubt but that if l<'ndav could get back to his own 
nation again, he would not only forget all his reli- 
gion, but all his obligation to me ; and w ould be for- 
ward enough to give his countrymen an account of 
me, and c'oiiie back perhaps w'lth a hundred or two of 
them, and make a feast u|)ou me, at which he might 
be as merry as he used 'o Ik* with those of his ene- 
mies, when they weie taken in w’ar. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, 
for which I was veiy sorry afterwards. However, as 
my jealousy incre.ised, and held me some weeks, I 
was a little more ciicumspcxjt, and not so famihai 
and kind to him as befoie, in which I was certainly 
in the wrong too, the honest, grateful creature hav- 
ing no thought alKiiit it but what consisted wdth the 
best princijiles, both as a religious Christian and as 
a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full 
satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you m^ be sure 
I was every day pumping him, to see if he would 
discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected 
were in him , but I found eveiything he said was so 
honest and so innocent, that I coii Id h'nd nothing 
to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all mv 
uneasiness, he made me at last entiiely his oun 
again, nor did he in the least perceive that I was 
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of 
deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather 
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con- 
tinent, I called to him, and said, “ Friday, do not 
you wish yourself in your own country, youi own 
nation*’” “Yes," he said, “I be much O glad to 
be at my own nation." “What uould you do 
there ''"said I. “Would you turn wild again, eat 
men’s fle.sh a^in, and be a savage as you were be- 
fore S’ " lie looked full of concern, and shaking his 
head said, “ No, no, Fiidav tell them to live good , 
tell them to pray God ; tell them to cat corn-bread, 
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again.’" •• Why then," 
said I to him, “they will kill you.” He looked giave 
at that, and then said, “ No, they no kill me, they 
willing love learn." lie meant by this they would 
be willing to Icani He added, they Icained much 
of the liearded mans that come in the boat Then I 
asked him if he would go bai-k to them He smiled 
at that, and told me he could not swim so far I 
told him I would make a lanoc fur him. He told 
me he would go, if I would go with him. “ I go ' " 
says I, “whv, they will eat me if I come there" 
“No, no," says he, “me make they no eat you , me 
make they much love you." He meant, He would 
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved 
his life, and so he would make them love me Then 
he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were

to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he exiled 
them, who came on shore there in disfress. 

From tliis time I confess I hafl a mind to venture 
over, and see if I could possibly join with these 
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards 
or Portuguese , not doubting but, if I could, we 
might find some method to escape from thence, Ixiing 
upon the continent, and a good company together, 
better than I could from an island forty niil&s off‘ the 
shore, and alone, ivithout help So, after some days, 
I took Friday to work again, by way of discourse, 
and told him I would give him a boat to go back to 
his own nation , and accordingly I carried him to my 
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and 
having cleaied it of water, for I always kept it sunk 
in the water, I brought it out, showed it him, and we 
both went into it 

I found ho was a most dexterous fellow at manag- 
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast 
again as I could So when he was in I said to him, 
“Well now, Fiidav, shall we go to yoin nation i*’' 
He looked veiy dull at my saying so, which, it seems, 
was because he thought the boat too small to go so 
far. I told him then I had a bigger , so the next 
day I went to the place where the fii-st Iwat lay which 
I had mode, but which I could not get into watei. 
He said that was big enough , but then, as I had 
taken no care of it, and it had lam two or three and 
twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, 
that it was in a manner I'otten Fi iday told me such 
a boat w'ould do icry well, and w'ould carry “ much 
enough victual, drink, bieatl,” that was his way of 
talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon 
my aesign of going over with him to the continent, 
that I told him w'e would go and make one as big as 
that, and he should go home in it. He answered not

one word, but looked vcrj grave and sad. I asked 
him what was the matter with him ? He askeil me 
again thus, “ Why you angi-y mad with Friday ? what 
me done?” I asked him what he meant I told him 
I was not angi-y with him at all “No angry’ no 
angry'” says he, lepeatiiig the woitls sevcml times. 
“Why send Friday home away to my nation.?” 
“ Why,” says I, “ Friday, did you not say you wished 
you were there ? ” “ Yes yes,” say s he, “ wish lie both 

there, no wish Friday there, no master there ” In a 
word, he would not think of going there without me. 
“I go there, Fnday ' ” says I, “what shall I do 
there ? ” He turned veiy i|Uick upon me at this . 
“ You do great deal much gootl,” says he , “ you teach 
wild mans to be good, soljei, tame mans, you tell 
them know God, pray GckI, and live new life.” 
“Alas' Friday,” says I, “thou know&st not what 
thou .sayest. I am but an igiioiant man myself.” 
“Yes, yes,” says he, “you teachee me good, yon teaehee 
them good.” * “No, no, Friday,” says I, “you shall 

S o without me; leave me here to live by myself, as I 
id before ” He looked confused again at that wonl, 
and running to one of the hatchets which he used to 
wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and gives it me. 
“ What must I do with this ? ” says I to him. “ You 
take kill Fmlay,” says be. “ What must I kill y on 
for ? ” said I again. He returns very quick, “ What 
you send Friday away for ? Take kill Fnday, no 
send Friday away ” 'ITiis he spoke so earnestly, 
that I saw tears stand in his eyes In a word, 1 so 
plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me, 
and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, 
and often after, that I would never send him away 
from me if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a 
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part 
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his 
[ 265 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

desire to go to liis own country was laid in his ardent 
affection to the people, and his hopes of iiiy doing 
them good ; a thing which, us I had no notion of 
myself, so I had not the least thought or intention 
or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a 
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as 
above, founded on the supposition gathered from the 
discourse, \i/, that there were seventeen bearded 
men there , and, theieforc, without any more delay 
I went to work ivith Friday to find out a great tree 
proper to fell, and make a large j>eringiiii, or canoe, 
to undertake the voyage. ITicie weie trees enough 
in the island to have built a little Hcet, not of pen- 
ag)MS and canoes, but even of good laige vessels. 
But the main thing I looked at was, to ^t one so 
near the water that we might launch it when it was 
made, to avoid the mistake I committed at fii'st. 

At last Friday pitchwl upon a tree, for I found he 
knew, much Ixitter than I what kind of w-oixl was 
fittest for it , nor can I tell, to this day , what wood 
to call the tiee we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree we call fustic, or lietween that and the 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour 
and smell. Fridav was for burning the hollow oi 
cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I 
showed hull how rather lO cut it out with tools, 
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did 
very handily , and in alxmt a month’s haid labour 
we finished it, and made it veiy handsome, especially 
when, with oui axes, which I showed him how to 
handle, we cut and hewed tlie outside into the true 
shape of a boat Aftei this, however, it cost us near 
a fortnight’s time to get hei along, as it were inch 
by inch, upon great rollers into the watei , but when 
she was in, she would have carried twenty men with 
great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was 

[ 256 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and 
how bwift my man Friday would manage hei, tiiiii 
her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he 
would, and if wc might venture over in her. “ ^ es,” 
he .said, “ he venture over in her very well, though 
great blow wind.” However, I had a farther dasigii 
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a 
ma.st and sail, and to (it her with an anchoi and 
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get , 
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which 
I found near the place, and which there was great 
plenty of in the island , and I .set Friday to work to 
cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape 
and Older it. But as to the sail, that was my par- 
ticular cai e. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces 
of old sails enough , hut as I had had them now 
twentj-six years by mo, and had not lieen veiy caie- 
ful to preserve them, not imagining that I .should 
ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt 
but they were all lotten, and, indeed, most of them 
were so. However, I found two pieces which ap- 
peared pretty good, and with these I went to work, 
and with a great deal of (Mtins, and awkwaid tedious 
stitching (you may be sure) for want of needles, I, at 
length, made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what 
we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go 
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at 
the top, such as usually our shijis’ longboats sail 
with, and such as I best knew how to manage , be- 
cause it was such a one as I had to the boat in which 
I made my escape fioin Barbary, as related in the 
first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, 
viz., rigging and fitting rny riuost and sails , foi I 
finisheil them very complete, making a small stay, 
and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist, if we should 
turn to windward ; and, which was more than all, I

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


fixed a rudder to the stem of her to steer with ; and 
though I was but a bungling shipwnght, yet as I 
knew the usefulness, and even nec'ess.ity, of such a 
thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it, 
that at last I brought it to pass , though, consider- 
ing the many dull contrivances I had for it that 
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour £is 
making the boat. 

Alter all this was done too, I had iny man Friday 
to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of 
my boat , for though he knew very well how to pad- 
dle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail 
and a rudder . and was the most amazed when he 
saw me work the boat to and again m the sea by the 
rudder, and how the sail jibbed, and filled this way, 
or that way, as the course we sailed changed , I say, 
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and 
amazed. Howes cr, with a little use I made all these 
things familiar to bun, and he became an expert 
sailor, except that as to the compass I could make 
him -understand \cr\ little of that. On the other 
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and 
seldom or never an> fogs in those parts, thoie was 
the Ic.ss occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were 
alwajs to be seen by night, and the shore by day, 
except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody caieil 
to stir abroad, either by land or sea 

I was now entered on the .se\cn and twentieth 
year of my captivity in this place, though the three 
last years that I had this creature with me ought 
rather to lie left out of the account, my habitation 
lieing quite of another kind than in all the re.st of 
the time. I kept the annnersary of rny landing 
here with the same thankfulness to (irod for His 
mercies as at first , and if I iiad such cause of ac- 
knowledgment at fiist, I had much more so now, 
having such additional testimonies of the care of 
[ 258 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Providence over me, and the great hopes I hatl of 
being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had 
an invincible impression u{M)n my thoughts that my 
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be 
another year in this place However, I went on 
with my husbandly, digging, planting, fencing, as 
usual. I gatbeiecf and cured my grapes, and did 
every necessary thing as before 

The rainy season wa.s, in the meantime, upon me, 
when I kept more within doors than at other times ; 
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we 
could, bnnging her up into the creek, where, as I said 
in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship , 
and hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark, 
I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big 
enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her 
watei enough to float in ; and then, when the tide 
was out, we made a strong dam ai ross the end of it, 
to, keep the water out , and so she lay dry, as to the 
tide, from the sea , and to keep the rain off, we laid 
a great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was 
as well thatched as a house , and thus we waited for 
the month of November and December, in which I 
designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season liegan to come in, as the 
thought of my design returned with the fair weather, 
I was preparing daily for the voyage , and the first 
thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
visions, being the stores for our voyage ; and in- 
tended, in a week or a fortnight’s time, to open the 
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one 
morning upon something of this kind, when I called 
to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore and see if he 
could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we 
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs 
as well as the flesh Friday had not been long gone 
when he came running back, and flew over my outer

wall, or fetK*e, like one that felt not the ground, or 
the steps he set his feet on , and before I had time 
to speaK to him, he eries out to me, “ O master • 

0 master ' O sorrow ! O had ! ” “ What ’s the 
matter, Friday ^ ” says I. " O yonder, there,” says 
he, “ one, two, three eanoe ' one, two, three ! ” By 
his way of speaking, I eonehided tliere were six , but, 
on inquiry, I found it was but three. “Well, Fn- 
day,” says I, “do not be fiighti'd.” So I hofirtened 
him up as well as I could. However, I saw the |K)or 
fellow was most terribly scai'cd , for nothing ran in 
his head hut that they wcie come to look for him, 
and would <-iit him in pieces, and eat him , and 
the poor fellow ti'vmbled so, that I scarce knew what 
to do with him. I coinfortctl him as well os I could, 
and told him I was in as much dangei as he, and 
that they would eat me as well as him. “But,” 
say.s J, “IVKlai, we must i-esolve to fight them. 
Can you fight,' Friday <* ” “ Me shoot,” says he ; 
“ but there come main gixiat number ” “ No mat- 
ter for that,” said 1 again , “ our guns w ill fright 
them that we do not kill ” So I asked him whcthei, 
if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, 
and .stand by me, and do just as I bid him He 
said, “ Me (he when you Ir 1 die, master ” So I went 
and fetched a good dram of rum. and g.ave him ; for 

1 had been .so g(Kxl a husband of my rum, that I had a 
great deal left When he had drank it, I made him 
take the two fowling-pieces, which we alwavs carried, 
and load tliem with large swan-shot, as big as small 
pi.stol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loadtsl 
them with two slugs and five small bullets each , 
and my two pistols I loaded witli a brace of bullets 
each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by 
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus pioparcd myself, I took my 
perspective glass, and went up to tlie side of the hill 
[ 260 ] 



HOBINSOxV CRUSOE 


to see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by 
my glass, that there were one and twenty savages, 
three prisoners, and thiee canoes, and that their 
whole business seemed to be the tnumphant banquet 
upon these three human botlies , a barbarous feast 
indeed, but nothing inoie than, as I had observed, 
was usual with them. 

I observed also that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Fnday made his escape, but 
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and 
where a thicK wood came close almost down to the 
sea. This, w'ith the abhonenee of the inhuman 
errand these wivtches came about, filled me with 
such nidignution, that I came down again to Fnda>, 
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, 
and kill them all, and asked him if he would stand 
by me lie was now gotten over his fright, and his 
spirits being a little laised witb the dram I had given 
him, he was \ei\ ebeeiful, and told me, as before, he 
would die when I bid die 

In this fit of fur>, I took fiist and divided the arms 
whicii I had charged, as liefon-, Ix-tvveen us. I gave 
I'Vid.iv one }»istoI to stiek m his girdle, and three 
guns upon his shoulder . and I took one pistol, and 
the other till ec> nnself, and in this posture vve inarched 
out. I took a small liottle of rum in niv pocket, and 
gave Friday a laige bag with more powder and 
bullet , and as to oixlers, I ehargeil him to kc“ep close 
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything, 
till I bid him, and m the meantime not to speak a 
word. In this posture I fetched a compass to niv 
right hand of near a mile, ns well to get oxer the 
creek as to get into the woikI, so that I might come 
within shot of them before' I sliould be disiovered, 
which I had seen, by my glass, it was easy In do. 

While I was inuking this iii.iich. my former 
thoughts returning, I bc^an to abate my resolution. 

[ 261 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their 
number ; for a* they were naked, unarmed wretches, 
’tis certain I was superior to them , nay, though I 
had been alone. But it oceun-ed to my tlioughts 
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I 
wa.s in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack 
people who had neither done or intended me any 
wrong ; who, as to me, were innocent, and whose 
barbarous customs were their own disaster , being in 
tliein a token indeed of God’s having left them, with 
the other nations of that pait of the world, to such 
stupidity, and to such inhuman courses , but did not 
call me to take upon me to be a judge of their 
actions, much less an executionei of His justice , 
that whenever He thought fit. He would take the 
cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance, 
punish them, as a people, for national crimes , but 
that, in the meantime, it was none of my business , 
that, it was true, Fiiday might justify it, because he 
was a declared enemy, and in a state of wai with 
those vety particular people, and it was lawful for 
him to attack them , out I could not say the same 
with respect to me. These things were so warmly 
pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, 
that I resolved I would only go and place myself 
near them, that I might obseive their baibaious 
feast, and that I would act then as God should 
direct ; but that, unless something offered that w'as 
more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not 
meddle with them 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and 
with all possible wariness and silence, Fn'day follow- 
ing clo.se at my heels, I marched till I came to the 
skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to 
them ; only that one cwner of the wood lay between 
me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and 
showing him a great tree, which was just at tlic 
[ 262 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they 
were doing. He did so, and came immediately back 
to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed 
there ; that they were all about their fire, eating the 
flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay 
bound upon the saiui, a little from them, which, he 
said, they would kill next ; and, which fired all the 
very soul within me, he told me it was not one of 
their nation, but one of the bearded men, whom he 
had told me of, that came to their country in the 
boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming 
the white, bearded man ; and going to the tree, I saw 
plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the 
beach of the se.i, with his hands and his feet tied 
with flags, or things like rushes, and that he was an 
European, and had clothes on. 

Theiv was another tree, and a little thicket beyond 
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place 
where I was, which, b\ going a little way about, I 
saw I might come at undiscovereil, and that then I 
should be within Imlf shot of them; sol withheld 
my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the 
highest degree , and going back about twenty paces, 
I got behind some bushes, which held all the wav till 
I came to the other tree ; and then I came to a little 
rising ground, w hich gave me a full view of them, at 
the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of 
the dmidful wretches sat upon the ground, all close 
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to 
butcher the poor Chnstian, and bring him, perhaps 
limb by limb, to their fire ; and they were stormed 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to 
Friday . “ Now, Friday,” said I, “ do as I bid thee.” 
Friday said he would. “ Then, Friday,” says I, “ do 
exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing.” So I set 
[ 868 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon 
the ground, and Friday did the like his ; and w'lth 
the other musket I took iny aim at the savages, 
bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he was 
ready, he said, “Yes” “Then fire at them,” said 
I ; and the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that 
on the side that he .shot he killed tw o of tliem, and 
wounded three more , and on my side 1 killed one, 
and wounded two. I’hey Vere, } ou may be sure, in 
a dreadful constei nation , and all of them who were 
not hurt jumped u}) upon their feet, but did not im- 
mediately know which way to run, or which way to 
look, foi they knew nof frem whence their de.struc- 
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, 
that, as I had bid him, he might obser\e what I 
did, so as stKiii as the fii-st shot was made 1 thiew 
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piccc, and 
Friday duf the like. lie sees me cotk and present, 
he did the same again “Are you le.idy, Fiiday 
said I. “ Yes,” savs he. “Let fly, then,” says I, “in 
the name of God'” and with that I filed again 
among the amazed wretches, and ,so did I'Viday , 
and as our pieces were now loaded with what I 
called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found 
only two drop, but so many were wounded, that they 
ran about yelling and .seicaniiiig like mad cieatures, 
all bloody, and miserably wounded most of them, 
whereof three more fell quickly after, though not 
quite dead 

“ Now, Fndav,” says I, lay ing dow n the discharged 

t iicces, and taking up the musket which was yet 
oaded, “follow me,” says I, which he did with a 
great deal of courage , upon which I rushed out of 
the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at 
my foot. As soon as I jjerceived they saw me, I 
shouted as loud os I could, and bade Friday do so 
[ 264 -] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


too ; and running as fast as I could, which, by the 
way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I 
was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who 
was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, lie- 
tween the place where they sat and the sea. The 
two butchers, who were just going to woik with him, 
had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled 
in a terrible flight to the seaside, and had jumped 
into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the 
same way. I turned to Friday, and bid him step 
forwards and fire at them. He understood me im- 
mediately, and running about forty yards, to be near 
them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed 
them all, for I saw them all full of a heap into the 
boat ; though I saw two of them up again quickly. 
However, he killed two of them, and wounded the 
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the lioat 
as if he had been dead. 

While m\ man Friday fired at them, I pulled out 
niv knife and cut the flags that Ixiund the poor vic- 
tim ; and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, 
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he 
was. He aiisweied iii Ijatiii, (’hristianus ; but was 
so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand or 
speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave 
it him, making signs that he should drink, which he 
did , and I gave him a piec-e of bread, which he eat. 
Then I asked him what countryman he was ; and he 
said, Espagniole , and being a little recovered, let 
me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, 
how much he was in niy debt for his deliverance. 
“ Soigmor,” said I, with as much Spanish as I could 
make up, “ we will talk afterwaids, but we must fight 
now If 1 ou have any strength left, take this pistol 
and sword, and lay about you.” He took them very 
tliankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his 
hands but, as if they had put new vigour into him, 
[265 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


he flew upon his murderers like a fur\, and had cut 
two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth 
is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor 
creatures were so much mghted with the noise of 
our pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement 
and fear, and had no more power to attempt their 
own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot : 
and that waii the case of those five that Friday shot 
at in the boat , for as three of them fell with the 


hurt they received, so the other two fell with the 
fright. 

I kept rny piece in iny hand still without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I 
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword. So I 
called to Friday, and liade linn nin up to the tiee 
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there that had been discharged, w'hich he did 
with great swiftness , and then giving him my 
musket, I sat down myself to load all the icst again, 
and bade them come to me when they w'anted. 
While I was loading these pieces, there hapiiened a 
fierce engagement between the Spaiiiaid ana one of 
the savages, who made at him with one of their 


great wooden swords, the same wea|)oii that was to 
nave killed him before if I had not pi evented it 
The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave os 
could be imagined, though weak, had fought this 
Indian a good while, and had cut him two great 
wounds on his head ; but the .savage being a .stout, 
lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him 
down, being faint, and was wiinging my sword out 
of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, 
wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his 

f irdle, shot the savage thnmgh the body, and killed 
im upon the spot, before I, who was running to 
help him, could come near him 

Friday being now left to his lilierty, pursued the

flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his 
hatchet; and with that he despatched those three 
who, as I said before, were wounded at iirst, and 
fallen, and all the inist he could come up with ; and 
the Spaniard coining to me for a gun, I gave him 
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the sava^s, and wounded them both ; but 
as he was not able to run, they both got from him 
into the wood, where Friday pumued them, and killed 
one of them , but the other was too nimble for him, 
and though he was wounded, yet had plunged him- 
self into the sea, and swam with all his might off 
to those two who were left in the canoe; which 
three in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know 
not whether he died or no, were all that escaped oui 
hands of one and twenty. The account of the rest 
is as follow’s . — 

3 killed at our first shot from the tree 

2 killed nt the next shot 

2 killed by Friday in the lioat 

2 killed by ditto, of those at first wounded. 

1 killed by ditto m the wood 

3 killed by the Spaniard. 

4 killed, being found ilropped here and there of 

their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase 
of them 

4 escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if 
not dead. 

iil m all 

'Fhose that were in the canoe worked hard to get 
out of gun-.shot, and though Friday made two or 
three siiots at them, I did not find that he hit any 
of them. Friday would fain have had me take one 
of their canoes, and pursued them ; and, indeed, 1 
was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying

the news home to their people they should come 
back perhaps with two or three hundred of their 
canoes, and devour us by mere multitude. So I 
consented to pursue them by sea, and riinniiif^ to 
one of their canoes I jumped in, and liade Friday 
follow 1110. But when I was in the canoe, I was 
surprised to find another poor creature lie there 
alive, hound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for 
the .slaughter, and almost dead with fcai‘, not know- 
ing what the matter was , for he had not been able 
to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so 
hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, 
that he had really but little life in him. 

I immediately <‘ut the twisted flags or rushes, 
which they had bound him with, and would have 
helped him up, but he c-ould not stand or speak, 
but groaned mo.st piteously, believing, it seems, still 
that he was only unbound in oidei to lie killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance : and jmlling out 
iny bottle, made linn give the poor wretch a dram , 
which, with the news of his being delivered, levived 
him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Fiiday 
came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it 
would have mov'ed any one to teans to have seen 
how Friday kissed him, eiiibniced him, hugged him, 
cried, laughiil, hallooed, jumped about, danced, 
sung ; then cried again, wrung his hands, heat his 
own face and head, and then sung ami jumped about 
again, like a distracted creature It was a good 
while before I could make him speak to me, oi tell 
me what wa.s the matter; but when he came a little 
to himself, he told me that it was his father 

It is not easy for me to cxjiress how it moved me 
to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked 
in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and of 
his being delivered from death, nor, indec>d, can I 
[fJ 68 ] 



KOBINSON CRUSOE 


describe half the extravagancies of his affection after 
this ; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, 
a great many times. When he went in to him, he 
would sit down by him, open his bi^east, and hold 
his father's head close to his bo.som, half-an-hour 
together, to nourish it ; then he took his arms and 
ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the bind- 
ing, and chafed and rubbed tlicin with his hands ; 
and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some 
rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did 
them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the 
canoe with the other savages, who were now gotten 
almost out of sight ; and it was happ\ for us that we 
did not, for it blew so hard within two houis after, 
and before they cinild be gotten a quarter of their 
wav, and continued blowing so hard all night, and 
that from the north-west, which wa.s f^ainst them, 
that I could notsupposetheir boat could live, or that 
they ever leached to their own coa.st. 

But to return to Friday. He was so busy about 
his fathei, that I could not find in my heart to take 
him off for some time ; but after I thought he could 
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came 
lumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 
extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his 
father any bread He shook his head, and .said, 
“ None ; ugly dog cat all up self.” So I gave him 
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I earned on 
pm pose. I also gave him a dram for himself, hut 
he would not taste it, but earned it to his fathei. 
I had 111 my pocket also two or three bunches of my 
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his 
father. He Inul no sooner given his father these 
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run 
away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a 
rate ; foi he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that 
[ 269 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

ever I saw I say, he run at such a rate, that he 
was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and 
though I called, and hallooed too, after him, it 
was all one, away he went ; and in a quarter of an 
hour I saw linn come back again, though not so 
fast as he went ; and as he came nearer 1 found his 
pace was slacker, because he had something in his 
hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had liccn 
quite home for an earthen jng, or pot, to bring his 
father some fresh water, and that he had got two 
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave 
me, but the water he earned to his father. How- 
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of 
it. This water revived his father more than all the 
rum or spirits I had given him, for he was just faint- 
ing with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called to him to 
know if theie was any watei left He said, “ Yes 
and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who 
was in as niiieli want of it as his father ; and I sent 
one of the cakes, that Fnday brought, to the Span- 
iard too, who was indeed very weak, and was repos- 
ing himself upon a giecn place under the shade of a 
tree ; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very 
much swelled with the nide bandage he had been 
tied with. When I saw that upon Fndav's coming 
to him with the water he sat up and drank, and 
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, 
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in 
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thank- 
fulness that could appear in any countenance ; but 
was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted 
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up 
upon his fc*et. He tried to do it two oi three times, 
but was leally not able, his ankles were so swelled 
and so painful to him , so I bade him sit still, and 
[ 870 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with 
rum, as he had done his father's 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, ever) 
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was 
here, turned his head about to see if his father was 
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting , 
and at last he found he was not to lie seen ; at w hieh 
he started up, and without speaking a woid, ffew 
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce 
perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went. 
But when he came, he only found he had laid him- 
self down to ease his limbs ; so Friday came back to 
me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to 
let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him 
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our 
dwelling, where I would take care of him. But 
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard 
quite up upon his b^-k, and carried him away to 
the boat, and set him down softly upon the side or 
gunnel of tlie canoe, with his feet in the inside of it, 
and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to 
his father , and presently stepping out again, launched 
the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than 
I could walk, though the wind blew' pretty hard too 
So he brought them both safe into our creek, and 
leaving them in the boat, nins away to fetch the 
other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and 
asked him whither he went He told me, “Go 
fetch moie boat.” So away he went like the wind, 
for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and he 
had the other canoe in the crcek almost a.s soon as 
I got to it by land , so he wafted me over, and then 
went to help our new guests out of the boat, which 
he did , but they were neither of them able to walk, 
so that poor Fnday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this I went to work in my thought, 
and calling to Fi iday to bid them sit down on the

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of 
hand-bairow to lay them on, and Fnday and I 
carried them up both together upon it between us. 
But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or 
fortification, we were at a worse lo.ss than before, for 
it was impossible to get them ovei, and I was re- 
solved not to bleak it down So I set to woik 
again ; and Friday and I. in about two hours’ time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, 
and alxive that with boughs of trees, lieiiig in the 
space without our oiitwaid fence, and between that 
and the grove of young wootl which I had planted , 
and here we made them two beds of such things as 
I had, VIZ, of goo<l iice-straw', with blankets laid 
upon it to he on, and tmothei to cover them, on 
each bed. 

My island was now jieopled, and I thought mvself 
very nch in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection, 
which I fmjueiitly made, how like a king I looked 
First of all, the whole country was my own meie 
pio‘|K;rty, so that I had an undoubted nglit of domin- 
ion. Secondly, my people weic pcifcctly subjected 
I was absolute lord and lawgiver , they all owed then 
lives to me, and were ready to lav down then lives, 
if there had lx;cn occasion of it, for me It was le- 
markablc, too, we had but three subjects, and they 
were of three diffeivnt religions. Mv man Friday 
was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a canni- 
bal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, I 
allowcHl libertv of conscience throughout my domin- 
ions But this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secui'ed my two weak rescued 
prisoners, and given them shelter and a place to rest 
them upon, I began to think of making some pio- 
vision for them , and the first thing I did, I ordered 
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a 
goat, out of iny particular flock, to be killed ; when 
[ 272 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I cut off' the hinder-cjuarter, and chopping it into 
small picres, I set Fnday to work to ooiling and 
stewing, and mode them a very good dish, I assure 
you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley and 
nee also into the broth , and as I cooked it without 
doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I 
carried it all into the new tent, and having set a 
table there for them, I sat down and ate my own 
dinner also with them, and as well as I could cheered 
them, and encouraged them ; Friday being my inter- 
preter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the 
Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language 
of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes and go and fetch 
our muskets and other fireatnis, which, for want of 
time, we had left upon the place of battle ; and the 
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, 
and would presently be offensive , and I also ordered 
him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous 
feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which I 
could not think of doing myself ; nay, I could not 
liear to see them, if I went that w'ay. All which he 
punctually performed, and defaced the very appear- 
ance of tile savages lieing there , so that when I went 
ogam I could scarce know where it w'as, otherwise 
than by the corner of the wood pointing to the 
place. 

I then liegan to enter into a little conversation with 
my two new subjects ; and first, I set Friday to in- 
cpiire of Ins father what he thought of the escape of 
the savages in that canoe, and whcthci we might 
expect a return of them, with a power too great for 
us to re-iist. His fii-st opinion was, that the savages 
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew 
that night they went oft', but must, of necessity, be

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


drowned, or driven south to those otlicr shores, where 
they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be 
drowned if they were cast away. But as to what 
they would do if they came safe on shore, he said 
he knew not ; but it was his opinion that they were 
so dreadfully flighted with the manner of their being 
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed 
they would tell their people they were all killed by 
thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man , and 
that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and me, 
were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to 
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he 
said, he knew, because he heard them all cry out 
so in their language to one anothei , for it was im- 
possible to them to conceive that a man could dart 
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance with- 
out lifting up the hand, a.s was done now And 
this old .savage was in the nght; for, as I understoixl 
since by other hands, the savages nevei attempted 
to go over to the island afterwards. They were st) 
terrified with the accounts given by those four men 
(for, it seems, they did escape the sea), that they 
believed whoever went to that enchanted island would 
lie destrviyed with fire frem the gods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was 
under continual apprehensions for a good while, and 
kept always upon my guard, me and all my army , 
for ns we were now four of us, I would have ven- 
tured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open 
field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appear- 
ing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I oegan 
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main 
into consideration ; being likewi.se assured, by Friday’s 
father, that I might depend upon good usage from 
their nation, on his account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I 

[274J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when 
I understood tliat there were sixteen more of his 
countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast 
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there 
at peace, indeed, with the sasages, but were very 
sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I 
asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and 
found they were a Spanish ship bound from the Rio 
de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to lease 
their loading there, which was chiefly hides and 
silver, and to bring back what European goods they 
could meet with there; that they had five Portu- 
guese seamen on huaid, whom they took out of 
another wreck , that five of their own men were 
drowned when the first ship was lost, and that these 
escaped, through infinite uangei-s and hazards, and 
arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where 
they expected to have lieeii devoured every moment 

He told me they had sonic arms with them, but 
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither 
powder oi ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled 
all their powder but a little, which they used, at 
their first landing, to provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of 
them there, and if they had formed no design of 
making any escape ? He said they had many con- 
sultations about it ; but that having neither vessel, 
or tools to build one, or piovisions of any kind, their 
councils always ended in tears and despair. 

I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
escape ; anti whethei, if they were all here, it might 
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if I put 
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no 
inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men 
always square their dealings by the obligations they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had received, so much as they did bv the advantages 
they expected. I told him it would be very hard 
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, 
and that they should aftcrwaids make me their 
prisoner in Newr Spain, where an Englishman was 
certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what 
accident soever brought him thither , and that I had 
rather be delivered up to the savages, and lie de- 
voured alive, than foil into the merciless claws of 
the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition I 
added, that otherwise I was peisiiaded, if they were 
all here, we might, with so many hands, build a bark, 
large enougli to caiTy us all away, either to the 
Brazils, south waid, or to the islands, or Spanish 
coast, northward , but that if, in re(|uital, they 
should, when I had put weapons into then hands, 
carry me Iw force among their own people, I might 
be ill useci foi my kindness to them, and make my 
case worse than it was before 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and 
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, and 
they were so sensible of it, that he believed they 
would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly 
that should contribute to then deliverfiiice , and that, 
if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, 
and discourse with them about it, and letuin again, 
and bring me their answer , that he would make con- 
ditions with them upon their .solemn oath that they 
should be absolutely under ui\ leading, us their coni- 
inandcr and captain, and that they should swear 
upon the holy .sacraments and the gospel to be true 
to me, and to go to such Christian c-ouiitry as that I 
should agree to, and no other, and to be directed 
wholly and ab.solutcly by iiiy orders till they were 
landed safely in such country as I intended, and 
that he would bring a <-oiitract fiom them, under 
their hands, for that purpose. 

[ 276 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Then he told me he would fii-st swear to me him- 
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he 
lived till I gave him orders ; and that he would take 
my side to the last drop of hit. blood, if there should 
happen the least breach of faith among his country- 
men. 

He told me they were all of them very civil, hon- 
est men, and they were under the greatest distress 
imaginable, having neither weapons or clothes, or any 
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages ; 
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun- 
try , and that he was sure, if I would undertake their 
relief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assuran«*es, I resolved to venture to 
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage 
and this Spaniam over to them to treat. But when 
we had gotten all things m a readiness to go, the 
Spaniaid himself started an objection, which had so 
much prudence in it on one hand, and so much sin- 
cerity on the other band, that I could not but be 
very well satisfied in it, and by his ads ice put oft' the 
deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. 
The case was thus 

He had been with us now about a month, during 
which time I had let him see in what manner I bad 
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my 
support ; and he saw evidently what stock of com 
and nee I had laid up , which, as it was more than 
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least 
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to numbei foui , but much less would it Ixi 
sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, 
fourteen, still alive, should come over ; and least of 
all would it be sufficient to victuid our vessel, if we 
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Chris- 
tian colonies of America. So he told me he thought 
it would be more advisable to let him and the two 
[ 277 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


others dig and cultivate some more land, as much as 
I could spai e seed to sow ; and that we should wait 
another har\cst, that we might have a supply of 
corn for his countrymen when they should come; 
for want might lie a temptation to them to disagree, 
or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than 
out of one difficulty into another. “You know,” 
says he, “the childicii of Israel, though they rejoieed 
at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, 
}et relielled even against God Himself, that deliv- 
ered them, when they came to want bread in the 
wilderness ” 

His caution was so seasonable, and liis advice so 
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with 
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidel- 
ity. So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as 
the wooden tools we were fiirinshed with permitted . 
and in about a month’s time, by the end of which it 
was seed-time, wc had gotten ns much land cured 
and trimmed up as we .sowed twenty-two bushels of 
barley on, and sixteen jars of nee . which was, in 
short, all the seed we had to spnie ; nor, indeed, 
did wc leave ourselves Ijarley siiffieient for our owm 
food for the six months that we liad to exjiect our 
crop , that is to say, reckoning from the time w-e set 
our seed aside for sowing , for it is not to be 
supposed it is six months in the ground in that 
country. 

Having now society enough, and our number be- 
ing sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if 
they had come, unlc.ss their numlier had fieen very 
great, we went freely all over the island, wheicvcr 
wc found occasion , and as here we had our escape 
or deliverance u{)oii our thoughts, it wa.s impossible, 
at least foi me, to have the means of it out of mine 
To this purpose I marked out several trees which I 
thought fit for our work, and 1 set Friday and his

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


father to cutting them down ; and then I caused the 
Spaniard, to whom 1 imparted my thought on that 
affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a 
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to 
do the like, till they had made about a dozen laige 
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-fiie 
feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick. 
What prodigious labour it took up, any one may 
imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to iiKTease my little 
flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and to this 
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one 
day, and myself with Fiiday the next day, for we 
took our turns, and by this means we got above 
twenty young kids to bleed up with the rest ; for 
whenever we .shot the dam, we saved the kids, and 
added them to our flock. But above all, the season 
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a 
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that 
I behove, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins 
of the sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or 
eighty barrels , and these, with oui bread, was a 
great part of our food, and very good living too, I 
assure you , foi it is an exceeding nourishing food 

It was now' harvest, and our crop in good ordei 
It was not the most plentiful increase I had .seen in 
the island, but, howeiei, it was enough to answer our 
end ; for from our twenty-two bushels of barley we 
brought 111 and tin ashed out above two hundred and 
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the 
rice; which was store enough for our food to the 
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had 
been on shore with me , or if we had been ready for 
a voyage, it would veiy plentifully have victualled 
our ship to have earned us to any part of the woild, 
that IS to say, of America. 

f 279] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When we had thus housed and secured our maga- 
zine of corn, wc fell to work to make more wicker- 
work, VIZ . great baskets, in which we kept it ; and 
the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this 
part, and often blamed me that I did not make 
some things for defence of this kind of work ; but I 
saw no need of it. 

And now having a full supply of food for all the 
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go 
over to the main, to .see what he could do vnth 
those he had left behind him there. I gave him a 
stric-t charge in writing not to biing any man with 
him who would not first swear, in the presence of 
himself and of the old savage, that he would no way 
injure, fight with, or attack the person he should 
find in the island, who was so kind to send for them 
in order to their deliverance, but that they would 
stand by and defend him against all such attempts, 
and wherever they went would be entirely under and 
subjected to his commands . and that this should lie 
put'in writing, and signed with their hands. How 
we were to have this done, when I knew they had 
neither pen or ink, that indeed was a question which 
we never asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old 
savage, the father of Enday, went aw'ay in one of the 
cancxis which they might be said to come in, or rather 
were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be 
devouml by the savages 

I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on 
it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, 
charging them to be very good husliands of both, 
and not to use either of them but upon urgent 
occasion 

This was a cheeiful work, being the first nieasui'es 
used by me, in view of my dehveiance, for now 
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them 
[ 280 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


provisions of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for 
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all their 
countrymen for alxmt eight days’ time , and wishing 
them a good voyage, I see them go, agreeing with 
them about a signal they should hang out at their 
return, by which I should know tliein again, when 
they came back, at a distance, before they came on 
shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day that 
the moon was at full, by my account in the month of 
Octobei , but as for an exact reckoning of days, after 
I had once lost it, I could never recover it again ; nor 
had I kept even the number of yeai-s so punctually 
as to be sure that I was right, though as it proveci, 
when I afterwards examined my account, I found I 
had kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for 
them, when a strange and unforeseen accident in- 
tervened, of which the like has not peihap been 
heard of in history. I w'as fast asleep in my hutch 
one morning, when my man Friday came running in 
to me, and called idoud, “ Master, master, they are 
come, they are come ' ” 

I jumped up, and, I'egardless of danger, I went 
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through 
my little giove, which, by the way, was by this time 
grown to be a verv tliick wood , I say, regaixlless of 
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my 
custom to do , but I was surpnsed when, turning my 
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league 
and hairs distance standing in for the shore, with a 
shouldcr-of-imitton sail, as they call it, and the wind 
blowing pretty fair to bring them in ; also I observed 
presently that they did not come from that side 
which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost 
end of the island Upon thi.s I called Friday in, 
and bid him lie close, for these were not the people 
[ 281 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

we looked for, and that we might not know yet 
whether they were friends or enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective 
glass, to see what I could make of them , and having 
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the 
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any- 
thing, and to take my view the plainer, without 
being discovered. 

I had .scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye 
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor at about 
two leagues and an halfs distance from me, south- 
south-cast, but not above a league and an half from 
the shoic By my observation, it appeared plainly 
to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be 
an English longbtiat. 

I cannot expre.ss the confusion I was in , though 
the joy of seeing a ship, and one who I had reason 
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and 
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe. 
But yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I 
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep 
upon my guard. In the fiist place, it occurred to 
me to consider what business an English ship could 
ha\e in that part of the woild, since it was not the 
way to or from any part of the world wdiere the 
English had any traffic, and I knew theie had been 
no storms to dnve them in there as in distre-ss , and 
that if they weie English I'eally, it was most proba- 
ble that they were here upon no good design , and 
that I had better continue as I w'ns, than fall into 
the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of 
danger which sonietimes are given him when he may 
think there is no possibility of its being real. That 
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few 
that have made any observations of things can deny ; 
that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt ; and if 
the tehdency of them seems to be to warn us of dan- 
ger, why should wc not suppose they are from some 
friendly agent, whether supreme, or inferior and sub- 
oi-dinate, is not the question, and that they are given 
for our good S' 

The present question abundantly confirms me in 
the justice of this reasoning, for had I not been 
made cautious by this secret admonition, come it 
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, 
and in a far worse condition than before, as you 
will see presently. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I 
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked 
for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of 
landing. However, as they did not come quite far 
enough, they did not sec the little inlet where I for- 
merly landed my rafts , but run their boat on shore 
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which 
was very happy for me, for otherwise they would 
have landed just, as I may say, at my door, and 
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and 
perhaps ha\e plundei’ed me of all I had. 

When they were on shore,! was fullv satisfied that 
they w ere Englishmen, at least most of them , one or 
two I thought w'cie Dutch, but it did not prove so. 
There were in all eleven men, whereof three of them 
I found weie unarmed, and, as I thought, bound ; and 
when the first four or five of them were jumped on 
shore, they took those three out of the boat, as pris- 
onei-s. One of the three I could perceive using the 
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and 
despair, even to a kind of extravagance ; the other 
two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands some- 
times, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to 
such a degrc'e as the first 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew 
[28S] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called 
out to me in English as well as he could, “ O master ! 
you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage 
mans,” “ WTiy,” says I, “ Fnday, do you think they 
are a-going to eat them then ?” “ Yes,” says Friday, 
“they will eat them.” “No, no,” says I, “Friday, 
I am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you 
may be sure they will not eat them.” 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter 
really was, but stood ti'erabhng with the horror of the 
sight, expecting every moment when the three pris- 
oners should be killctl , nay, once I saw one of the 
villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the 
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor 
men ; and I expected to see him fall every moment, 
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run 
chill in my veins 

I wished heartily now for my Spaniaixi, and the 
savj^c that was gone with him , or that I had any 
way to have come undiscovered w ithiii shot of them, 
that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw 
no firearms they had among them , but it fell out to 
my mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the 
three men by the iihsolent seamen, I observed the 
fellows run scattering about the land, as if they 
wanted to see the country. I observed that the three 
other men had Iibeity to go also where they pleased , 
but they sat down all three upon the ground, veiyr 
pensive, and looked like men in despair. 

This put me 111 mind of the flist time when I came 
on shore, and began to look about me ; how I gave 
myself over for lost ; how wildly I looked round me , 
what dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged 
in the tree all night, for fear of being devoui’ed by 
wild beasts 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was 

[ 284 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to receive by the providential driving of the ship 
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I 
have since been so long nourished and supported ; so 
these three poor desolate men knew nothing how 
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how 
near it was to them, and how effectually and really 
they were in a condition of safety, at the same time 
that they thought themselves lost, and their case 
desperate. 

So little do we see before us in the world, and so 
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the 
great Maker of the world, that lie does not leave His 
creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the 
worst circumstances, they have always something to 
be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their de- 
liverance than they imagine , nay, are even brought 
to their deliverance bv the means by which they seem 
to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high-water when these 
people came on shorri , and w'liile partly they stood 
parleying with the pi isoncrs they brought, and partly 
while they rambled about to see what kind of a place 
they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide 
was spent, and the W’ater was eblied considerably 
away, leaiiiig their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I 
found afterwards, having drank a little too much 
brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them waking 
soonei than the other, and finding the boat too fast 
aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who 
were straggling about, upon which they all soon came 
to the boat , Tint it was past all their strength to 
launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore 
on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a 
quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are per- 
haps the least of all mankind given to forethought, 
[ 285 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


they gave it over, and away they strolled about the 
country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to 
another, calling them off from the boat, “ Why, let 
her alone. Jack, can’t ye ? she will float next tide 
by which I was fully confirmed m the mam inquiry 
of what countrymen they wei-e. 

All this while I kept myself very close, not once 
daring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to 
my place of oliservation near the toj) of the hill , 
and very glad I was to think how well it was forti- 
fied. I knew it w'as no less than ten houis before 
the boat could be on float again, and by that time 
it would be dai k, and I might be at more liberty to 
see their motions, and to bear their discourse if they 
had any. 

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a Imttle, 
as before, though with more caution, knowing 1 had 
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at 
first I ordered Friday also, whom I Inul made an 
excellent marksman with Ins gun, to load himself 
with arms I took myself two fowling-pieces, and 
I gave him three muskets. My figuie, indeed, was 
very fierce. I had ray formidable goat-skin coat on, 
with tlie great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by 
iny side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each 
shoulder. 

It was niy design, as I said above, not to have 
made any attempt till it was dark , but about two 
o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found that, in 
short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, 
and, as I thought, were laid down to sleep. The 
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con- 
dition to get any sleep, were, however, set down 
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter 
of a mile from mo, and, as I thought, out of sight 
of any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, 

[ 286 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and leam something of their condition. Immedi- 
ately I inarched iii tVie figure as above, my man 
Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable 
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a 
spectre-like figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered os I could, and 
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to 
them in Spanish, “ What are ye. gentlemen ? ” 

They started up at the noise, but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the un- 
couth figure that I made. They made no answer at 
all, but I thought 1 perceived them just going to 
fly from me, when I spoke to them in English 
“ Gentlemen,” said I, “ do not be surprised at me ; 
perhaps you may have a fiiend near you, when you 
did not ex|ject it” “He must be sent directly 
from heaven then,” said one of them very gravely to 
me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me, 
“ for our condition is [last the help of man.” “ All 
help is from hea\ eii, sir,” said I “ But can you put 
a stianger m the way how to help you, foi you seem 
to me to be in some gi-eat distress >' I saw you 
when \ou landed , and when you seemeil to make 
applications to the brutes that came with you, I saw 
one of them lift up his sword to kill you.” 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, 
“ Am I talking to God, oi man ? Is it a real man, 
or an angel ? ” “ Be in no fear about that, sir,” 

said I. “ If God had sent an angel to relieve you, 
he w'ould have come better clothed, and armed after 
anothei manner than you sec me in. Pray lay aside 
your fears , I am a man, an Englishman, and dis- 
posed to assist you, you see. I have one servant 
only , w c have arms and ammunition , tell us freely, 
can we serve you ^ What is ^our case ^ ” 

“ Our case,” said he, “ sir, is too long to tell you 
[287] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


while our muiderers are so near; but in short, sir, 
I was commander of that sliip , my men have 
mutinied against me, they have been hardly pre- 
vailed oil nut to murder me; and at last have set me 
on shore in this ilesolate place, « ith these two men 
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where 
we expected to perish, believing the place to be 
uninh^ited, and know nut yet what to think 
of it.” 

“ Where are those brutes, your enemies ? ” said I. 
“ Do you kiio w w liere tliey art* gone ^ ” “ There they 

he, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees “ My 
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and hcaid 
you speak. If they have, they will certainly murder 
us all " 

“ Have they any firearms ?” said I. He answered, 
they had only two pieces, and one which they left 
in the boat. “Well then,” said I, “leaie the rest 
to me, I sec they arc all asleep, it is an easy thing to 
kill them all ; 6iit shall we rather take them pns- 
uners f ” He told me there were tw o desperate vil- 
lains among them that it was scai-ce safe to show any 
mercy to, hut if they were secured, he belicied all 
the rest wouhl return to tlieir duty. I asked him 
which they were ? He told me he could not at tliat 
distance describe them, but he would obc> my orders 
in anything I would diiect “Well,” says I, “let 
us retreat out of their view or hcaiiiig, lest they 
awake, and we will resolve further ” So they wil- 
lingly went back with me, till the woods covered us 
from them. 

“Look you, sir,” said I, “if I venture upon your 
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions 
with me ? ” lie anticipated my proposals, by telling 
me that both he and tlie ship, if recovered, should 
be wholly directed and commanded by me in eveiy- 
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would 
[ 288 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


live and die with me in what part of the world soever 
I would send him ; and the two other men said the 
same. 

“ Well,” says I, “ my conditions are but two. 1. 
That while you stay on this island with me, you will 
not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms 
into your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give 
them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine 
upon this island , and in the meantime, be governed 
by my ordei-s. 2. That if the ship is, or may be, 
recovered, you will carry me and my man to England, 
passage free.” 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention 
and faith of man could devise that he would comply 
with these most reasonable demands ; and, besides, 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon 
all occasions, as long as he lived 

“ Well then,” said I, “ here are three muskets for 
you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what you 
think IS proper to be done.” He showed all the 
testimony of his gratitude that he was able, but 
offei-ed to be wholly guided by me. I told him I 
thought it was hard \entunng anything, but the 
best method I could think of was to fire upon them 
at once, as they lay , and if any was not killed 
at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might 
save them, and .so put it wholly upon God’s 2 irovi- 
dence to direct the shot. 

He said very modestly that he was loth to kill 
them, if he could help it , but that those two were 
incorngible villains, and had been the authoi's of all 
the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should 
be undone still , for they would go on board and 
bring the whole ship’s company, and destroy us all. 
“ Well then,” says I, “ necessity legitimates my ad- 
vice, for it is the only way to save our lives.” How- 
ever, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I 
voi. I — 19 [ 289 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


told him they should go themselves, and manage as 
they found con\enient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of 
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on 
their feet I asked him if either of them were of the 
men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny:* 
He said, “ No.” “ Well then,” said I, “ you may let 
them escape , and ProMdence seems to have wakened 
them on purpose to sa\e themselves Now,” says I, 
“ if the rest escape >oii, it is your fault ” 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had 
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his helt, and 
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece 
111 his hand. 'Phe two men who were with him go- 
ing first made some noise, at which one of the sea- 
men who was awake tinned about, and seeing them 
coming cried out to the rest; but it was too late 
then, for the moment he cried out they filed , I 
mean the two men, the captain wisely rcsening his 
own 'piece They had so well aimed their shot at 
the men they knew, that one of them was killed on 
the spot, and the other veiyi much wounded , but 
not being dead, he staited up upon his feet, and 
called eagerly for help to the other. Hut the cap- 
tain stepping to him, told him ’t was too late to cry 
for help, he should call upon God to forgive his vif- 
lany ; and with that word knoc-ked him down with 
the stock of his musket, so that he nevei spoke more. 
TTiere were three more in the company, and one of 
them was also slightly wounded. By this time I 
was come , and when they saw tlieir danger, and 
that it was in vain to resist, thc> begged for mercy. 
The captain told them he would spare their lives if 
they would give him any assurance of their abhor- 
rence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and 
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the 
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, 
[ 290 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


from whence they came. They gave him all the 
protestations of their sincciity that could be desired, 
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their 
lives, which I was not against, only I obliged him to 
keep them bound hand and foot while they were 
upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the 
captain’s mate to the boat, with onlei-s to secure her, 
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did ; 
and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (hap- 
pily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon 
hearing the guns fired , and seeing their captain, 
who before was their piisoiier, now their conqueror, 
they submitted to be bound also, and so our victory 
was complete 

It now remained that the cajitain and I should in- 
quire into one anothei's cncuinstances I began’ 
first, and told him m\ whole history, which lie heard 
with an attention even to ama/ement , and particu- 
larly at the wondeiful manner of my Ixiing furnished 
with provisions and ammunition . and, indeed, as 
iny story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected 
him deeply. But when he icflccted from thence 
upon himself, and how I seernwl to have been pre- 
served tiieie on pm pose to save his life, the tears 
lan down his face, and he could not speak a word 
more. 

Aftei this coirimuincation was at an end, I carried 
him and his tw'o men into my apartment, leading 
them in just where I came out, viz., at the top of 
the house, where 1 lefieshed them w'ith such provis- 
ions as I had, and showed them all the contrivances 
I had made duiing niy long, long inhabiting that 
place 

All I showed them, all I said to them, w as per- 
fectly amazing , but above all, the captain admired 
my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed 

[ 291 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been 
now planted near twenty years, and the trees grow- 
ing much fastei than in England, was become a lit- 
tle wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in any 
part of it but at that one side where I had reserved 
my little winding passage into it. I told him this 
was my castle and my residence, but that I had a 
seat in the countiy, as most princ“es have, whither I 
could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him 
that too another time , but at present, our business 
was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed 
with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a 
I0S.S what measures to take, for that there were .still six 
and twenty hands on board, who having entered into 
a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited 
their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now 
by desperation, and w ould carry it on, knowing that 
if they were retluced, they should be brought to the 
gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any 
of the English colonies ; and that therefore there 
would be no attacking them with so small a number 
as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he said, and 
found it was a very lational conclusion, and that 
therefore something was to be resolved on very 
speedily, as well to draw the men on board into 
some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their 
landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it 
presently occuned to me that in a little while the 
ship’s crew, wondering what was become of tbeir 
comiarle.s, and of the boat, would certainly come on 
shore in their other boat to see for them ; and that 
then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too 
strong for us. This lie allowed was rational. 

Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do 
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so 
that they might not carry her off, and taking every- 
[ 892 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be 
fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took 
the arms which were left on board out of her, and 
whate\er else we found theie, which was a bottle of 
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a 
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a 
piece of canvas — the sugar was five or six pounds ; 
all which was very welcome to me, especially the 
brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for 
many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore 
(the oars, mast, .sail, and ruddei of the boat were 
carried away before, as above), we knocked a great 
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong 
enough to master us, yet they could not carry off 
the boat. 

Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we 
could be able to recover the ship . but my view was, 
that if they went away without the boat, I did not 
much question to make her fit again to cari'y us 
away to the Leewai'd Islands, and call upon our 
friends the Spaniards m my way, for I had them 
still in my thoughts. 

While we weic thus preparing our designs, and 
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon 
the beacli so higli that the tide would not fleet ncr 
off at high-water mark ; and besides, had broke a 
hole ill her bottom t<K> big to lie quickly stopped, 
and were sat down musing what w^e should do, we 
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw hei make a waft 
with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on 
boanl. But no boat stirred ; and they fired several 
times, making other signals for the boat 

At last, when all then’ signals and firings proved 
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we 
saw them, by the help of niy glasses, hoist another 
boat out, and row towards the shore , and wc found, 
[293 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


as they approached, that there was no less than 
ten men in her, and that they had firearms with 
them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, 
we had a full \ icw of them as they came, and a plain 
sight of the men, even of their faces ; because the 
tide having set them a little to the east of the other 
boat, they ro«ed up under shoie, to come to the 
same place where the other had landed, and where 
the boat lay 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, 
and the captain knew the persons and characters of 
all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there 
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, 
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over- 
powered and frighted , but that as for the boatswain, 
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and 
all the rest, they were as outrageous as an) of the 
ship’s crew, ancf were no doubt mode desperate in 
their new enterpiise, and terribly apprehensive he 
was that they would be too powerful for us 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our 
circumstances weie past the operation of fear , that 
seeing almost every condition that could be was 
lietter than that which we were supposed to be m, 
w'e ought to expect that the conse(]uence, whether 
death or life, would be ‘■ure to be a dclneraiice. I 
asked him what he thought of the ciiciimstaiicos of 
my life, and whether a dclncrance were not woith 
venturing for? “And where, sir,” said I, “ is your 
belief of ni) being preserved hcie on pur|>ose to save 
your life, which elevated )Ou a little while ago ? 
For my part,” said I, “there seems to be but one 
thing amiss m all the prospect of it ” “ What ’s 

that P ” says he. “ Why,” .said I, “ ’t is that, as >ou 
say, there are three or four honest fellows among 
them, which should be spared , had they been all of 
f 294] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the wicked part of the crew I should have thought 
God’s providence had singled them out to deliver 
them into your hands, for depend upon it, every 
man of them that comes ashore are our own, and 
shall die or live as they behave to us.” 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful 
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; so 
we set vigorously to our busin&ss'. We had, upon 
the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the 
ship, considered of sepamting our pnsoiiers, and had, 
indeed, secured them eftectuallv. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured 
than ordinary, I sent with Friday and one of the 
three delivered men to iny cave, where they were re- 
mote enough, and out of danger of being lieai'd or 
discovered, oi of finding tbeir way out of the woods 
if they could hare delivered themselves. Here they 
left them bound, but gave them provisions, and 
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to 
give them then liberty in a day or two , but that if 
they attempted their escajje, they should be put to 
death without mercy 'Fhey promised faithfully to 
liear their confinement with patience, and were ver y 
thankful that they had such good usage as to have 
provisions and a light left them ; for Friday gave 
them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their 
comfort , and they did not know' but that lie stood 
sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The othei pnooners bad better usage. Two of 
them were kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain 
was not free to trust them , but the other two were 
taken into my service, upon their captain’s recom- 
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live 
and die with us , so with them aiuJ the three honest 
men we were seven men well armed ; and I made no 
doubt we should be able to deni well enough with the 
ten that were a-comiiig, considering that the captain 
[ 296J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

had said there were three or four honest men among 
them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other 
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and 
came nil on shore, hauling the boat up after them, 
which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid they w ould 
rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance 
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard 
her, and so we should not be able to sei/e the boat. 

Being on shore, the first thing they did they ran 
all to their other boat , and it was easy to see that 
they were under a great surprise to find her .stripped, 
as above, of all that w'as in her, and a great hole in 
hei bottom. 

After they had mused a while upon this, they set 
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their 
might, to tiy if they could make their companions 
hear ; but all was to no purpose. Then they came 
all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small 
arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made 
the woods ling. But it was all one, those in the 
cave we were sure could not hear, and those in our 
keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst 
give no answer to them. 

'ITiey were so astonished at the surpnse of this, 
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go 
all on boaril again, to their ship, and let them know 
there that the men were all murdered, and the 
longboat staved Accordingly, they immediately 
launched their boat again, and gat all of them on 
board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board the 
ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades for lost, 
and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in 
hopes we should have recovered , but he was quickly 
a, much frighted the other way. 

[ 296 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


They had not been long put off with the boat but 
we pei-ceived them all coming on shore again , but 
with this new measure in their conduct, which it seems 
they consulted together upon, viz., to leave three 
men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and 
go up into the country to look for their fellows 

This was a great disappointment to us, for now we 
were at a loss what to do ; for our seizing those seven 
men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let 
the boat escape, because they would then row away 
to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure 
to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship 
would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to 
wait and see what the issue of things might present 
The seven men came on shore, and the three who 
remained in the boat put her off to a good dis- 
tance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait 
for them , so that it was impossible fur us to come 
at them in the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, 
marching towaids the top of the little hill under 
which my habitation lay , and we could see them 
plainly, though they could not peiceive us. We 
could have bren very glad they would have come 
nearer to us, .so that we migiit have fired at them, or 
that they would have gone farther off', that we might 
have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, 
where they could see a great way into the valleys and 
woods which lay towards the north-east part, and 
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hal- 
looed till they were weary , and not canng, it seems, 
to venture far fiom the shore, nor far from one an- 
other, they sat down together under a tree, to con- 
sider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to 
sleep there, as the other party of them had done, 
they had done the job for us ; but they were too full 

[297 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, 
though they could not tell what the danger was they 
had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon 
this consultation of theirs, viz., that perhaps they 
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make 
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon 
them, just at the juncture when their pieces were all 
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we 
should have them without bloodshed. I liked the 
proposal, provided it was done while we were near 
enough to come up to them before they could load 
their pieces again. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a 
long tune, very irresolute what couise to take At 
length 1 told them there would be nothing to be done, 
in my opinion, till night , and then, if they did not 
return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to 
get between them and the shore, and so might use 
some stratagem with them in the boat to get them 
on shore 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing , and were very uneasy when, aftei 
long consultations, we saw them start all up, and 
march down toward the sea It seems they had 
such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger 
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the 
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and 
so go on with their intcndra voyage with the ship 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, 
I imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had 
given oier their search, and W'ere for going back 
again ; and the captain, as soon as I told him my 
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of 
it ; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch 
them back again, and which answered my end to a 
tittle. 


[ 298 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go 
over the little ci’eek westward, towaids the place 
where the savages came on shore when Friday was 
rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising 
ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them 
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they 
found the seamen heard them ; that as soon as ever 
they heard the seamen answer them, they should 
return it again , and then kec-ping out of sight, take 
a round, always aiisweiing when the other hallooed, 
to draw them as far into the island, and among the 
woods, as possible, and then uheel about again to 
me by suth ways as I directed them. 

They wei’c just going into the boat when Friday 
and the mate hallooed , and they piesently beam 
them, and answering, run along the shore westwaid, 
towards the voice they heaid, when they were pres- 
ently stop[)ed by the creek, wheie the water being 
up, they could not get over, and called for the boat 
to come up and set them over, as, indeed, I expected 

When they ha<l set themselves over, I observed 
that the boat being gone up a good way into the 
creek, and, as it were, in a haibour within the land, 
they took one of the thiee men out of her to go 
along w'lth them, and left only two in tlie boat, 
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on 
the shore. 

ITiat was what I wished foi , and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain’s mate to their busi- 
ness, I took the rest with me, and ciossing the creek 
out of their sight, we surpiised the two men before 
they were aware , one of them lying on shore, and 
the other being in the lioat. The fellow on shore 
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start 
up. The captain, who was foremost, ran in upon 
him, and knocked him down, and then called out to 
him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. 
[ 299 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


There needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield when he saw five men upon him, 
and his comrade knocked down ; besides, this was, it 
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in 
the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was 
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to 
join very sincerely with us. 

In the meantime, Friday and the captain’s mate 
so well managed their business with the lest, that 
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from 
one hill to another, and from one wood to another, 
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them 
where they were very sure they could not reach back 
to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they 
were heartily tired themselves also by the time they 
came back to us. 

We Inul nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make 
sure work witli them 

Itr was several hours after Friday came bock to me 
before they came back to their boat , and we could 
hear the lorcniost of them, long before they came 
quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and 
could also hear them answer and complain how lame 
and tired they were, and not able to come any fa.ster , 
which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat ; but ’t is 
impossible to express their confusion when they 
found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide 
ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could 
hear them call to one another in a most lamentable 
manner, telling one another they were gotten into 
an enchanted island , that either there were inhabi- 
tants in it, and thev should all be murdered, or else 
there were devils and spirits in it, and they should 
be all earned away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two com-

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


rades by their names a great many times ; but no 
answer. After some time we could see them, by the 
little light there was, run about, wringing their 
hands like men in despair, and that sometimes they 
would go and sit down in the boat to rest thein- 
selvas ; then come ashoie again, and walk about 
again, and so the same thing over again. 

My men would fam have me give them leave to 
fall upon them at once in the dark. , but I vvas will- 
ing to take them at some advantage, so to spare 
them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and espe- 
cially I w'as unwilling to hazard the killing any of 
our own men, knowing the other were very well 
armed I lesolved to wait, to .see if they did not 
separate , and, therefore, to make sure of them, I 
drew ray ambu-scade nearei, and ordered Friday and 
the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as 
close to the ground as they could, that they might 
not be discovered, and get as near them as they 
could possibly, Ijefore thc\ offered to file. 

They had not been long in that posture but tliat 
the boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of 
the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most 
dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking 
towards them, with two more of their crew. The 
captain was so eager, as having this principal rogue 
so much in his powei, that he could hardly have 
patience to let him conic so near as to be sure of 
him, for they only heal'd his tongue before , but 
when they came nearer, the captain and Fiidaj, 
starting up on their feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next 
man was shot into the ImkIv, and fell just by him, 
though he did not die till an hour or two after ; and 
the third ran for it 

At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced 
with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz., 
[301 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


myself, generalissimo ; Friday, niy lieutenant-gen- 
eral ; the captain and his tv\u men, and the three 
prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with arms. 

We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that 
they could not see our number ; and I made the 
man we had left in the boat, who was now one of 
us, call to them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce 
them to teims, which fell out just as we desired , 
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition 
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate. 
So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them, 
“Tom Smith ' Tom Smith'” Tom Smith answered 
immediately, “ Who ’s that ^ Robinson ^ ” For it 
seems he knew his voice. The other answered, “ Ay, 
ay ; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your 
arms and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment.” 

“Who must we yield to? Where aie they?” 
says Smith again “Ileie they are,” sajs he, 
“fiere’s our captain, and fifty men with him, have 
been hunting you this tw'o houi> ; the boatswain is 
killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; 
and if you do not yield, you are all lost.” 

“ Will they give us quarter then,” says Tom 
Smith, “ and we will yield ? ” “I ’ll go and ask, if 
you promise to yield,” says Robinson. So he asked 
the captain, and the captain then ctdls hiiiKself out, 
“ You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down 
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have 
your fives, all but Will Atkins.” 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s 
.sake, captain, give me quarter; what have I done? 
They have been all as bad ns 1 , ” which, by the 
way, was not true neither, for, it seems, this Will 
Atikins was the first man that laid hold of the cap- 
tain when they first mutinied, and used him bt^

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


barously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious 
language. However, the captain told him he must 
lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the 
governor’s mercy , by which he meant me, for they 
all called me governor. 

In a word, they nil laid down their arms, and 
begged their lives , and I sent the man that had 
parleyed with them and two more, who bound them 
all ; and then my great army of fifty men, which, 
particularly with those thi-ee, were all but eight, 
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their 
boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out of 
sight for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think 
of seizing the ship , and as for the captain, now he 
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated 
with them upon the villainy of their practices with 
him, and at leii^h u|)oii the farther wickedness of 
their design, and how certainly it must bring them 
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to 
the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard 
for their lives. As for that, he told them thev were 
none of his prisoners, but the commander I'f the 
island, that they thought they had set him on 
shoie in a Iwirreii, uninhabited island , but it had 
pleased God so to direct them that the island w'as 
inhabited, and that the governor was an English- 
man ; that he might hang them all there, if he 
pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he 
supposed he would send them to England, to be 
dealt with there as Justice required, except Atkins, 
whom he was commandeil by the governor to advise 
to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged 
in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it 
had its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees, 
[303 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to beg the captain to intercede ^vith the governor 
for his. life , and all the rest Ijegged of him, for God’s 
sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurretl to me that the time of our de- 
liverance was come, and that it would be a most 
easy thing to bi mg these fellows in to be hearty in 
getting possession of the ship . so I retired in the 
dark fiom them, that they might not sec what kind 
of a governor they hatl, and called the captain to 
me. When I called, as at a good distance, one of 
the men was ordci-cd to speak again, and say to the 
captain, ‘"Ca[itain, the commander calls for you.” 
And presently the captain replied, “Tell his ex- 
cellency I am just a-coming” Ibis more perfectly 
aiiiusea them, and they all believed that the com- 
mander was just by with his fifty men. 

Upon the captain’s coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which he liked of won- 
derfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the 
next ulorning. But in order to execute it with more 
art, and secure of success, I told him wc must divide 
the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins 
and two more of the worst of them, and send them 
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This 
was committed to Friday and the two men who 
came on slior<> with the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a pnson. 
And it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men 
in their condition The othere I ordered to my 
Ixiwer, as I called it, of which I have given a full 
description , and as it was fenced in, and they pin- 
ioned, the place was secure enough, considering they 
were upon their bchavioiii. 

To tnese in the morning I .sent the captain, who 
was to enter into a parley with them , in a word, 
to try them, and tell me whether he thought they 
might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the ship He talked to them of the injury done 
him, of the condition they were brought to , and 
that though the governor had given them quarter 
for their lives as to the present action, vet that 
if they were sent to England they woul({ all be 
hanged in chains, to bo sure , but tiiat if they would 
join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, 
he would have the governor’s engagement for their 
pai'don. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
would be accepted by men in their condition. ITiey 
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, 
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be 
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they .should 
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all 
over the world ; that they would own him foi a father 
to them as long as they lived. 

“ Well,” says the captain, “ I must go and tell 
the governor what you sav, and sc>e what I can do 
to bring him to consent to it.” So he brought me 
an account of the temper he found them in, and that 
he verily believed they would lie faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told 
him he should go back again and choose out five of 
them, and tell them they might see that he did not 
want men, that he would take out those five to lie 
his assistants, and that the govcrnoi would keep the 
other two and the thi-ee that wen' sent prisoners to 
the castle, my cave, as hostages foi the fidelity of 
those five, and that if they proved unfaithful in 
the execution, the five hosbiges should be hanged 
in chains alive upon the shore. 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the 
governor was in earnest. However, they had no way 
left them but to accept it ; and it was now the busi- 
ness of the prisoners as much as of the captain, to 
persuade the other five to do their duty. 

VOL. I. — SO [ 305 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Our strength was now thus ordered for the e3&- 
pedition. 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 
2. Then the two prisoners of the fiist gang, to whom, 
having their characters from the captain, I had given' 
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. 'ITie 
other two whom I had kept till now in my bower, 

I iinioned, but upon the captain'’s motion had now re- 
eased. 4. These five released at last , so that they 
were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in 
the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture 
with these hands on board the ship , for as for me 
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper 
for us to stir, having seven men left behind, ami it 
was employment enough for us to keep them asunder 
and supply them with victuals As to the five in 
the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday 
went in twice a day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries, and I made the other tw o carry provis- 
ions' to a certain distance, where Fiiday was to take 
it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was 
with the captain, who told them I was the peiMin 
the governor had ordcied to look after them, and 
that it was the goveinoi’s pleasure they should not 
stii anywhere but by my direction , that if they did, 
they should be fetched into the castle, and lx; laid 
in irons , so that as we never suffered them to see 
me as governor, so I now appeared as another per- 
son, and spoke of the goveiiior, the garrison, the 
castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him but 
to furnisli his two boats, stop the breach of one, 
and man them, lie made his passenger captain of 
one, with four other men , and himself, and his mate, 
and five more went in the other , and they contrived 
their business very well, for they came up to the

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ship about midnight. As soon as they came within 
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and 
tell them they had brought off the men and the 
boat, but that it was a long time before they had 
found them, and the like, bolding them in a chat 
till they came to the ship’s side ; when the captain 
and the mate entering first, with their arms, immedi- 
ately knocked down the second mate and carpenter 
with the butt-end of tlieii muskets, being very faith- 
fully seconded by their men. They secured all the 
rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and 
began to fasten the hatches to keep them down who 
were below ; when the other boat and their men 
entenng at the fore-chains, seemed the forecastle 
of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into 
the cook-room, making three men they found there 
prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the 
captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break 
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain 
lay, and having taken the alarm was gotten up, and 
with two men and a boy had gotten flieaims in theii 
hands ; and when the mate with a t row split open 
the dooi, the new' captain and his men fired boldly 
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket- 
ball, which broke liis ai in, and wounded two more of 
the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate calling foi help, rushed howcvei into the 
round-house wounded as he was, and w ith his pistol 
shot the new captain through the head, the bullet 
entering at his mouth and came out again behind 
one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word , upon 
w'hich the rest yielded, and the ship was taken 
effectually, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain 
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal 
agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, 

[ 307 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, 
having sat watching upon the shore tor it till near 
two of the clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me 
down , and it having been a day of great fatigue to 
me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur- 
pnsed with the noise of a gun ; and presently start- 
ing up, I heard a man call me by the name of 
“ Governor,” “ Governor,” and presently I knew the 
captain’s voice, «hen climbing up to the top of 
the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, 
lie embraced me in his arms. “ My dear friend and 
deliverer,” says he, “ there ’s your ship, for she is all 
yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her ” 
I cast my eyes to the ship, and thcic she rode within 
little more than half a mile of the shore ; for they 
had weighed her anchor as scam as they w ere masters 
of her, and the weather being fair, had brought her 
to an anchor just against the mouth of the little 
creek, and thetiile lieiiig up, the captain had brought 
the pinnace in near the place where I at firet landed 
my rafts, and so landeil just at my door. 

I was at firet ready to sink down with the surprise , 
for I saw my deliverance, indeed, Msibly jiut into my 
hands, all things easy, and a laige ship just leadv to 
carry me away whither I pleased to go. At fiist, 
for some time, I was not able to answer him one 
woid, but as he had taken me in his arms, 1 held 
fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground 

He perceived the surpiise. and immediately pulls 
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of 
cordial, which he had brought on puipose for me. 
After I had diank it, I sat down upon the ground ; 
and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a 
good while before I could s})eak a word to him. 

All this while the poor man w^as in as great an 
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was ;

and he said a thousand kind tciidei things to me, to 
compose me and bring mo to in \ self. But such was 
the flood of joy in my hi east, that it put all my spirits 
into contusion At last it bioke out into tears, and 
in a little while aftei I locoieiod iny speech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my 
deliverer, and we rejoicetl together. I told him I 
looked upon him as a man sent fiom hea\en to de- 
liver me, and that the whole tiansaction seemed to 
be a chain of woiidei’s , that sin h things as these 
were the testimonies «c had of a seciet hand of Pro- 
vidence governing the world, and an evidcnci> that 
the eyes of an infinite Power tould search into the 
remotest corner of the world, and send help to the 
miserable whenever He pleased

who had not only in a miiaculoiis niiumcr piovidcd 
for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desoliilo 
condition, but from wliom every delneiancc must 
always be acknowledged to proceed '' 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me 
he had brought me some little lefrcshment, such as 
the .ship afforded, and .such as the wi etches that had 
been so long his roasters had not pluiideml him of 
Upon this he called aloud to tlie bout, and hid his 
men bring the things ashore that were for the gov-

one, not that was to be earned away along with 
them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island 
.still, and they were to go without me 

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of 
excellent coi’dial waters, six large bottles of Madeiia 
wine (the bottles held two quarts apiece), two pounds 
of excellent good tobacco, twclv e good pieces of the 
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, w ith a bag of peas,

of clothes of ills own, which had been worn but very 
little , in a word, he clothed me fiom head to foot. 

It was a very kind and agi’ceable present, as any 
one may imagine, to one in niv cireumstances , but 
never was anything in the woild of that kind so un- 
pleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to 
wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his 
good things vveie biougbt into my little apartment, 
we began to consult what was to be done with the 
prisoners we had , foi it was worth considenng 
whether we might venture to take them away with 
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to 
be incoirigihle and lefiactoiy to the last degive , and 
the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that 
there was no obliging them , and if he did cairy 
them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to 
be delivered over to justice at the fii-st English 
colony* he could come at , and I found that the cap- 
tain himself was very anxious about it 

Upon this I told him that, if he desired it, I 
duist uiideitake to bring the two men he spoke of 
to make it their own I'cqucst that he should leave 
them upon the island. “ I should he very glad of 
that,” says the captain, “ with all my beait.” 

“Well,” sajs I, “I will send for them up, and 
talk with them for you.” So I caused Friday and 
the two hostages, for they were now discharged, 
their comrades having performed their promise; I 
say, I caused them to go to the cave and bring up 
[ 310 ]

the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, 
and keep them there till I came. 

After some time I came thither, dressed in my 
new habit ; and now I was called governor again. 
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused 
the men to be brought before me, and I told them I 
had had a full account of then villainous behavioui 
to the captain, and how they had run away with the 
ship, and were preparing to commit farther robberies, 
but that Providence had ensnared them in their own 
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which 
they had digged for othei’s 

I let them know that by my direction the ship 
had been seized, that she lay now in the road, and 
they might see, by-and-by, tliat their new captain 
had received the reward of his villainy, for that they 
might see him hanging at the > aid-arm , that as to 
them, I wanted to know what tliey had to say why 
I should not execute them as piiates, taken in the 
fact, as by niy commission they could not doubt 
I had authonty to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest 
that they had nothing to say but this, that when 
they were taken the captain promised them then 
lives, and they huinlilv implored my mercy. But I 
told them I knew not what meicyto show them, 
for as for myself, I had re-solved to ijint the island 
with all my men, and had taken passage- with the 
captain to go for England. And as for the captain, 
he could not carry them to England otliei than a- 
pri-'oners in irons, to lx; tried for mutiny, and run- 
ning away with the ship ; the conseqiieni-e of which, 
they must needs know, would bt- the gallows, so 
that I could not tell which was best for tliem, unless 
they had a mind to take their fate in the island 
If they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty 
to leave it. I had some inclination to giie them

their lives, if they thought they could shift on 
shore. 

They seemed very thankful for it, said they would 
much rather venture to stay there than to be carried 
to England to be hanged ; so I left it on that issue. 

Howevei, the captain seemed to make some diffi- 
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there 
Upon this I seemetl a little angry with the captain, 
and told him that they were niv prisonei’s, not his , 
and that seeing I hod offered them so much favour, 
I would be as good as iny word , and that if he did 
not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at 
liberty, as I found them , and if he did not like it, 
he might take them again if he could latch them. 

Upon this they appcai-ed veiy thankful, and I 
accordingly set them at lilierty, and bade them re- 
tire into the woods to the place whence the) came, 
and I would leave them some firearms, some ammu- 
nition, and some directions Jiow they should live 
very .well, if they thought fit 

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but 
told the captain that I would stay that night to pre- 
pare my things, and desirwl him to go on board in 
the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and 
send the boat on shore the next day for me , order- 
ing him, in the incautinic, to cause the new captain, 
who was killed, to be haiigc>d at the yard-arm, that 
these men might see him. 

When the cafitain was gone, I sent for the men up 
to me to my ajjartineiit, and entered scnomsly into 
discourse with them of their cii’cunistanc’e.s. I told 
them I thought they li»«l made a light choice , that 
if the captain earned them away, they would cer- 
tainly be hanged. I showctl them the new captain 
hanging at the yaid-anii of the ship, and told them 
they had nothing less to expect. 

When they hail all dc'clai-c-d their willingness to

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


stay, I then told them I would let them into the 
story of in\ living there, and put them into the 
way of making it easy to them Acconhiigly I gave 
them the whole history of the place, and of my com- 
ing to it, showed them my fortifications, the way I 
made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes , 
and in a word, all that was necessaiy to make tliem 
easy. I told them the story also of the sixteen 
Spaniards that were to be exjiectcd, foi whom I left 
a lettei', and made them piomisc to treat them in 
common with themselves. 

I left them my firearms, \iz, fiie muskets, three 
fowling-pieces, and thi'ce swords. I had above a 
bant:l anfl half of powder left, for after tlie first 
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I 
gave tlicm a description of the way I managed the 
goats, and diiectioiis to milk and fatten them, and 
to make both butter and cheese 

In a w'ord, I gave them every part of iny own story, 
and I told them I would pievail with the captain to 
leave them two barrels ot gunpowder more, and some 
garden seeds, which I told them I wtmld have been 
very glad of Also I gave them the bag of peas 
whicli the captain had brought me to eat, and bade 
them be sure to sow and iiiciease them 

Having done all tins, I left them tlie next day, and 
went on boaid the ship We prepared immediately 
to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next 
morning early two of the five men cviine swimming 
to the ship’s side, and making a most lamentable com- 
plaint of the otliei tlnx-c. begged to be taken into the 
ship for God’s sake, for they .should be murdcied, 
and begged the captain to take them on* heal'd, 
though he hanged them immediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power 
without me , but after some difficulty, and after their 
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on

board, and were some time after soundly whipped and 
pickled, after which they proved veiy honest and 
quiet fellows. 

Some time after this the boat was ordered on 
shore, the tide lieing up, with the things pramised to 
the men, to which the captain, at my intcrces.sion, 
caused their chests and clothes to he added, which they 
took, and were veiy thankful for. I also encouraged 
them by telling them that if it la> in my way to send 
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on 
board, for relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, 
my umbiella, and my parrot; also I forgot not to 
take the money I formerly mentioned, which hatl lain 
by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tar- 
nished, and could hanlly pass for silver till it hail 
been a little rubbed and handled ; ns also the money 
I found in the w'icck of the Spanish shij) 

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, 
as Hound by the ship’s account, in the >car 1686, 
after I had iK'eti upon it eight and twi>nty yeais, two 
months, and nineteen days, being delivered from this 
second captivity tlie same day of the month that I 
first made my escape in the barco-hngo, from among 
the Moois of Sallee. 

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in 
England, the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having 
been thirty and hvc years absent. 

When I came to England, I was its perfec't a 
stranger to all the world as if I had never been 
known there. My benefactor and faithful steward, 
whom I had left in trust with my money, was alive, 
but had had great misfortunes in the world, was be- 
come a widow the second time, and very low in the 
w orld. I made lier ea.sy as to what she owed me, as- 
suring her I would give her no trouble ; but on the 
contrary, in giatitude to her former care and faith- 
[314] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


fulness to me, I relieved her as iny little stock would 
afford ; which, at that time, would indeed allow me 
to do but little for her , but I assured her I would 
never forget her former kindness to me, nor did I 
forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall 
be observed in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my 
father was dead, and my mother and all the family 
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of 
the children of one of my brothers; and as I had 
been long ago given over for dead, there had been 
no provision made for me ; so that, in a word, 1 found 
nothing to relieve or assist me , and that little money 
I had would not do much for me as to settling in 
the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I 
did not expect , and this was, that the master of the 
ship whom I had so happily delivered, and by the 
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given 
a very handsome account to the owners of the man- 
ner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship, 
they invited me to meet them, and some other mer- 
chants concerned, and all together made me a very 
handsome compliment upon the subject, and a pres- 
ent of almost £^00 sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the cir- 
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would 
go towaids settling me in the world, I resolved to go 
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some 
information of the state of my plantation in the 
Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who 
I had reason to suppose had some years now given 
me over for dead. 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where 
I arrived in April following , my man Friday accom- 
panying me very honestly in all these ratnblings, and 
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions. 

[ 315 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiiy, 
and to my particular satisfaction, my old /'riend the 
captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off 
of the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and 
had left off the sea, having put his son, who was far 
from a young man, into his ship, and who still used 
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; 
and, indeed, I hardly knew him , hut I soon hi ought 
him to my I'emembrancc, and as soon brought my- 
self to his remembrance when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old ac- 
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my 

E lantation and my partner. The old man told me 
e had not been in the Biazils for about nine years ; 
but that he could assure me that, when he came 
away, my partner was living ; but the trustees, whom 
I hM joined with him to take cognisanc-e of my part, 
were math dead. That, however, he believed that I 
would have a very good account of the impiovement 
of"the plantation , for that upon the general belief 
of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had 
given in the account of the produce of my pait of 
the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had ap- 
propnated it, in case I never came to claim it, one- 
thud to the king, and two-thiids to the monastery 
of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of 
the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to 
the Catholic faith , but that if I appeared, or any 
one for me, to claim the inheritance, it should be 
restored , only that the improvement, or annual pro- 
duction, being distributed to chantable uses, could 
not be restored But he assured me that the steward 
of the king’s revenue from lands, and the provedidore, 
or steward of the monastery, had taken great care 
all along that the incumbent, that is to say, my 
partner, gave every year a faithful account of the 
produce, of which they received duly my moiety. 
■[ 316 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I asked him if he knew to what height of im- 
provement he had brought the plantation, and 
whether he thought it might lie wortn looking after , 
or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with 
no obstruction to my possessing my just right in 
the moiety. 

He told me he could not tell exactly to what 
degree the plantation was improved ; but this he 
knew, that my partner was growing exceeding rich 
upon the enjoying but one-half of it ; and that, to 
the best of his remembrance, he had heaid that the 
king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, gi’anted 
away to some other monastery or religious house, 
amounted to above two hundred inoidorcs a year. 
That as to my being restored to a ijuiet possession 
of it, there was no question to lx: made of that, my 
partnei being alive to witness my title, and my 
name being also chioUihI in the register of the 
country. Also he told me that the survivors of my 
two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very 
wealthy, and he believed I would not only have 
their assistance for putting me in possession, but 
would find a very considerable sum of money in their 
hands foi my account, Ix-iiig the produce of the 
farm while their fathers held the trust, and before 
it was given up, as above , which, as he remembered, 
was for alxMit twelve vears. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at 
this account, and iiK[iiiiwl of the old captain how 
it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose 
my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, 
and had made him, the Portuguase captain, my 
universal heir, &c. 

He told me, that was true ; but that os there was 
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exec- 
utor until some certain account should come of my 
death , and that besides, he was not willing to in- 

[ 317 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


termcddle with a thing so remote ; that it was true 
he had registered my will, and put in his claim , 
and could he have given any account of my being 
dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration, 
and taken possession of the ingenio, so they called 
the sugar-house, and had given his son, who was 
now at the Bra/ils, order to do it. 

“But,” says the old man, “I have one piece of 
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ac- 
ceptable to you as the rest , and that is, that believ- 
ing you were lost, and all the world believing so 
also, vour partner and trustees did oiler to account 
to me, in your name, for six or eight of the first 
years of profits, which I received , but there being 
at that time,” says he, “ great disbursements for in- 
creasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying 
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as after- 
wards it produced. However,” says the old man, 
“I shall give you a true account of what I have re- 
ceived in all, and how I have disposed of it.” 

After a few days’ farther conference with this 
ancient fnend, he brought me an account of the six 
first years’ income of niy plantation, signed by my 

f iartner and the merchant-tnistees, being always de- 
ivercd in goods, viz , tobacco in roll, and sugar in 
chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the con- 
sequence of a sugar-work , and I found, by this 
account, that every year the income considerably 
increased, but, as above, the disbursement being 
large, the sum at first was small. However, the 
old man let me see that he was debtor to me 470 
moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of sugar, and 15 
double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, 
he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, 
about eleven years after my leaving the place. 

The good man then began to complain of his mis- 
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use 
[318] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a 
share in a new ship. “ However, iny old fncnd,” 
says he, “you shall not want a supply in your 
necessity ; and as soon as niy son returns, you shall 
be fully satisfied." 

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 
160 Portugal raoidorcs in gold , and giving me the 
writing of his title to the ship, which his son was 
gone to the Brazils in, of which ne was a quarter-part 
ow'ner, and his son another, he puts them both into 
my hands for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kind- 
ness of the poor man to be able to bear this , and 
remembering what he had done for me, how he had 
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used 
me on all occasions, and particulaily how sincere a 
fneiid he was now to me, I could haitlly refrain weep- 
ing at what he said to me , therefore first 1 asked 
him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so 
much money at that tune, and if it would not straiten 
him ? He told me he could not say but it might 
straiten him a little , but, however, it was my money, 
and I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affec- 
tion, and I could haidly refrain from tears while 
he spoke , in short, I took 100 of the moidores, and 
called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for 
them. Then I leturned him the rest, and told him 
if ever I had possession of the plantation, I w'ould 
return the other to him also, as, indeed, I afterwanls 
did , and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his 
son’s ship, I would not take it by any means ; but 
that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest 
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to 
receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would 
never have a penny more from him. 

When this was pas.sed, the old man began to ask 
[319] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


me if he should put me into a method to make my 
claim to my plantation P I told him 1 thought to 
go over to it myself. He said I might do so if I 
pleased ; but that if I did not, there were ways 
enough to secuie iny right, and iinmedmtcly to 
appropriate the piofits to my use; and as there were 
ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away 
to Brazil, he made me enter iny name in a public 
register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that 
I was alive, and that I was the same peison who took 
up the land for the planting the said plantation at 
first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a 

I irocuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a 
etter of his writing, to a nierehant of his acquaint- 
ance at the place, and then proposed my staying with 
him till an account came of the return 

Never anything Was more honourable than the pio- 
cccdings upon this procuration , for in less than seven 
months I received a large packet from the survivors 
of my tiustees, the merchants, for whose account I 
went to sea, in which were the following particular 
letters and pajiers enclosed 

First, there was the account-current of the prod- 
uce of my fin’ll] or plantation fiom the year when 
their fathei’s had lialanced with my old Portugal 
captain, being for six years, the balance appeared 
to be 1174 inoidores in my favour. 

Swoiidlv, there was the account of four years 
more, while they kept the effects in their hands, be- 
fore the government claimed the ailministration, as 
being the effects of a person not to be found, which 
they called civil death , and the balance of this, the 
value of the plantation increasing, amounted to 
38,892 crusadoas, which made 3241 moidorcs. 

Tliirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines’ 
account, who had received the prefits for above 
[ 320] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


fourteen years ; but not being to account for what 
was disposed to the hospital, very hoiiestU declared 
he hiul 872 nioidorcs not distributed, which he ac- 
knowledged to niv account ; as to the king’s part, 
that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of niy partner’s, congratulating 
me very affectionately upon niy being alive, giving 
me an account how the estate was improved, and 
what it produced a ycai, with a particular of the 
number of stjuaies or acres that it contained ; how 
jilantcd, how many slaves there were upon it, and 
making two and twenty crosses for blessings, told 
me he had said so many Ave MarioJi to thank the 
blessed Virgin that I was alive, inviting me very 
passionately to come over and take possession of my 
own , and in the uK'aiitinie, to give liim orders to 
whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not 
come myself, concluding with a hearty tendei of his 
friendship, and that of his family , and sent me as a 
present seven fine leopaids’ skins, which he had, it 
seems, received fiom Ahica by some other ship which 
he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had made a 
better voyage than I. lie sent me also five chests 
of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of 
gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By 
the same fleet, my two merchant trustees shipped 
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 lolls of tobacco, and 
the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end 
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impossi- 
ble to express the flutterings of my very heart when 
I looked over these letters, and especially when I 
found all my wealth about me , for ns the Brazil 
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which bi ought 
my letters brought mv goods, and the effects were 
safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. 
Ill a word, I turned pale, and grew sick ; and had

not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I be- 
lieve the sudden surprise of joy had overset Nature, 
and I had died upon the spot. 

Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was so 
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and some- 
thing of the real cause of my illness being known, 
he oixlered me to be let blood, after which I had re- 
lief, and grew well, but I vcnly belieie, if it had 
not been ea.sed by a vent given in that manner to 
the spirits, I should have died 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above i?5000 
sterling in money, and had an estate, a.s I might well 
call it, in the Brazils of above a thousand pounds a 
year, as sure as an estate of lands in England , and 
in a woid, I was in a condition which I scai ce knew 
how to understand, or how to compose myself for the 
enjoyment of it. 

The first thing I did was to recompense my origi- 
nal benefactor, my good old captain, wlio had been 
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in 
my beginning, and honest to me at the end. 1 
showed him all that was sent me. I told him that, 
next to the pravideiice of Heaven, which disposes all 
things, it wa.s owing to him , and that it now lay on 
me to rewal’d him, which I would do a hundredfold. 
So I first returned to him the hundred inoidores I 
had received of him , then I sent for a notary, and 
caused him to draw up a general release or disc’harge 
for the 470 nioidorcs which he had acknowledged he 
owed me in the fullest and firmest manner possible ; 
after which I caused a pi’ocuration to be drawn, em- 
powering him to be my I’eceiver of the annual profits 
of my plantation, and appointing my partner to ac- 
count to him, and make the returns by the usual 
fleets to hi in in my name ; and a clause in the end, 
being a grant of 100 inoidores a year to him, during 
his life, out of the efiects, and 50 moidores a year to

his son after him, for his life ; and thus I requited 
my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my 
course next, and what to do with the estate that 
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in- 
deed, I had more care upon iny head now than I had 
in my silent state of life in the island, where I 
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted , whereas I had now a great 
charge upon me, and my business was how to secure 
it. I had ne’er a cave now to hide my money in, or 
a place where it might lie without lock or Key till 
it grew mouldy and famished before anybody would 
meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew not where 
to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, 
the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the 
only refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils 
seemed to summon me thither, but now I could 
not tell how to think of going thither till I had 
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe 
hands behind me. At first I thought of ray old 
friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would 
be just to me ; but then .she was in years, and but 
poor, and for aught I knew might be in debt ; so 
that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to 
England myself, and take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved 
upon tbis , and therefore, as I had rewarded the old 
cAptain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been 
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor 
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, 
and she, while it was in her power, ray faithful 
steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I 
got a merchant in Lisbon to wnte to his corre- 
spondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to 
eo find her out, and carrv her in money an hundred 
[ 823 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort 
her in her poierty, by telling her slie should, if 
I lived, have a furthei supply. At the same time I 
sent my two si^teis in the country each of them an 
hundred pounds, they being, though not in want, 
yet not in very good ciicumstances , one having been 
man led, and left a widow; and the other having a 
husband not so kind to her as he should be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I 
could not yet pitch upon one to w horn I ilurst com- 
mit the gross of my.stiK-k, that I might go away to 
till* Bta/ils, and leave things safe bc'hind me , and this 
gieatly perplexed me. 

I hml once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and 
have settled myself thei-e, foi I was, as it were, 
naturalised to the plate. But I hiul some little 
seiuplc in my mind about lehgion, which inscnsihlv 
drew me back, of which I shall say more piesently. 
However, it was not religion that kept me liom 
going there for the present , and as I had made no 
scruple of Ixjing openly of the religion of the touiitry 
all the while I was among them, so neither did 1 
yet , only that, now and then, having of lale thought 
moie of it than formeily, when I began to think of 
living and dvnig among them, I began to legiet my 
having professed myself a papist, and thought it 
might not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that 
leallv I did not know with whom to leave iiiv effects 
behind me , so I resolved, at last, to go to Plngland 
with it, wliei-c, if I ainved, I concluded I should make 
some acquaintance, or find some lelations, that would 
be faithful to me , and accordingly I prepared to go 
for England with all iny wealth 

In ordei to prcpuie things for my going home, I 
lint, the Brazil fleet being |ust going aviav, resolved 
[ 824 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to give answers suitable to the just and faithful ac- 
count of things I had from thence. And first, to 
the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of 
thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 
872 inoidores which was undisposed of, which I de- 
sired might be given, 500 to the monastery, and 372 
to the poor, as the prior should direct, desiring the 
good padre's prayers fur me, and the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thiuiks to iny two trustees 
with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and 
honesty called for. As for sending them any present, 
they were far above having any occasion of it. 

I^astly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his 
industry in the improving the plantation, and his in- 
tegrity in increasing the stock of the works, giving 
him instructions for hi.s future government of my part, 
according to the powers I had left with my old patron, 
to whom I desii’ed him to send whatever became due 
to me till he should hear from me more particularly ; 
assuring him that it was my intention not only to I'ome 
to liini, but to settle myself there for the remainder 
of my life. To this I added a very handsome present 
of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughter, 
for such the captain’s son informed me he had, with 
two pieces of fine English bi oadcloth, the best I could 
get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some 
Flanders lace of a good value 

Having thus settled my affaire, sold my cargo, and 
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my 
next difficulty was which way to go to England. I 
had been acciistoined enough to the sea, and yet I had 
a strange aversion to going to England by sea at 
that time ; and though I could give no reason for it, 
yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that 
though I had once shipped my baggage in oidcr to 
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but 
two or three times. 

[ 326 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


It is true I had been very unfortunate sea, and 
this might be some of the reason ; but Jet no man 
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in 
cases of such moment Two of the ships which I had 
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled 
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of 
them to put ni} things on board, and in the other to 
have agreed with the captain , I say, two of these 
ships iniscanied, vi/., one was taken by the Algeniies, 
and the other was cast away on the Start, near Tor- 
bay, and all the people arowned except three, so 
that in either of those vessels I had been made 
miserable , and in which most, it was hard to 
say. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old 
pilot, to whom I communicated evciy thing, jircssed 
me earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by 
land to the Groyne, and cioss o\er the Bay of Bis- 
cay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and 
safe journey by land to Paris, and .so to Calais and 
Dover ; oi to go up to Madrid, and so all the way 
by land through Prance. 

In a word, 1 was so preposses.sed against my go- 
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dovei , that 
I resolved to travel all the way by land , which, as I 
was not 111 haste, and did not value the charge, was 
by much the pleasanter wav And to make it moie 
so, my old ca]itain bniught an Englush gentleman, 
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to 
travel with me , after which we picked up two more 
English merehants also, and tw’o young Portugue.se 
gentlemen, the last going to Paris only , so that we 
were in all six of us, and (J\c servants; the two mer- 
chants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves 
w’lth one servant lietween two, to save the charge , 
and as fur me, I got an English sailor to travel with 
me as a servant, besides my mail Friday, who was 
[ 326 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the 
place of a servant on the roan. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our 
company being all very well mounte<l and armed, a e 
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour 
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest 
man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was 
the original of the vv hole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea jour- 
nals, so I shall trouble you now with none of my land 
journal , but some adventures that happened to us 
in this tedious and difficult journey I must not 
omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
strangers to Spam, were willing to stay some time 
to see the court of Spain, and to see w hat was worth 
observing; but it Ixjiiig the latter jiait of the sum- 
mer we hastened away, and set out from Madnd 
about the middle of October , but w hen we came to 
the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several 
towns on the way with an account that so much 
snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains, 
that several travellers were obliged to come back to 
Pampeluna, after having attcmjited, at an extreme 
hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it 
so indeed , and to me, that had been always useil to 
a hot climate, and indeed to countries where we could 
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable ; 
nor indeed was it more painful than it was surpiising 
to come but ten days before out of the Old Castile, 
where the wcathei was not only warm, but very hot, 
and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean 
mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be 
intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perish- 
ing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the 
[S27 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold w eathcr, 
which he had neier seen or felt before in his life. 

To mend the inattei, when we came to Pampeluna 
it continued snow'in{» with so rauc-h violence, and so 
long, that the people said winter was come liefore its 
time ; and the roads, which were diHicult before, were 
now quite impassable, for, in a word, the snow lay 
in some places too thick for us to travel, and being 
not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries, 
there was no going without being in danger of being 
buned alive every step. We stayed no less than 
twenty days at Painiieluna ; when seeing the winter 
coming on, and no likelihood of its lx;nig Ix-ttcr, for 
it was the severest winter all over Europe that had 
heen known in the memory of man, I pi oposeil that 
we should all go away to Eontarabia, and there take 
shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. 

But while we were considering this, theie caiiie in 
four French gentlemen, who having been stopped on 
the French side of the passes, as we were on the 
Spanish, had found out a guide, who. traversing the 
country near the head of Languedoc had brought 
them over the mountains by such ways, that they 
were not much incommoded with the snow, and 
where they met with snow in any quantity, they said 
it was frozen hard cnoug!. to bcai them and then 
horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us he would 
undertake to cairy us the same way with no hazard 
from the snow, provuled we were armed sufficiently 
to protect us from wild beasts, for he said, upon 
these great snows it was frequent for some wolves 
to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, 
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground 
lieing covered with snow We told him we were 
well enough prepared for such creatures as they 
were, if he would ensure us from a kind of two- 
[ 328 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


legged wolves, which, we were told, we were in most 
danger from, especially on the French side of the 
mountains. 

lie .satisfied us there was no danger of that kind 
in the way that we were to go , so we readily agi-eed 
to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, 
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, 
who, as I said, had attempted to go, ana were 
obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly we all set out from Pampcluna, with 
our guide, on the 15th of November ; and, indeed, I 
was surprised when, instead of going forward, he 
came directly back with us on the same road that 
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when 
being passed two rivers, and come into the plain 
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, 
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be 
seen , but on a sudden, turning to his left, he ap- 
proached the mountains another way ; and though 
it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, 
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led 
us by such winding w'ays, that we were insensibly 
passed the height of the mountains without being 
much eiicuinliered with the snow; and all on a 
sudden he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces 
of Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourish- 
ing, though, indeed, it was at a great distance, and 
we had some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found 
it snowed one whole day and a night .so fast, that 
we could not travel , but he bid us be easy, we 
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that 
we began to descend every day, and to come more 
north than before ; and so, depending upon our 
guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night when, our 
guide Ix'ing something before us, and not just in 
[329 3 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
tlieoi a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a 
thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, 
and had he been half a mile before us he had been 
devoured indeed before w'e could have helped him. 
One of them fastened upon his horse, and the other 
attacked the man with that violence, that he had 
not time, or not presence of mind enough, to draw 
his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most 
lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bid 
him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon 
as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed as 
loud as t’ other, “ O master ' O master • ” but, like 
a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and 
with his pistol shut the wolf that attacked him into 
the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my 
man Friday, for he having been used to that kind of 
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but 
went close up to him and shot him, as above , where- 
as any of us would have fired at a fai thcr distance, 
and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endan- 
gered shouting the man. 

But it was enough to have temfied a bolder man 
than I , and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, 
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on 
both Sides the dismallest howling of wolves , and the 
noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it 
was to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude 
of them ; and perhaps indeed theie was not such a 
few as that we nad no cause of apprehensions. 

However, as Fnday hail killed this wolf, the other 
that had fastened ii^xm tiie hoiNe left him immedi- 
ately and fled, having happily fastened upon his 
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in 
his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt 
The man indeed was most hurt, for the raging 
[ 330 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


creature had bit him twice, once on the arm, and 
the other time a little above his knee ; and he was 

J ust as it were tumbling down by the disorder of his 
lorse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It IS easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's 
pistol we all mended our pm‘e, and nd up as fast as 
the way, which was very difficult, would give us 
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we 
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we 
saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday 
had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not 
presently discern what kind of creature it was he 
had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in 
such a surprising manner, as that which followed 
between Friday and the beai', which gave us all, 
though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, 
the greatest diversion ima^nable. As the bear is a 
heavy, clumsy creature, and docs not gallop as the 
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two par- 
ticular qualitie.s, winch generally are the rule of his 
actions- finst, a.s to men, who are not his proper 
prey , I say, not his proper prey, because, though I 
cannot say what excessive hunger might do, which 
was now their case, the ground being all covered 
with snow , but as to men, he does not usually at- 
tempt them, unless they first attack him. On the 
contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you don't 
meddle with him, he won’t meddle with you ; but 
then you must take care to be very civil to him, and 
give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman. 
He won’t go a step out of his way for a prince , 
nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to 
look another way, and keep going on ; for some- 
times if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily 
at him, he takes it for an affront , but if you throw 
or toss anything at him, and it hits him, though it 
[331 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

were but a bit of a stick as big as your finger, he 
takes it for an affront, and sets all bis othoi business 
aside to pursue his revenge , for he will have satis- 
faction ill point of honour That is his first quality ; 
the next is, that if lie lie once affronted, he will 
never leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, 
but follows, at a good round late, till he overtakes 
you. 

My man Friday liail delivered our guide, and 
when we came up to him he was helping him off 
from his horse ; for the man was both hui t and 
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first ; 
when, on the sudden, we spied the beat come out of 
the wood, and a vast monstrous one il was, the 
biggest by far that ever I saw We were all a little 
surprised when we saw bun , but when Friday saw 
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel- 
low’s countenance. “O' O' O'” says Friday, 
three times pointing to him “O master' you give 
me te leave, me shakee te hand with him, me 
make you good laugh.” 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased 
“You fool you,” says I, “lie will c.it \ou up” 
“ Eatee me up ' eateo me up ' ” says Fi ida> , twice 
ovei again , “ me eatee him up , me make you good 
laugh , you all stay here, me snow you good laugh.” 
So down he sits, and gets his bools off in a moment, 
and put on a pair of pumps, as we call the fiat 
shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket, 
gives my other seivaiit his hoise, and with his gun 
away he fiew, swift like the wind. 

T^he bear was walking softly on, and offeied to 
meddle with nobody till Fnday, coming pretty near, 
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him, 
“Hark ye, hark ye,” says Friday, “ me speakee wit 
you.” We followed at a distance; for now being 
come down on the Gasv-oign side of the mountains, 
[ 332 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun- 
try was plain and pretty open, though many trees in 
it scattered here and tliere. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the lieels of tiie bear, 
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great 
stone and thiows at him, and hit him just on the 
head, but did him no more harm than if he had 
thrown it against a wall. But it answered Friday's 
end, for the rogue was so void of fear, that lie did 
it purely to make the liear follow him, and show us 
some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, 
he tuiTis about, and comes after him, taking devilish 
long stride-t, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so 
as would have put a horse to a middling gallop. 
Away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run 
towards us for help , so we all resolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man , though I was 
angry at him heartily for bringing the bear hack upon 
Us, when he was going about his own business another 
way ; and especially I was angry that he had turned 
the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I called 
out, “ You dog,” said I, “ is this your making as 
laugh'' Come away, and take your horse, that we 
may shoot the creature” He hears me, and cries 
out, “ No shoot, no shoot : stand still, you get much 
laugh.” And as the rumble creature run two feet 
for the beast’s one, he tuiiiwl on a sudden, on one 
side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for his 
purpose, he beckoned to us to follow ; and doubling 
his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun 
down upon the ground, at about five or six yards 
from the bottom of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed 
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at 
the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he .scram- 
bles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so 
[ 333 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


monstrously heavy. I wa-s amazed at the folly, as I 
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see 
anytmng to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up 
the tree, we all rode nearer to hjm. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got 
out to the small end of a laige Innb of the trce, and 
the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the 
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree 
was w’eaker, “ Ha ! ” says he to us, “ now you sc‘e 
me teachee the bear dance.” So he falls a-jumping 
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to 
totter, but stood still, and began to look behind 
him, to see how he should get liack. Then, indeed, 
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done 
with him by a great deal When he sees him stand 
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed 
the bear could speak EngRsh, “ What, you no come 
farther ? pray you come farther ,” so he left jumping 
and shaking the tree ; and the bear, just as if he had 
understood what he said, did come a little farther , 
then he fell a-jumping again, and the bear stopped 
again. 

We thought now was a good time to kiiwk him 
on the head, and I called to Fnday to stand still, 
and we would sluxit the bear, but he cued out 
earnestly, “ () pray ' O pray • no shoot, me shoot by 
and then;” he would have said by-and-by. How'- 
ever, to slioi ten the stoi v, Friday danc'ed so much, 
and the bear stood so ticklish, that w'e had laughing 
enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the 
fellow would do , for first wo thought he depended 
upon shaking the bear oft‘; and we found the bear 
was too cunning for that too , for he would not go 
out far enough to be throw n down, but clings fast 
with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could 
not imagine what would be the end of it, and where 
the jest would be at la.st. 

[ 334 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for seeing 
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would 
not be persuaded to come any farther, “ Well, well,” 
says Friday, “ you no come farther, me me go ; 
you no come to me, me go come to you ; ” and upon 
this he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, 
where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets 
himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he 
came near enough to jump down on his feet, and 
away he ran to his gun, tsckes it up, and stands 
still. 

“ Well,” said I to him, “ Fnday, what will you do 
now i* Why don’t you shoot him i* ” “ No shoot,” 
says Friday, “ no yet , me shoot now, me no kill ; me 
stay, give you one more laugh.” And, indeed, so he 
did, as you will see presently , for when the bear sees 
his enemy gone, he comes back from tlie bough where 
he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind 
him every step, and coming backward till he got into 
the body of the tree , tlien with the same hinder end 
foremost he comes down the tree, giasping it with his 
claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. 
At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind 
feet upon the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, 
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot 
him dcml as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not 
laugh , and when he saw we were pleased by our 
looks, lie falls a-langhiiig himself very loud. “ So we 
kill bear in my country,” .says Fnday. “ So you kill 
them ^ ” says I ; “ why, you have no guns.” “ No,” 
says he, “ no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.” 

This was indeed a good diversion to us , but we 
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much 
hurt, and wliat to do we hai-dly knew. The howling 
of wolves ran much in my head ; and indeed, except 
the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of 
[ 335 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


which I have Maid something already, I never heard 
an>^ing that filled me witli so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us 
off, or el<>e, as Friday would have had us, we should 
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous crea- 
ture off, which was worth saving ; but we had three 
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we left 
him, and went forward on our journey. 

The gi-ound was still covei-ed with snow, though 
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains , and 
the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were 
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed 
by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great 
deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised 
the country people, killed a great many of their sheep 
and hoi-scs, and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our 
guide told us if there were any more wolves in the 
country we should find them there , and this was in 
a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, 
and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to 
pass to get through the wood, and then we should 
come to the village w here we were to lodge. 

It was within half-an-hour of sunset when we 
entered the first wood, and a little after sunset when 
we came into the plain. We met with nothing in 
the first wood, except that, in a little plain within the 
wood, which w'as not above two furlongs over, we saw 
five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after 
another, as if they had Ix^eii in chase of some prey, 
and had it in view ; they took no notice of us, and 
were gone and out of our sight in a few moments. 
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched 
faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, 
for he believed there were more wolves a-coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; 
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that 
[ 336 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

wood, which was near half a league, and entered the 
plain. As soon as »e came into the plain, we had 
occasion enough to look about us. The first object 
we met with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor 
horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a 
dozen of them at work , we could not say eating of 
him, but picking of his tiones lather, for they had 
eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their 
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Fri- 
<lay would hav e let fly at them, but I would not suf- 
fer him by any means, foi I found we were like to 
have more business upon our hands than we were 
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain, 
but we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood 
on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after 
we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards 
us, all 111 a bod) , and most of them in a line, as regii- 
laily as an army diawn up by expcricnml officers. I 
scaive knew in what mannet to receive them, but 
found to draw ourselves in » close line was the only 
way , so we formed in a moment , but that we might 
not have twj much intcival, I ordered that only 
ev cry other man should fire, and that the others who 
had not tired should stninl leady to give them a sec- 
ond volley immediatclv, if they continued to advance 
upon us , and th.at then those who had fired at first 
should not pretend to load their fusees again, but 
stand ready with every one a pistol, for we were 
all armed with a fusee and a pan of pistols each 
man , so we wen*, by this method, able to fire six 
volleys, half of us at a time. However, at present 
we had no nec*essity ; for upon firing the first volley 
the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well 
with the noise as with the fire. Four of them being 
shot into the head, dropped ; several othei*s were 
wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could sec by

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the snow. I found they stopped, but did not inime* 
diately retreat ; whereupon, remembering that I had 
been told that the fiercest ci'eatures were terrified at 
the voice of a man, I caused all our company to hal- 
loo as loud as we could ; and I found the notion not 
altogether mistaken, for upon our shout they began 
to retire and turn about. Then I ordered a second 
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to 
the gallop, and away they went to the woods 

This gave us leisure to chaige our pieces again ; 
and that we might lose no time, we kept going. 
But we had but little more than loaded our hisees, 
and put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a 
terrible noise in the .same wood, on our left, only 
that it was farther onward, the same way we were 
to go. 

TTie night was coming on, and the light began to 
be dusky, which made it worse on our side , but the 
noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was 
the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures ; 
and on a sudden, we percfeiveil two or three troops 
of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one 
on our front, so that we seemed to be’ surrounded 
with them. However, as they did not fall noon us, 
we kept our way forward as fast as we could make 
our horses go, which, the wa^ being very rough, was 
only a good large trot, and in this manner we came 
in view of the entrance of a woo<l, through which we 
were to pass, at the farther side of the plain ; but 
we were greatly surprised when, coming nearer the 
lane, or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves 
standing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we 
heard the noise of a gun, and looking that wav, out 
rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, fly- 
ing like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after 
him, full speed ; indeed, the horse had the heels of 
[338 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


chetn ; but as we supposed that he cou]d not hold it 
at that rate, we doubted not but they would mt up 
with him at last, and no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding 
up to the entrance where the horse came out, we 
found the carcass of another horse and of two men, 
devoured by the ravenous creatures ; and one of the 
men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the 
gun, for there lay a gun jast by him fired off ; but 
as to the man, his head and the upper part of his 
body was eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what 
course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, 
for they gathered about us presently in hopes of 
prey, and I venly believe there were three hundred 
of them. It happened very much to our advantage 
that, at the entranc-e into tne wood, but a little way 
from it, there lay some laige timber- trees, which had 
been cut down the summer before, and I suppose 
lay there for carnage. I drew my little troop in 
among those trees, and placing oureelves in a line 
behind one long tree, I advised them all to light, 
and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to 
stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our 
hoi-ses in the centre 

We did so, and it was well we did ; for never was 
a mure furious charge than the creatures made upon 
us in the place. They came on us with a growling 
kind of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber, 
which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were 
only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of 
theirs, it seems, was pnncipally occasioned by their 
seeing our horses behind us, which was the prey they 
aimed at. I ordered our men to fire as before, every 
other man , and they took their aim so sure, that 
indeed they killed seveial of the wolves at the first 
volley , but there was a necessity to keep a continual

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


firing, for they came on like deviN, those behind 
pushing on those before. 

When we had fired our second volk^ of our fusees, 
we thought they stopjied a little, anil 1 hoped they 
would have gone off , but it was but a moment, for 
otheis came foi ward again, so we fi reel two volleys 
of our pistols , and I believe in these four firings we 
had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed 
twice as many, yet they came on ogam 

I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily ; so 1 
calletl my servant, not my man Frida\, for he was 
better employed, for with the greatest dexterity 
imaginable he had <harged my fusee and his own 
while we were engaged; but as I said, I calletl my 
othei man, and giving him a horn of powder, I bade 
him lay a tram all along the piece of timlier, and let 
it be a large tram. He did so, and had but just 
time to get away when the wolves came up to it, and 
some were got up upon it, when I, snapping an un- 
charged pistol close to the powder, set it on fife 
'rhose that were upm the timber were scorched 
with it, and six oi seven of them fell, or rather 
jumped, in among us with the force and fright of 
the fire. We despatche<l these in an instant, and the 
rest were so frighted with the light, which the night, 
for it was now very near dark, made more ternble, 
that they drew back a little , upon which I ordered 
our last pistol to lx> fiml off iii one vollev, and after 
that we ^ve a shout. Upon this the wolves turned 
tail, and we sallied immraiatclv upon near twenty 
lame ones, whom we found struggling on the gi’ound, 
and fell a-cuttnig them with our swoixls, which an- 
swered oui exfiectation ; for the crying and howling 
they made was hettei iindersttKxl by their fellows, so 
that they all fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about thi'eescore of 
them, and had it been daylight we had killed many

more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we 
made forward again, for we had still near a league 
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and 
yell in the woods as we went several times, and 
sometimes we fancied wc saw some of them, but the 
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. So in 
about an hour more we came to the town where we 
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fnght, 
and all in arms , for it seems that the night before 
the wolves and some bears had broke into tlie village 
in the night, and put them in a terrible fright , and 
they were obliged to keep guaid night and day, but 
espiccially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and, 
indeed, their people. 

The next iiioniiiig our guide was so ill, and his 
limbs swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, 
that he <‘oiild go no farlhei , so we weie obliged to 
take a new guide there, and go to Touloust', wheic 
we found a warm climate, a fnnlful, pleasant country, 
and no snow, no wolves, or anytning like them. 
But when we told oiir story at Toulouse, they told 
us it was nothing but what w.is ordinary in thegieat 
forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when 
the snow lay on the ground , but they inquired much 
what kind of a guide wc had gotten that would ven- 
ture to bring us that way in such a severe season, 
and told us it was very much we were not all de- 
voured When we told them how we placed our- 
selves, and the horses m the middle, they blamcsl us 
exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but wi- 
had been all destroyed , for it was the sight of the 
horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their 
prey , and that, at other times, they are really afranl 
of a gun ; but the being excessive hungry, and rag- 
ing on that account, the eagerness to come at the 
horses had made them senseless of danger , ami that 
if wc had not, by the continued fire, and at last by 
[ 3 «] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, 
it had been great odds but that we had been tom to 
pieces ; whereas had we been content to have sat still 
on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not 
have taken the horses for so much their own, when 
men were on their backs, as otherwise ; and withal 
they told us, that at last, if we had stood all to- 
gether, and left our horses, they would have been so 
eager to have devoured them, that we might have 
conic off safe, especially having oui firearms in our 
hands, and being so many in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in 
my life ; for seeing above three hundred devils come 
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having 
nothing to shelter us or retieat to, I gave myself 
over for lost , and as it was, I believe I shall never 
care to cross those mountains again I think I 
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, 
though I were sure to meet with a storm once a 
week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my 
passage through France; nothing but what other 
travellers have given an account of with much more 
advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse 
to Pans, and without any considerable .stay came to 
Calais, and lande<l safe at Dover, the 14th of 
January, after having had a severe cold season to 
travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of iiiy travels, and 
had in a little tune all my new -discovered estate 
safe about me, the bills of exchange which I brought 
with me having been very cuirently paid 

My principal guide and pnvy councillor was my 
g(xxl ancient widow , who, in gratitude for the money 
I had sent her, thought no pains too much, or care 
too great, to employ for me ; and I trusted her so 
entirely w"!!!! everything, that I was perfectly easy 
[ 342 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


as to the security of my effects ; and indeed I was 
very happy from my beginning, and now to the end, 
in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my effects 
with this woman and setting out for Lisbon, and so 
to the Brazils. But now another scruple came in my 
way, and that was religion , for as I had entertained 
some doubts about the Roman religion even while I 
was abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so I knew 
there was no going to the Biazils for me, much less 
going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace 
the Roman Catholic religion without any reserve ; 
unless on the other hand I resolved to be a sacrifice 
to my principles, be a martyi for religion, and die 
in the Inquisition. So I resolved to stay at home, 
and if I could find means for it, to dispose of my 
plantation. 

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, 
who in return gave me notice that he could easily 
dispose of it theie ; but that if I thought fit to give 
him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, 
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, 
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived 
just upon the spot, and whom I knew were very rich, 
so that he believed they would be fond of buying it, 
ho did not doubt but I should make 4000 or 5000 
pieces of eight the more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to offer it 
to them, and he did so , and in about eight months 
more, the ship being then retui ned, he sent me an 
account that they had accepted the offer, and had 
remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent 
of theirs at Li.sbon to pay for it. 

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the 
form which they .sent from Li-sbon, and .sent it to my 
old man, who sent me bills of exchange for 32,800 
pieces of eight to me, for the estate; reserving the 
1343] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


payment of 100 moidores a year to him, the old man, 
during his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his 
son for his life, which I had promised them, which 
the plantation was to make good as a rcnt-chaige. 
And thus I have given the first part of a life of 
fortune and adventure, a life of Ih'ov idencc’s chequer- 
work, and of a variety which the world will seldom 
be alile to show the like of, beginning foolishly, but 
closing much more happily than any part of it ever 
gave me leave so much as to hojie for. 

Any one would think that in this state of compli- 
cated good fortune 1 was past running any more 
hazards , and so indeed I had lieen, if other circum- 
stanres had concuiTcd. But 1 was iniiied to a wan- 
dering life, had no family, not many relations, nor, 
however rich, had I contracted much acijuaintance , 
and though I bad sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I 
could not keep the countiy out of my liearl, and had 
a gieat mind to be upon tlie wing again , esjiecially 
I could not resist the strong inclination I had to see 
my island, and to know if the pool Sfianiards were 
III being theie, and how' the rogues I left there had 
used them 

Mv true fiiend, the widow, earnestly dissuaderl me 
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost 
seven years she pi-evented my lunning abroad, during 
which time I took my two nephews, the children of 
one of my brothers, into my care The eldest has ing 
soinetbing of his own, I bred up ns a gentleman, and 
gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate 
after my decease The othei I put out to a captain 
of a ship, and after fiic ycais, finding him a sensible, 
bold, entei prising young fellow, I put him into a 
good ship, and sent him to sea , and this young 
fellow afterwards drew' me in, as old as I was, to 
farther adventui’es myself. 

In the meantime, I in part settled mvself here , 
[ 344 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

for, first of all, I married, and that not either to mv 
disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three chif- 
(hen, two sons and one daughter; but inv wife dy- 
ing, and iny nephew coming home with good success 
fiom a voyage to Spain, iny inclination to go abroad, 
and his importunity, prevaiUnl, and engaged me to 
go in his ship as a piivatc tiader to the East Indies. 
This was 111 the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited iiiy new colony in the 
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, hod the 
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left 
there ; how at fiist they insulted the poor Spanmids, 
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa- 
rated, and how at last the Spaniards weie obliged 
to use violence with tlicm ; how they weie sul))ected 
to the Spaniards ; how honestly the Spaniauls used 
them ; a hisloiy, if it were entered into, as tull of 
vaiicty and wonderful accidents as my own part, 

C articularly also as to then battles with the Carib- 
eaiis, who landed several times upon the island, 
and as to the improvement they made u|)on the 
island itself, and how five of them made an attempt 
upon the mainland, and brought aw.iy eleven men 
and five women prisoiieis, bv which, at my coining, I 
found about twenty young children on the island. 

Here I stayed about twenty days, left them suji- 
plies of all iiecessaiy things, and particularly of 
amis, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two w oik men, 
which I brought from Engiand with me, vi/, a 
cai[>eiiter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shaied the island into parts with 
theiii, leserved to myself the propeity of the whole, 
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed 
on , and having settled all things with them, and 
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them 
thei e 

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence 
[ 346 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I sent a bark, which 1 bought there, with more 
people, to the island; and in it, besides other sup- 
plies, I sent seven women, being such as I found 
proper for service, or for wives to such as would take 
them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to 
send them some women from England, with a good 
cargo of necessaries, if they would appW themselves 
to planting; which I afterwards performed; and 
the fellows proved very honest and diligent after 
they were mastei'ed, and had their properties set 
api^ for them. I sent them also from tW Brazils 
five cows, three of them being big with calf, some 
sheep, and some hogs, which, when I came again, 
were considerably increased. 

But all these things, with an account how three 
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and 
ruined their pIantation.s, and how they fought with 
that whole number twice, and were at first defeated 
and three of them killed ; but at last a storm de- 
sttoying their enemies’ canoes, they famished or 
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and re- 
covered the possession of their plantation, and still 
lived upon the island ; — all these things, with some 
very surprising incidents in some new adventures of 
my own, for ten years more, I may perhaps give a 
fairer account of hereafter.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 


T he success the former part of this work 
has met with in the world, has yet been 
no other than is ac'knowledged to be due 
to the surprising \arietv of the subject 
and to the agi-eeable manner of the 


performance. 

All the endeavours of envious people to reproach 
it with being a mniance, to search it for errors in 
geography, inconsistency in the relation, and contra- 
dictions 111 the Fact, have proved abortive, and as 
impotent as malicious. 

The just application of every incident, the religious 
and useful inferences diawit fioiii every part, are 
so many testimonies to the good design of making it 
public, and must legitimate all the jiart that may be 
called invention or parable in the stoiy. 

The second part, if the Editor’s opinion may pass, 
is (contrary to the usage of second parts) every way 
as entertaining as the first, conbuns as strange and 
surprising incidents, and as great a variety of them ; 
nor IS the application less .senous and suitable, and 
doubtless will, to the sober as well as ingenious readei, 
be every way as profitable and diverting; and this 
makes the abridging this work as scandalous as it is 
knavish and ridiculous, seeing, while to shortem the 
book that they may seem to reduce the value, they 
stnp it of all those reflcxrtioiis, as well religious as 
moral, which aie not only the greatest beauties of 
the work, but are calculated for the infinite advan- 


tage of the reader.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 

By this they leave the work naked of its brightest 
ornaments ; and if they would at the same time pre- 
tend that the author bas supplied the story out of 
his invention, they take from it the improvement 
which alone rccomnieiids that invention to wise and 
good men. 

The injury these men do the proprietor of this 
work IK a practice all honest men abhor, and he be- 
lieves he may challenge them to show the difference 
lietweeii that and robmng on the highway, or break- 
ing open a house. 

If they can't show any difference in the crime, 
they will find it hard to show' why there should be 
any difference in the iiunishment ; and he will answei 
for it that nothing snail be wanting on his part to 
do them justice.

FARTHER ADVENTURES 

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

T hat homely proverb used on so many 
occasions m England, viz., “ That what 
1*1 bred m the bone will not go out of the 
flesh,” was never inoie verified than in the 
story of my hfe. Any one would think 
that, after thirty -five years’ affliction, and a variety of 
unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever 
went through before, and after near seven years of 
pence and enjoyment in the fulness of all things, grown 
old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have 
had expel lence of everv state of middle life, and to 
know which wa> most adn|)te<l to make a man com- 
jiletely happy , I sa>, after all this, any one would 
have thought that the native pn)|X!iisity to rambling, 
which I gave an acTOunt of in my first .setting out 
into the world to have been so predominant in my 
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be 
fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, 
at sixty-onc years of age, have been a little inclined 
to stay at home, and have done ventunng life and 
fortune any more. 

Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adven- 
tures was taken away in me ; for I had no fortune to 
make, I had nothing to seek. If I had gained ten 
thousand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had 
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave 
it to, and that I had was visibly increasing, for hav- 
ing no great family, I could not spend the income of

what I had unices I would set up for an expensive 
way of liiing, such as a great faiiiih, servants, equi- 
pagc, gaietv, an<l the like, which were things I had no 
notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing 
indeed to do but to sit still and full\ enjo)’ what I 
had got, and sec it increase dailv upon iny hands. 

Yet all these things bad no eft'ect upon me, or at 
least not enough to resist the strong inelinatioii I liad 
to go abroad again, whuh hung alxnit me like a 
chronual distemper, pai-ticulail} the desire of seeing 
my new plantation in the island, and tlie colony I left 
there, laii in my head continualh . I dieanied of it 
all night, and in^ imagination ran Ufion it all da^ , it 
was up|)ermost in all mv thoughts, and m^ fanti 
worked so steadily and strongl} upon it, that I talked 
of it out of my sleep In short, nothing (uiild remove 
it out of iu\ mind, it even bioke so violeiitlv into 
all my discouisies, that it made my t onveisation tiie- 
some, for I could bilk of notliing else . all my dis- 
couise run into it, even to impertinence, and I saw 
it in V self 

I have often heaixl persons of good judgment saj, 
that all the stir people make in the woild about 
gtiosts and appaiitions is owing to the strength of 
imagination, and the {Kiwerfid o[>eiatioii of iancy in 
then minds, that tlieie is no suth thing as a spiiit 
appearing, or a ghost w liking, and the like , that 
people's ]Miniig aflectionately upon the past lonvei-

there is nothing but shadow and vapoui in the thing,

there is anything in the stories they tell iis of that 
kind, more than the produet of vapours, sick minds, 
and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought 
me into such ecstasies of vapours, or what else I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself oftentimes 
upon the spot, at iny old castle behind the trees, 
saw my old Spaniard, Fnday’s father, and the repro- 
liate .sailors I left upon the island ; nay, I fancied I 
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily, 
though I was broad awake, as at persons just before 
me , and this I did till I often frighted myself with 
the images my fancy repw'sented to me. One time 
in my sleep I had tlie villainy of the three pirate 
sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard 
and Friday’s fatlicr, that it was sui prising They 
told me how they barbaiouslv attempted to murder 
all the Spaniaids, anil that they set fire to the pro- 
\isions they had laid up, on pin pose to distress and 
starve them ; tilings that I had nevoi heard of, and 
that indeed were iievoi all of them tiue in fact, but 
it was so waim in my iinagination, and so realised to 
me, that to the hour I saw them I could not be per- 
suaded but that it was or would lie true , also how' 

1 resented it when the Spaniard complained to me, 
and how I brought them to justice, tried them be- 
fore me, and ordei-ed them all three to be hanged. 
What there was really in this, .shall be seen in its 
place ; for however I came to form such things in 
my dream, and what secTct convei’se of spirits in- 
jected it, yet there w'as very much of it true. I say, 

I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and 
specifically tine , but the general part was so true, 
the base villainous behaviour of these three hardened 
rogues was such, and had been so much worse than 
all I can describe, that the dream had too much 
similitude of the fact, and as I would afterwards

havo punished tlieiii severely, so if I had hanged their 
all I hud been inue h in the right, and should have 
been justifiable both by the laws of God and man. 

But to letum to my story In this kind of tem- 
per I had lived some years I had no enjoyment of 
niy life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion 
but what h^ something or other of this m it; 
so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent 
u[)on it, told me very seriously one night that she 
believed there was some secret powerful impulse of 
Providence upon me, which had determined me to go 
thither again , and that she found nothing hindei^ 
mv going, hut iiiv being engaged to a wife and 
children. She told me, that it was true she could 
not think of jiarting with me, but as she was as- 
sured that if she was dead it would be the first thing 
I would do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing 
was detcniiiiied above, she would not be the only 
obstruction , for if I thought fit, and resolved to go 

^"hcre she found me very intent upon her words, 

and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a 
little disoiderwl her, and she stopped. I asked her 
why she did not go on, and say out what she was 
going to say. But I perceived her heart was too 
full, and some tears stood in her eves. “ Speak out, 
my dear," said I, “are vou willing I should go''" 
“ No," says she very affectionately, “ I •am far from 
willing; out if you are resolved to go," says she, 
“and rather than I will lie the only hindrance, I 
will go with you , for though 1 think it a most pre- 
posterous thing for one of your years, and in your 
condition, yet if it must be," said she again, wwp- 
ing, “ I won’t leave you , for if it be of Heaven, you 
must do it. There is no resisting it , and if Heaven 
makes it vour duty to go. He wiD also make it mine 
to go with you, orotheiwise dispose of me, that I may 
not obstruct it."

HOBINSON CRUSOE 


Thiiii affectionate behaviour of my wife’b brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con- 
sider what I was a-doing. I corrected my wander- 
ing fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately 
what business I had, after threescore \ ears, and after 
sucli a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and 
closed in so happy and easy a inanner — I say, what 
business 1 haa to rush into new harards, and put 
myself upon adventures fit only fur youth and 
poverty to run into. 

With those thoughts, 1 considered my new en- 
gagement; that 1 had a wife, one child born, and 
my wife then great with child of another; that I 
had all the woild could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazards for gain , that 1 was declining in 
years, and ought to think rather of leaving w hat I 
had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as 
to what my wife had said, of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, 
I had no notion of that , so after many of these 
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagi- 
nation, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe piniple 
iiia> always do in like coses, if they will , ana, in a 
word, I coiujuei'cd it, composed myself with such 
arguments as occurred to iiiy thought, and which 
my present condition furnished me plentifully with , 
and particularly, as the most effectual method, I 
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to 
engage in some business that might effectually tie 
me up from any more ex< ui-sions of this kind , for 
I found that thing return upon me chiefly when I 
was idle, had nothing to do, nor anything of moment 
immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the 
county of Bedford, and itisolved to remove myself 
thither. I had a little convenient house upon it, 
and the land about it I found was capable of great

improvement, and that it waa many ways suited to 
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, man- 
aging, planting, and improving of land , and par- 
ticularly being an inland country, I was removed 
from conversing among ships, sailors, and things re- 
lating to the remote part of the woild. 

In a word, 1 went down to my farm, settled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
horses, cows, sheep, and setting seriously to work, 
became in one half year a mere country gentleman 
My thoughts were entirely taken up in managing 
my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, plant- 
ing, &c. , and I lived, as I thonght, the most agree- 
able life that nature was capable of directing, or 
that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable 
of lieing retreated tti. 

I tanned upon my own land, I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles. I could pull up 
or cut down as 1 pleased. What I planted was 
for' myself, and what I improved was for my fam- 
ih , and having thus left off the thoughts of wmi- 
dering, I had not the least discomfort in any part 
of life, as to this woild Now I thought indeed that 
I enjoyed the middle state of life that uiv father so 
earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of 
heavenly life, something like wliat is dcsciibed by 
the poet upon the subject of a country life • 

•• Free from vices, free from care, 

Age has no pain, and youth no snare ” 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unfoieseen I’rovideiK-e unhinged me at once, 
and not only made a bi-each upon me, inevitable and 
incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a 
deep rolapse into the wandenng disposition , which, 
as I may say, being bom in my very blood, soon 
lecovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a 
[ 6 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force 
upon me, so that nothing could make anj more 
impression upon me. 'iliis blow was the loss of 
my wife. 

It IS not my business here to wiite an elegy upon 
my wife, give a character of hei particular virtues, 
and make ray court to the sex by the flattery of a 
funeral sermon. She w'a-s, m a few words, the stay 
of all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, 
the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to 
that happy compass I w'as in, from the most extrava- 
gant and ruinous project that fluttered in my head, 
as above, and did more to guide my rambling genius 
than a mother’s teai-s, a fathei’s instructions, a 
ti lead’s counsel, or my own reasoning powers could 
do. I was happy in listening to her teai-s, and in 
being moved b> hei entreaties, and to the last 
degree desolate and dishxated in the world by the 
loss of her. 

When she was gone, the woild looked awkwardly 
lound me. I was as much a stranger in it, in my 
thoughts, as I was in the Biazils when I went first 
on shore there , and as much alone, except as to the 
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I 
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw 
the world busy lourid me, one part labouring for 
bread, and the other part squandering in vile ex- 
cesses 01 empty pleasures csjiially miserable, because 
the end they proposed still flerl from them ; for the 
man of pleasure eveiy day surfeited of his vice, and 
heaped up work for soirow and repentance , and the 
men of labour spent their strength in daily .stiug- 
gliiigs for bread to maintain the vital strength they 
laboured with, so living in a daily circulation *of 
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as 
if daily bread were the July end of wearisome life, and 
a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


This put me in mind of the life I lived in my 
kinjrdom, the island, where I suffeml no mure com 
to grow bectiuse I did not want it, and bred no 
more goats, because I had no more use for them , 
where the money lav in the diawer till it grew 
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked 
upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reason and religion ha<l dictated 
to me, would have taught to me to search farther 
than human enjoyments lor a full felicity, and that 
there was something which certainly was the reason 
and end of life, supenor to all these things, and 
which w'as eithei to be possessed, or at least hoped 
foi, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone, I was like a 
ship without a pilot, that could only mn afore 
the wind. My thoughts ran all away again into 
the. old affair , my head was quite tuiiied with the 
whimsies of foreign adventures : and all the pleasant 
innocent amusements of my farm and iny gaideii, 
my cattle and niy family, which lx.-foic entiiely {k>s- 
sessed me, weie nothing to me, had no relish, and 
were like music to one that has no eai, oi food to 
one that has no taste In a word, I resolved to 
leave off' housekeeping, let my farm, and return 
to London , and in a few months after I did so 

AVhen I came to London, I was still as uneasy as 
I was iK'forc. I had no relixh to the jilace, no em- 
ployment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about 
like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is 
perfectly useless in Gtxl’s iix^tioii, and it is not one 
farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether he 
be dead or alive. This also was the life which of 
all circiinistanccs of life was the most my aversion, 
w ho had been all my days used to an active life ; 
and I would often say to myself, “ A state of idle- 
[ 8 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ne>ih is the ^c^y dregs of life," and indeed I thought 
I was much more suitably employed when I was 
twenty-six da\s a-making me a deal boa id. 

It was now the beginning of tiie year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom, as I had obsen cd before, I had 
brought up to the .sea, and had made him eoiinnander 
of a ship, w'as come home horn a short voyage to 
Bilboa, being the fiist he hod made , and he came to 
me, and told methat some merehants of his acquaint- 
ance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for 
them to the East Indies and to China, as private 
tradere. “And now, untie," says he, “if >on will 
go to sea with me, I ’ll engage to land you upon voiii 
old habitation in the island, for we are to touen at 
the Brazils." 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future 
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than 
the concurrence of second causes with I he ideas of 
things which we form in our minds, perfectly re- 
served, and not comiiiunicatcd to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how fai m^ distemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say, when 
that very moiniiig, iKjfore he came to me, I had, in i 
great deal of confusion of thought, and revol\ iiigeveiy 
part of my ciiiu instances in my mind, come to this 
resolution, viz., that I would go to Lislion, and con- 
sult with my old sea-captain , and so, it it was latioiial 
and practicable, I would go and see the island again, 
and see what was become of my people theie I had 
pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the 
place, and canning iiihahitants from henc-e, getting 
a patent for the possession, and I know not what ; 
when in the middle of all this in comes my nephew, 
as I have said, with his project of carrying me 
thither, in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily 

[93 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


at him, “What devil,” said I, “sent \ou of this 
unlucky errand ? " Mv nephew startled, as if he had 
been frighted at first ; out perceiving I was not much 
displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself 
“I hope it may not bean unlucky pioposal, sir,” says 
he. “ I dare say you would lie pleased to see your 
new colony there, w here you once reigned with more 
felicity than most of your biother inonarchs in the 
world.” 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my 
temper, that is to say, the prepossession 1 was under, 
and of which I have said so much, that I told him, 
in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I 
would go with him ; but I told him I would not 
promise to go any farthei than my own island. 
“Why, sii,” says he, “\ou don’t want to be left 
there again, I hope ? ” “ Why,” said I, “ can you 
not take mo up again in your return ? ” Ho told 
me it could not be possible that the merchants would 
allow him to come that way with a loaded ship of 
such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, 
and might be three or four “ Hesidcs, sir, if I 
should miscarry,” said he, “and not ictiirn at all, 
then you would be just reduced to the condition 
you were in before.” 

This was \erv lational, but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to carry a fiamed sloop on 
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces, and 
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of 
some CAipenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, 
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go 
to sea in a tew days 

I was not long resoKing, foi indeed the impor- 
tunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with 
mv inclination, that nothing could oppose me On 
the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobot^ 
concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


me one way or other, except my ancient good 
friend tlie widow, who earnestly struggled with me 
to consider my yeare, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless haxaras of a long voyage . and above all, 
my young children But it was J1 to no puipost' , 
I had an irresistible desire to the voyage , and I told 
her I thought there was something so uncoinmon in 
the impressions I had upon my mind foi the voyage, 
that it would be a kind of I’esisting IVovidence if I 
should attempt to stay at home , after which she 
ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not 
only m making piovision for my voyage, but also in 
settling my family affairs for mv absence, and provid- 
ing for the education of my children. 

In Older to this I made my will, and settled the 
estate I had in such a mannei for my children, and 
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy 
and satisfied they would have justice done them, 
whatever might befall me , and for their education, 
I left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient 
maintenance to herself for her core ; all which she 
richly deserved, for no mother could have taken 
more care in their education, or undeistood it better , 
and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to 
thank her for it 

My nephew was n-ady to sail about the beginning 
of Januaiy 169-4-95, and I with my man Friday 
went on board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides 
that sloop which I mentioned above, a very consider- 
able cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my 
colony, which if I did not find in good condition, I 
resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I 
purposed to place there os inhabitants, or at least to 
set on work there upon my own account while I 
stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward, as they should appear willing; particularly, 
[ 11 ] 



ROBINSON (’RUSOE 


I carried two caqienteiN, a Minith, and a very handy, 
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, but was 
also a genci.d mechanic, for W was dexteious at 
making wheels, and handniills to grind coin, was 
a good turner, and a good pot-maker. He also made 
anything that was piiiper to make of earth, or of 
woixi, in a woid, we called him our Jack-of-all- 
tradcs. 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered 
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwaids csiiisentetl to stay on our 
new plantation, and pro»ed a most necessary handy 
fellow as could be desired, in many othei businesses 
besides that of his liade , for, as I observed formcily, 
necessity arms us foi all employ inents. 

My cargo, as ncai as I can collec-t, foi I have 
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted of 
a sufficient (juantity of linen, and some thin English 
stuffs foi (lolhing the SjHunards, that I expected to 
find there, aiid enough of them as by my. calculation 
might comfortably supply them for seven yeai-s. If 
I lemembei right, the materials I cained for cloth- 
ing them with, gloves, liats, shoes, stcx-kiiigs, and all 
such things as they could want for wcanng, amounted 
to above two hundred piunds, including some beds, 
bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen 
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, hiass, &c, and 
near an hundred pound more in non work, nails, tmils 
of every kind, stajik's, h(x>ks, hinges, and every 
necessary thing I could think of 

I carried also an huiidml spaie arms, muskets, and 
fusees, besides some {iistols, a considerable quantity 
of shot of all sizes, and two pieces of brass cannon , 
and because 1 knew not what time and what extrem- 
ities I was providing for, I earned an hundred barrels 
of powder, besides swoids, cutlasses, and the iron part 
of some pikes .uid halberds ; so that, in short, we had 
[ 12 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


a lai^ magazine of all sorts of stores ; and I made 
my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more 
than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there 
was occasion, that when we came there, wc might 
build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies. 
And indeed I at first thought there was new! enough 
for it all, and much more, if wc hoped to maintain 
our possession of the island, as shall lie seen in the 
coui’se of that stoiy 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had 
been used to meet with, and therefore shall have the 
less occasion to iiitcirupt the reader, who {lerhaps 
may be impatient to heai how matters went with my 
colony, yet some odd awadents, cross winds, and bad 
weathei happened on this first setting out, which 
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first, 
and I, who had nevei made but one voyage, viz., my 
fii'st voyage to Guinea, in which I iniglit be said to 
come back again as the voyage* was at first designed, 
liegan to think the same ill fate still attended me, 
and that I was born never to lie contented with being 
on shore, and yet to be alwavs unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where 
we lay witidbound two and twenty days, but we had 
this satisfaction with the disastci, that provisions 
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost 
plenty , so that while we lay hen we never touched 
the ship’s stores, liut lathci added to them , also I 
took in several live hogs, and two cows and calves, 
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on 
shore in my island , but we found occasion to dispose 
otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and 
had a very fair gale of wind for some days. As I 
remember, it ini^t be aixmt the 20th of February, 
in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, 
[13] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


came into the round-house, and told us he saw a flash 
of Are, and heard a gun flred ; and while he was tell- 
ing us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain 
heard another. This made us all run out upon the 
quarter-deck, where for a while we heaid nothing, but 
m a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found 
that there was some very terrible fire at a di.stonce. 
Iinmcfliately we had recourse to our reckonings, in 
which we all agreed that there could be no land that 
w'ay in winch the fire showed itself, no, not for five 
hundred leagues, for it appeared at W.N.W. Upon 
this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at 
sea ; and as by our hearing the noise of guns just 
before we concluded it could not be far off, we stood 
directly toward.s it, and were presently satisfied we 
should discover it, because the farther we sailed the 
greater the light appeared, though the weather being 
hazy we could not perceive anything but the light 
for a while. In about half-an-hour’s sailing, the 
wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and 
the weather clearing up a little, we could plainly dis- 
cern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of 
the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, 
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged 
ill it I presently recollected my former circum- 
stances, and in what condition I w-as in when taken 
up by the Portugal captain , and how much more 
deplorable the ciicunistances of the poor crcatures 
belonging to this ship mast be if they had no other 
ship in company with them Upon this I immedi- 
ately ordered that fiic guns should be tired, one soon 
after another, that, if possible, we might give notice 
to them that there was help for them at hand, and 
that they might endeavour to save themselves in their 
boat , for though we could see the flame of the ship, 
yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

[ 14 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


We la^ by some time upon this, only driving os 
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight ; when, 
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had 
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the 
fire was out, that is to say, t!ie rest of the ship sunk.. 
This was terrible, and indeerl an affiictiiig sight, for 
the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must 
be either all destroyed in the ship, or be m the ut- 
most distress in their boat in the middle of the 
ocean, which, at pi'csent, by reason it was dark, I 
could not see. However, to direct them as well as 
I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all the 

f iarts of the ship where we could, and which uc had 
anthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long, letting them know by this that theie was a 
ship not far off 

About eisiht o’clock in the morning w'c discovered 
the ship’s boats by the help of our persjiectiie glasses, 
and found there were two of Ihem, both tlirongisl 
with peo[il<>, and deep in the water We peiceived 
they rowed, the wind Ixung against them, that they 
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see 
them. 

We immediately spread our ancient to let them 
know we saw them, and hung a waft out as a signal 
for them to come on board, and then made more 
sail, standing diiectly to them In little mciie than 
lialf-an-hour we came uji with tliem, and in a woid 
took them all in, being no less than sixty-foui men, 
women, and children ; for there were a great many 
passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mei- 
(haiit ship of three hundred tons, hoineu'ard bound 
from Quebec, ni the inei of Canada. The master 
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, 
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of the steersman ; but on his crying out for help 
was, as everybody thought, entirely put out, when 
they found that some sparks of the first fire had 
gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come 
at, that they could not eflFectuiilly tjuench it ; till 
getting in between the timbers, and within the ceil- 
ing of the ship, it piweeded into the hold, and 
mastered all the skill and all the application they 
were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into 
their boats, which, to their great comfort, weie 
pretty large , being their longboat, and a great 
shallop, besides a small skiff, winch w as of no great 
service to them other than to get some liesh water 
and provisions into her, after they had secured their 
lives fioin the fire. Tliey had indeed small hope of 
their lives by getting into these boats at that dis- 
tance fiom any land, only, as the^ said well, that 
they were escaped fioin the fire, and had a possi- 
bility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and 
might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a 
com^iass, and were prepaiing to make the best of 
their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing 
prettj fair ; for it blew lui ea.sy gale at S.E by E. 
They had as much provisions and water as, w'lth 
sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might 
suppoit them about twelve days, in whii-h, if they 
haid no liaxl wcathei, and no contrary winds, the 
captain said he hoped he might get the banks of 
Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish to 
sustain them till tliey might go on shore. But 
there were so many chances against them in all 
these cases, siiih as storms to overset and founder 
them, rains and cold to benumb and perish their 
limbs, contrary w inds to keep them out and starve 
them, that it must have been next to miraculous 
if they had escaped. 


[ 16 ] 



BOBINSON CRUSOE 


In the midst of their conmltations, every one 
being hopeless and ready to despair, the captain, 
with tears in his eyes, tola me they were on n sudden 
surprised with the joy of lieaniig a gun fired, and 
after that four more , these weie the five guns which 
I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This 
revived their hearts, and gave them the notice which, 
as above, I desired it should, viz., that there was a 
ship at hand for their help 

It was upon hearing these guns that they took 
down their masts and sails , the sound coming fiom 
the windward, they re.solvcd to lie by till morning. 
Sonic time after this, heanng no more guns, they 
fired three muskets, one a considerate while after 
another ; but these, the wind being contrary, we 
never heaid. 

Some time after that again they were still more 
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights and heal- 
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be 
fired all the rest of the night. This set them to 
work with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at 
least that we might the sooiiei come up with them ; 
and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found 
we saw them. 

It IS impossible for me to express the several 
gesturei, the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, 
which these poor dcliveixxl {leople ran into to ex- 

f iress the joy of their souls at so unexpected a de- 
iverance Grief and fear aie easily described ; sighs, 
tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head 
and hands make up the sum of its variety ; but an 
excess of joy, a surpi ise of joy, has a thousand ex- 
ti’avagancies in it. There were some in teal’s, some 
raging and tearing them.selves, as if they had been 
in the greatest agonies of sorrow , some stai k rav- 
ing and downright lunatic, some ran about the 
ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

hands ; some were dancing, some singing, some laugh- 
ing, moic cr>ing; many quite dumb, not able to 
speak a word ; others sick and vomiting, several 
swooning, and ready to faint , and a few were cross- 
ing themsches and gi'ing God thanks 

I would not wioiig them neithei. There might 
be many that were thankhil afterward, but the 
passion was too strong for them at first, and they 
were not able to master it, they were thrown into 
ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a 
veiy few that were composed and serious in their 
joy. 

Perhaps the case may have some addition to it 
from tile particular circumstance of that nation they 
belonged to , I mean the French, w'hose temper is 
allowed to lie more volatile, more passionate, and 
more spi ightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in 
othei nations. I am not philosopher enough to 
delerniine the cause, but nothing I had ever seen 
licfoie came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, 
my trusty savage, was in when he found his father 
in the boat came the nearest to it , and the .sui’prisc 
of the mastei and his two companions, whom I de- 
liveied fioni the villains that set them on shore in 
the Island, came a little way towards it , but noth- 
ing was to compare to this, eithei that I saw in 
Fridav, or anywheie else in my life. 

It is fill ther observable that these extravagancies 
did not show themselves in that different manner I 
have mentioned in different persons only, but all the 
vai’iety would apjicar in a short succession of mo- 
ments in one and the same person. A man that we 
saw this miiuite dumb, and, as it were, stupid and 
confounded, should the next minute be dancing and 
hallcKiiiig like an antic, and the next moment be 
tearing Ins hair, oi pulling his clothes to pieces, and 
stamping them under his feet like a madman , and a

few moments after that we should have him all in 
tears, then sick, then swooning, ainl had not iiimiedi- 
ate help been had would, ii) a few moments more, 
have been dead And thus it was, not with one or 
two, or ten oi' twenty, but with the greatest part of 
them; and, if I remember light, our surgeon w'as 
obliged to let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two piiests among them, one an old 
man, and the other a young man , and that which w'as 
strangest was, that the ohhst man was the worst. As 
soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw 
himself safe, he diopped down stone dead, not the 
least sign of life could be perceived in him Our 
surgeon immediatelv appliwl pioper remedies to le- 
cover him, and was the only man in the ship that 
believed he was not dead At length he opened a 
vein 111 his arm, having first chafed and lublied the 
part, so as to waim it as much as possible Upon 
this the blood, which only diopped at liist, flowed 
soiiiothiiig fieely In three inmates after tlie man 
opened his e)cs . and about a cjnaitei of an hom 
after that he spoke, grew' better, and, in a little time, 
quite well After the hlooil was stop|)ed he walked 
about, and told us lie was fieifectly well, took a dram 
of cot dial which the suigeoii gave him, and was what 
we called, eoine to himself About a ijnaitei of an 
houi after they came i milling into the eahin to the 
surgeon, who was bleeding a Freiah woman that had 
fainted, and told him the piiest was gone stark mad 
It seems he had begun to icvolve the changi' of his 
eireuinstanee, and again this put him into an ecstasy 
of joy , his spirits whirled aimut faster than the ves- 
sels could convey them , the blood giew hot and 
feveiish, .and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any 
cie.ature that evei was in it. The surgeon would not 
bli*ed him again in that condition, but gave him 
something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after

some time, operated upon him, and he waked the 
next morning perfectly composed and well. 

'ITie younger pnest behaved with gieat command 
of his pas.sions, and was really an example of a 
serious, well-governed mind. At his fii-st coming 
on boaid the .ship he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfiilnc-ss for his deliver- 
ance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably dis- 
turbed him, really thinking he had Ix-en in a swoon , 
hut he spake calmly, thanked me, told me he was 
giving God thanks for his deliverance, and begged 
me to leave him a few inoments, and that next to his 
Maker he would give me thanks also 

I was heartily sorry that I distuibed him, and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
also. He continued in that posture about three 
minutes, or a little more, after I left him, then came 
to me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal 
of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, 
thanked me that had, under God, given him and so 
many miserable creatures their lives. I told him I 
had no room to move him to thank God for it rather 
than me , hut I added, that it was nothing but what 
reason and humanity dictated to all men, and that 
we had as much reason ns he to give thanks to God, 
who had blessed us so far as to make ns the instru- 
ments of His mercy to so many of His creatures. 

After this the young piicst appliwl himself to his 
country-folks ; laboured to compose them ; peixuadcd, 
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his 
utmost to keep them within the exi'mse of their 
reason , and with some he had success, though othei-s 
were, for a tune, out of all government of them- 
selves

extravagancies of their pasRionR ; for if an excess of 
joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the 
reach of their reason, what will not the extrava- 
gancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind cany us 
to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an 
exceeding watch over our passions of every Kind, as 
well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sorrow 
and anger. 

We were something disordered by these extrava- 
gancies among our new guests for the first day ; 
but when they had been retired, lodgings provided 
for them as well as our .ship would allow, and they 
had slept heartily, as most of them did, they were 
quite another sort of people the next day 

Nothing of good niaiineiN, or civil acknowledg- 
ments for the kindness shown them, was wanting. 
The French, ’tis known, are naturally apt to exceed 
that way. Tlie captain and one of the priests came 
to me the next day , and desiring to speak with me 
and my nephew, the commander, began to consult 
with Us what should be done with them; and first 
they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all 
they had was little enough for a return to us for 
that kindness received. The captain said they had 
saved some money and some things of value in their 
boats, catthed hastily up out of the flames ; and if 
we would accept it, they were ordered to make an 
offer of it all to us , they only desired to be set on 
shore somewhere in oui way, where, if possible, they 
might get passage to France. 

Mv nephew was for accepting their money at first 
word, and to consider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I overruled him in that jiart, for I knew 
what it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; 
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea 
had served me so, and took all I had for my deliver- 
ance, I must have starved, or have been as much a

slave at the Brazils as I had been in Barbary, the 
mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted, and 
perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better master 
than a Tuik, if not, in some cases, a much woi-se. 

I thei-cforc told the French captain tliat we had 
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but 
that it was our dut}' to do so, as we were fellow - 
creatures, and as we would desiie to be so delivered, 
if we weie in tlie like or any other extremity, that 
we had done nothing for them but what we believed 
they would have done for us, if we had been in their 
case and they in oui’s ; but that we took them up to 
save them, not to plunder them , and it would be a 
most harbaious thing to take that little from them 
which they saved out of the fire, and then set them 
on shore and leave them , that this would be first to 
save them fiom death, and then to kill them our- 
selves; save them from drowning and abandon them 
to-starving, and therofore I would not let the least 
thing be taken fiom them. As to setting them on 
shore, I told them indceil that was an exceeding 
difficulty to us, foi that the ship was hound to the 
Eiust Indies ; and though we were driven out of our 
course to the westward a very great way, and per- 
haps were directed by Htaven on purpose for their 
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to 
change our voyage on this jiartn-ular acxxiunt , nor 
could niy nephew, the captain, answer it to the 
freighteis, with whom he wa.s under charter-party to 

f ui'sue his voyage by the way of Brazil ; and all 
knew we could do for them was, to put ourselves 
in the wav of meeting with other ships homewaid- 
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage, 
if poasible, to England or France. 

The fii-st part of the proposal was so generous and 
kind, they could not but lie very thankful for it; but 
they were in a very great consternation, especially the

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


passengers, at the notion of being earned away to the 
East Indies , and they then entreated me that, seeing 
I was diiven so far to the westward befoic I met with 
them, I would at least keep on the same course to 
the banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I 
might meet with some ship or sloop that they might 
hire to carry them back to Canada, fi-om whence 
they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable retpiest on 
their part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it , 
for indeed I considered that to curry this w hole com- 
jiaiiy to the East Indies would not only be an intol- 
erable seventy upon the poot ]>eople, but would be 
mining our wliole voyage bv devounng all our pro- 
visions ; so I thought it no bieach of charter-party, 
but w'hat an unforeseen accident made absolutely 
necMihsaiy to us, and in w'hicli no one could say we 
were to blame foi the laws of God and .Nature 
would have fbi hid that we should refuse to take up 
two boats full of people in such a distressed condi- 
tion , and the nature of the Hung, as w'ell resjx!eting 
ourselves as tlic poor people, obliged us to set them 
on shore somewhere or othoi for their deliver- 
ance. So I consented that we should carry them ti' 
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would [icnnit , 
and, if not, that I would carry them to Martimco, 
in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh eastei ly, but the w'cather 
pretty good ; and as the winds had continued in the 
jioints betwixm N E and S E. a long time, we missed 
several opjKjrtumties of sending them to Eranc-c ; foi 
we met several ships Ixiund to Europe, wheicof two 
were Kn'iich, from St. ('hnstopher’s ; but they had 
been so long beating up against the wind, that they 
durst take in no passeiigeisi for feai of wanting pro- 
visions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for 
those they should take in, so we were obliged to go 
[ 23 ] 



ROblNSON CRUSOE 


on. It was about a week after this that we made the 
banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my stoiy, 
we put all our French |ieople on boaid a bark, which 
they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and 
cdterwards to carry them to France, if they could get 
provisions to victual themselves with. When I say 
all the French went on shore, I should remember 
that the young priest I spoke of, heanng we were 
bound to the ]^t Indies, desired to go the voyage 
with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Cor- 
omandel, which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully 
liked the man, and h^ very good reason, as will 
appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered 
themselves on our ship, and proved very useful 
fellows. 

Prom hence we directed our course to the West 
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for alxmt 
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind 
at all, when we met with another subject for our 
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that 
before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., 
and the 19th day of March 1694-95, when we espied 
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon per- 
ceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to 
us ; but could not at first know what to make of her 
till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had 
lost her maintopniast, foremast, and buw.spcit , and 
presently she firM a gun ns a signal of distress. The 
weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh 
gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from 
Barbadoes, but had lieen blown out of the road at 
Bnrbadocs, a few day s before she was ready to sail, 
by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore , so that besides the 
terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent 
[ 24 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ca^ for good artists to bring the ship home. They 
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met 
with another terrible storm after the hurricane was 
over, which had blown them quite out of their knowl- 
edge to the westward, and in which they lost their 
masts, as above. They told us they expected to 
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven 
away again to the south-eai»t by a strong gale of 
wind at N N.W., the same that blew now, and hav- 
ing no sails to woik the.ship with hut a main-course, 
and a kind of square sail upon a jui y-foremast, which 
they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, 
but were endeavouring to .stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they 
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides the 
fatigues they had undeigone. Their bread and flesh 
was quite gone, they had not one ounce left in the 
ship, and had had none for eleven days. The only 
relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and 
they had about half a barrel of flour left , they had 
sugar enough ; some succades or sweetmeats they had 
at first, but they were devoured ; and they had seven 
casks of lum. 

There was a youth and his mother and a maid- 
servant on board, who were going passengers, and 
thinking the ship was ready to .sail unhappily came on 
board the evening before the hurricane began ; and 
having no provisions of their own left, they were in a 
more deplorable condition than the i-est ; lor the .sea- 
men, being reduced to such an extreme necessity 
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for 
the poor passenge«> ; and they were indeed in a con- 
dition that theii misery is very hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity 
had not led me, the weather being fan, and the wind 
abated, to go on board the ship. The second mate, 
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been 
[ 25 ] 



ROBINSON CRITSOE 


on board our ship ; and he told me indeed, they had 
thi'ee passengers in the great cabin, that were in a de- 
plorable condition. “ Nay,” says he, “I believe they 
are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above 
two days, and I was afraid to inquire after them,” 
said he, “ for I had nothing to relieve them with.” 

We immediatelv applied oui-selves to give them 
what relief we could spare, and indeed I had so far 
overruled things with my nephew, that I would 
ha\e Mctualled them, though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or anv part of the coast of America, to 
have supplied ourselves, but there was no necessity 
for that. 

But now' they were in a new danger, foi they were 
afr.nd of eating too much, even of that little we gave 
them. The mate, or commander, brought six men 
w ith him 111 his boat, but these poor w retches looked 
like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly 
sit to Iheii oars. The mate himself was very ill, and 
half starved, for he declared he had leseiwed nothing 
from the men, and went share and shaie alike with 
them III every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat 
before him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he liegan to be sick, and out of 
order , so he stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed 
him up something with sonic broth, which he said 
would be to him both food and ph>sic , and aftei he 
had taken it, he grew better. In the meantime, I for- 
got not the men I ordered victuals to be given them, 
and the poor creatures rather devoured than eat it , 
they were so exceeding hungiy, that they were in a 
kind ravenous, and had no coiiinmiul of themselves, 
and two of them cat with so much greediness, that 
they were in danger of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people’s distress was very mov- 
ing to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible 
[ 26 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


prospect of at my first coming on shore in the island, 
where I had neither the least mouthful of food, or 
any prospect of precnring any, besides the hourly 
apprehension I had of being made the food of other 
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship’s 
company, I could not put out of my thought the 
story he had told me of the three poor creatures in 
the great cabin, mz , the mother, her son, and the 
inaid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two 
oi three days, and whom he seemed to confess they 
had wholly iieglectetl, their own extremities being 
so gicat, by which I understood, that they had 
leally given them no food at all, and that there- 
fore they must be perished, and be all lying dead 
perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then 
called captain, on board with his men, to refresh 
them, so I also foigot not the starving crew that 
were left on boaid, but oidered niy own boat to go 
on board the ship, and with my mate and twelve 
men to cany them a sack of biead, and four oi five 
pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon chaiged the 
men to cause the meat to be boiled while they 


stayed, and to keep giiaid in the cook-room, to pre- 
vent the men taking it to eat i avv, or taking it out 
of the pot before it was well boded, and then to 
give every man but a veiy little at a time, and 
by this caution he preseivcd the men, who would 
otherwise have killed themselves with that veij food 
that was given them on purpose to save then lives 
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cahiii, and see what condition the pool 
pa.ssengcrs were in, and if they were alive to com- 
fort them, and give them what refieshment was 
pioper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher 
with some of the prepared broth which he had given 

[ 27 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the mate that was on board, and which he did not 
question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this , but, as I said above, 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, 
which I knew the ship itself would present me with, 
in a more lively manner than I could have it by re- 
port, I took the captain of the ship, as we now 
called him, with me, and went myself a little after 
in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a 
tumult to get the victuals out of the boiler before it 
was ready ; but my mate observed his order, and 
kept a good guard at the cook-room door , and the 
man he placed there, aftei using all poasible jier- 
stiasion to have patience, kept them off by force 
However, he caused .some biscint-cakes to be dipped 
in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, 
which they called brews, and gave them every one 
one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for 
their own safety that he was obliged to give them 
but a little at a time. But it was all in vain , and 
had I not come on board, and their own commander 
and officers with me, and with good words, and some 
threats also of giving them no more, I believe they 
would have broke into the cook-room Iw force, and 
tore the meat out of the furnace , for words are indeed 
of very small force to a hiiiigi'y belly. However, we 
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously 
for the fiiTst time, and the next time gave them 
more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did 
well enough 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the 
cabin was of another nature, and far beyond the 
rest ; for as first the ship’s company had so little for 
themselves, it was but too true that they had at first 
kept them very low, and at la.st totally neglected 
them ; so that for six or seven days, it might be

said, they had really had no food at all, and for 
several (Jays before very little. The poor mother, 
who, as the men reported, was a woman of good 
sen«e and good breraing, had spared all she could 
get so affectionately for her son, that at last she 
entirely sunk under it ; and when the mate of our 
ship went in, she sat upon the fl(X)r or deck, with her 
back up against the sides between two chairs, which 
were la.shed fast, and her head sunk in between her 
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. 
My mate said all he could to revive and encourage 
her, and with a spoon put some broth into her 
mouth. She ojiened her lips, and lifted up one hand, 
but could not speak , yet she understood what he 
said, and made signs to him, intimating that it was 
too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she 
would have said they should take care of him. 

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth 
into her mouth , and, as he said, got two or three 
spoonfuls down, though I (juestion whether be could 
be sure of it or not ; but it was t(X) late, and she died 
the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his 
most affectionate mother s life, was not so far gone , 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with 
bardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an 
old glove III his mouth, having eaten up the rest of 
it. However, being young, and having more strength 
than his mother, the mate got,. something down his 
throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by 
giving him some time after but two or three spexm- 
fuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it 
up again 

But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all 
along upon the deck haid by her mistress, and just 
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 

[ 29 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted, one of 
her bands was clasped round the frame of a chair, 
and she gripped it so hard, tliat we could not easily 
make her let go. Her other arm lay over her head, 
and lier feet lay both together, set fast against the 
frame of the cabin-table. In .short, she lay just like 
one in the last agoiiie.s of death; and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, 
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the 
men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her 
mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days 
before, and whom she loved most tendeily. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl , for 
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great 
know'ledge and experience, had with great application 
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hand as 
to her senses, for she was little less than distracted 
for a considerable time after, as shall appear pre.sently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must lie 
desiied to consider that visits at sea are not like a 
journey into the country, where sometimes people 
stay a week or a fortnight at a place Our business 
was to relieve this distressed ship’s crew, but not to 
he by foi them ; and though they w'eie willing to 
steer the .same coui’se with us for some days, yet we 
could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had

to help him to set up a inain-tupniast, and a kind of 
a topmast to his jury -foremast, we did, as it were, 
lie by him for three oi four days, and then having 
given him five barrels of beefj and a barrel of pork, 
two hogsheads of biscuit, and a jiroportion of peas, 
flour, and what other things we could .spare, and 
taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some 
pieces of eight of them for satisfaction, we left them,

quest, the priest, the youth, and the maid, and all 
their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, 
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth , 
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as 
it seems, had lost his father but a few months before 
at Barbadoes. lie begged of the surgeon to speak 
to me to take him out of the ship ; for, he said, the 
cruel fellows had murdered his mother , and indeed 
so they had, that is to say, passively , for they might 
have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless 
widow, that might have preserved her life, though it 
had been but just to keep liei alive But hunger 
knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no right, 
and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no 
compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we weie going, and 
how it would carry him away from all his fiieiids, 
and put him [lerhaps in ns bad circumstances, almost, 
as those we found him in ; that is to say, starving in 
the world, lie said he mattered not whither be 
went, if he was but (felivered from the terrible crew 
he was among; that the captain (by which he meant 
me, for he could know nothing of nij nephew) had 
saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him , 
and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to her- 
self, she would be scry thankful for it, let us carry 
them where we would. The surgeon represented the 
case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we 
took them both on board, witli all their goods, ex- 
cept eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be 
removed, or come at , and as the youth had a bill 
of lading for them, I made his commander sign a 
writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came 
to Bristol, to one Mi Rogera, a nierchant there, to 
whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver 
a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he

had belonging to the deceased widow ; which I sup- 
pose was not done ; for I could never learn that the 
ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, 
lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and so 
far from any land, that 1 am of opinion the first 
storm she met with aftei'wards she might founder in 
the sea ; for she was leaky, and had damage in her 
hold when we met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, 
and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to 
weather, though at first the winds had been contrary. 
I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of 
wind, weather, cui rents, &c., on the rest of our 
voyage ; but shortening my story for the sake of what 
is to follow, shall observe that I came to my old 
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April 1695. 
It was with no small difficulty that I found the 
place , for as I came to it, and went from it before, 
on the south and east side of the island, as coming 
from the Brazils , so now, coming in between the 
main and the i.sland, and ha%iiig no chart for the 
coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when I 
saw it, or know whether I saw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on 
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oro- 
nooque, but none for my purpose , only this I learned 
by my coasting the shore, that I was under one 
great mistake before, viz., that the continent which 
I thought I .saw from the island I lived in was really 
no continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of 
islands, reaching from one to the other side of the 
extended mouth of that great liver , and that the 
savages who came to my island were not properly 
those which w'e called Caribbee.s, but nslandcrs, and 
other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited 
something nearer to our side than tbe rest. 

In short, I visited .several of these islands to no 
[82] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


purpose; some I found were inhabited, and some 
were not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, 
and thought they had lived there ; but speaking 
with them, I found they had a sloop lay in a sinall 
creek hard by, and they came thither to make salt, 
and to catch some pearl-mussels, if they could , but 
that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, whifh 
lay farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 11 
degrees. 

But at last coasting from one island to another, 
sometimes with the ship, sometimes with the French- 
man's shallop, which we had found aconieiiient boat, 
and therefore kept her with their veiy good will, at 
length I came fair on the south side of my island, and 
I presently knew the very countenance of the place’; 
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside 
with the little creek where was my old habitation. 

As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, 
and asked him if he knew where he was ? He looked 
about a little, and presently clapping his hands cried, 
“ O yes, O there, O yes, O there ' ” pointing to our 
old habitation, and fell a-dancing and capering like 
a mad fellow , and I had much ado to keep him from 
jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 

“ Well, Friday,” says I, “ do you think we shall 
find anybody here, or no ? And what do you think 
shall we see your father ” The fellow stood mute 
as a stock a good while ; but m hen I named his father, 
the poor affectionate creatine looked dejected, and I 
could sec the tears run down his face very plentifully. 
“ What is the matter, Friday ? ” says I ; “ are you 
troubled because you may see your father ” “ No, 
no,” says he, shaking his head, “ no see him more, no 
ever more see again.” “ Why so,” said I, “ Friday 
how do you know that S’ ” — - “ O no, () no,” says 
Friday, “he Ipng ago die; long ago, he much old 
man.” “ Well, well,” said I, “ Friday, you don’t

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


know ; but shall we see any one else then ? " The 
fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points 

i ’ust to the hill above my old house ; and though we 
ay half a league off, he cries out, “ Wo see ' we see ' 
yes, we see much men there, and there, and there.” 
I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not with a per- 
spective glass ; which was, I suppose, because I could 
not hit the place ; for the fellow was right, as I found 
upon inquiry the next day, and there was five or six 
men altogether stood to look at the ship, not knowing 
what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I 
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired 
thi'ee guns, to give them notice we were friends , and 
in about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceixed 
a smoke rise from the side of the creek. So I iiii- 
mediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with 
me ; and hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I 
went directly on shore, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
storv of my living there, and the manner of it, and 
e\ er) particular both of myself and those I left there, 
and who w'as on that account extremely desirous to 
go with me. We had besides about sixteen men 
very well armed, if we had found any new guests 
there which we did not know of, but we had no need 
of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near 
high-water, we rewed directly into the creek . and 
the first man I fixed my eyes upon was the Spaniaid 
whose life I had saveil, and whom I knew by his face 
perfectly well , as to his habit, I shall describe it 
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at 
first but myself ; but there was no keeping Friday in 
the boat ; for tlie affectionate creature had spied his 
father at a distance, a good w'av off’ of the Spaniards, 
where indeed I saw nothing of him ; and if they had 
[ 34 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


not let him go on shore, he would have jumped into 
the sea. He wa.s no sooner on shore, but he flew 
away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It 
would have made any man have shed tears, in spite 
of the firmest resolution, to have seen the fiisit trans- 
ports of this poor fellow’s joy when he came to his 
father; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked 
his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon 
a tree, and lay down by him , then stood and looked 
at him as any one would look at a strange picture, 
for a quarter of an hour together , then lie down on 
the ground, and stroke his legs, and kiss them, and 
then get up again, and stare at him , one would have 
thought the fellow bewitched ; but it would have 
made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion 
run out another wav. In the morning he walked 
along the shore, to and ogam, with his father, several 
hours, always loading him by the hand as if he had 
iK'eii a l.uiy , and c\ cry now and then he would come 
to fetch something or other for him to the boat, 
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a bi.scuit-take, or 
something or other that was good. In the afternoon 
Ills frolics ran another way ; for then he would set 
the old man down upon the ground, and dance about 
him, and make a thousand antic postui'cs and ges- 
tures , and all the while lie did tliis he would lie 
talking to him, and telling him one story or another 
of his travels, and of what had happened to him 
abroad, to divert liim. In short, if the same filial 
affection was to be found in Christians to then 
parents in our part of the world, one would be 
tempteil to say tliere would hardly have been any 
need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression , I return to my landing 
It would be endless to take notice of all the cere- 
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me 
with. The first Spaniaixl, whom, as I said, I knew 
[ 36 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


veiy well, was he wliose life I had saved. He came 
towards the boat, attended by one more, caiTying a 
flag of truce also , and he did not only not know me at 
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being 
me that was come till I spoke to him. “ Seignior,” 
said I, in Portuguese, “do jou not know me?” 
At which he spoke not a woid , but giving his 
musket to the man that was with him, threw his 
arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that 
I did not perfectly hear, comes forward, and embraced 
me, telling me he was inexcusable not to know that 
face again that he had once seen, as of an angel from 
heaven sent to save his life. He said abundance of 
very handsome things, as a well-bied Spaniard always 
knows how , and then beckoning to the person that 
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. 
He then asked me if I would walk to ni} old habita- 
tion, where he would give me possession of my own 
house again, and where I should see there had been 
but mean improvements, so I walked along with him. 
Rut alas ! I could no more find tlie place again than 
if I had never been there , for they had planted so 
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so 
thick and close to one another, and in ten years’ time 
they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was 
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways 
as they themselves only who made them could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifi- 
cations ? He told me I would say there was need 
enough of it when they had given me an account how 
they had passed their time since their arriving in the 
island, especially after they had the misfortune to find 
that I was gone. He told me he could not but have 
some satisfaction in mj good fortune when he heard 
that I was gone away in a good ship, and to my satis- 
faction ; and that he had oftentimes a strong persua- 
sion that one time or other he should see me again ; 
[ 36 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


but nothing that ever befell him in his life, he said, 
was so surpHsing and afflicting to him at first, as the 
disappointment he was under when he came back to 
the island, and found I was not there. 

As to the thi'ee barbarians (so he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long 
story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves 
much better among the savages, only that their num- 
ber was so small. “ And,” says he, “ had they been 
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purga- 
tory and with that he crossed himself on the breast. 
“ But, sir,” says he, “ I hope you will not be displeased 
when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we 
were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm 
them, and make them our subjects, who would not 
be content with being moderately our masters, but 
would be our muiderers.” I answered, I was heartily 
afraid of it when I left them there , and nothing 
troubled me at my {larting from the island but that 
they were not come bock, that I might have put them 
in possession of everything first, and left tW other 
in a state of subjection, as they deserved , but if they 
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should 
be very far from finding any fault with it , for I knew 
they were a pareel of lefractoiy, ungovemed villains, 
and were fit for any manner of mischief. 

While I was saying this, came the man whom he 
hod sent back, and with him eleven men more. In 
the distress they were in, it was impossible to guess 
what nation they were of; but he made all clear 
both to them and to me. First he turned to me, 
and pointing to them said, “ These, sir, are some of 
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; ” and 
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let 
them know who I was ; upon which they tdl came 
up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and 
oranary fellows, and 1 the like, but really as if they 
[ 37 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


hod been ambassadors of noblemen, and I a monarch 
or a great conqueror. Their behaviour was to the 
last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed 
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well be- 
came them , and, in short, they had so much more 
mannei'j than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their 
civilities, much less how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, 
the island after my going away is so very remark- 
able, and has so many incidents which the former 
part of my relation will help to understand, and 
which will, in most of the particulais, refer to that 
account I have already given, that I cannot but 
commit them with great delight to the reading of 
those that come after me 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation 
in the first person, which will put me to the expense 
of ten thousand .said I 's, and said he's, and he told 
me's, and I told hiin's, 4ind the like, hut I shall 
collett the facts histoncally as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my conveiMiig 
with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I must go back to the circumstance in 
which I left the island, and in which the persons 
were of whom I am to speak. And first it is neces- 
sary to repeat, that I had sent away Fnday’s father 
and the Spaniaid, the two whose lives I hM rescued 
from the savages ; I say, I had sent them away in a 
large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to 
fetch ovei the Spanianl’s companions whom he had 
left behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in order to suc- 
cour them for the present, and that, if possible, we 
might together find some way for our deliverance 
afterward. 

[S8] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When I sent them awa}', I had no visible appeal 
ance of, or the least room to liope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before, 
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after- 
wards happened, I mean of an English ship coming 
on shore there to fetc'h me off ; and it could not but 
be a very great surprise to them when they came 
buck, not only to find that I was gone, but to find 
three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that 
I had left behind me, which would otherwise have 
been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, 
that I might begin where 1 left oftj was of their own 
part; and I desired he would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little variety in that part, for 
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, 
they having \ery calm weather and a smooth sea , 
for his countrymen it could not be doubted, he said, 
but that they were overjoyed to see him (It seems 
he was the principal man among them, the captain 
of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having 
lieen dead some time) 'J'hey were, he said, the 
more surprised to see him, because they knew that 
he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, 
they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did 
all the rest of the prisoners ; that when he told them 
the story of his deliverance, and in what manner he 
was furnished for cairying them away, it was like a 
dream to them ; and their astonishment, they said, 
was something like that of Joseph’s brethren, when 
he told them who he was, and told them the story 
of his exaltation in Pharaoh’s court; but when he 
showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and the 
provisions that he brought them for theii journey 
or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a 

[89J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


just share of the joy of their deliverance, and imme- 
diately prepared to come away with him. 

Their first business was to get canoes ; and in this 
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the 
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their fnendly 
savage.s, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguaa, 
on pretence of going out a-hshing, or for Measure. 

In these they came away the next morning. It 
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or pro- 
visions, or anything in the world, but what they had 
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used 
to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered 
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the island ; leaving three of the most 
impudent, hardened, ungovemed, disagreeable villains 
behind me that an^ man could desire to meet with, 
to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappoint- 
ment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when 
the Spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provisions and other relief, as I 
had orderw them to do ; also they gave them the 
long paper of diiections, which I had left with them, 
containing the particular methods which I took for 
managing e>ery part of my life there; the way how 
I baked my breaa, bred up tame goats, and planted 
my com ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, 
and, in a word, everything I did. AD this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of 
whom understood English weU enough ; nor did they 
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with everything 
else, for they agreed very well for some time. They 
gave them an equal admi,ssion into the house, or 
cave, and they b^an to hve very sociably ; and the 
[ 40 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my 
methods, and Friday's father together, managed all 
their afiairs; for as for the Englishmen, they did 
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, 
and catch tortoises, and when they came home at 
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for 
them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with 
this, would the other but have let them alone; 
which, however, they could not find in their hearts 
to do long ; but like the dog in the manger, they 
would not eat themselves, and would not let others 
eat neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at 
first but tnvial, and such as are not worth relating ; 
but at last it broke out into open war, and it begun 
with all the rudeness and insolence that can be 
imagined, without reason, without provocation, con- 
trary to nature, and indeed to common-sense ; and 
though, it is true, the first relation of it came from 
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the ac- 
cusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows, they 
could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 
I must supply a defect in my former relation , and 
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, 
that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, 
there happened a little quaiTel on board our ship, 
which I was afraid once would have turned to a 
second mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, 
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his 
assistance, parted them by force, and making two of 
the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them 
in irons ; and as they had been active in the former 
disoiders, and let ftdl some dangerous ugly woids 
the second time, he threatened to carry them in 
irons to England, and have them hanged there for 
mutiny, and running away with the ship. 



• ROBINSON CRUSOE 


This, it seems, though the captain did not intend 
to do it, frighted some other men in the ship ; and 
some of them had put it into the heads of the rest 
that the captain only gave them good words for the 
present till they should- come to some English port, 
and that then they should be all put into gaol, and 
tried for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it ; upon which it was desired that I, who 
still passed for a great man among them, should go 
down with the mate and .satisfy the men, and tell 
them that they might be a.ssured, if they behaved 
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for 
the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and 
after passing my honour’s w«»rd to them they ap- 
peared easy, and the more so when 1 caused the 
two men who were in irons to be released and 
forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor foi 
that pight, the wind also falling calm. Next morn- 
ing we found that our two men who had been laid 
in irons had stole each of them a musket and some 
other weapons , what powder or shot’ they had, we 
know not; and had taken the ship’s pinnace, which 
was not yet hauled up, and ran aw-ay with her to 
their companions in rogueiy on shore. 

As soon as we found this, I ordered the longboat 
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away 
they went to seek the rogues; but they could neither 
find them nor any of the rest , for they all fled into 
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. 
The mate was once resolved, in ju.stice to their 
roguery, to base destroyed their plantations, burnt 
all their household stuff and furniture, and left them 
to .shift without it ; but having no oivicr, he let it all 
alone, left everything as they found it, and bringing 
the pinnace away, came on board without them. 
[ 42 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


These two men made their number five ; but tbe 
other three villains were so much wickeder than 
these, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 
doors, to shift for themselves, and w'ould have noth- 
ing to do with them ; nor could they, for a gcxxi 
while, be }iersuade<l to give them any food. As for 
the Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi- 
ness began to go forward. The Spaniards woidd 
have peiMiadcd the three English brutes to have 
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they 
said, they might be all one family ; but they would 
not hear of it So the two poor fellows lived by 
themselves ; and finding nothing but industry and 
application w'ould make them live comfortably, they 

I ntched their tents on the noith shore of the island, 
lut a little nioi-e on the west, to be out of the dan- 
ger of the savages, who always landed on the east 
parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, oiii' to lodge in, 
and the other to lay up their maga/ines and stores 
in ; and the Spaniards having given them some corn 
for .seed, and especially some of the jxias which I had 
left them, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after 
tlie pattern I had set for them all, and began to live 
piettv well. Their first crop of corn was on the 
ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land 
which they had dug up at first, having had but a 
little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and 
find them with bread and other eatables ; and one of 
the fellows being the cook’s mate of the ship, was 
\eiy ready at making soup, puddings, and other such 
preparations as the rice and the milk, and such little 
flesh as they got, furnished him to do 

They weie going on in this little thriving posture, 
when the thiee unnatural rogues, their own country- 
[431 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came 
and bullied them, and told them the island was 
theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had given 
them possession of it, and nobody else had any 
right to it, and damn 'em, they should build no 
houses upon their ground, unless they would pay 
them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jested at first, 
asked them to come in and sit down, and see what 
fine houses they were that they had built, and tell 
them what rent they demanded ; and one of them 
mernly told them if they were ground-landlords, he 
hoped if they built tenements upon their land and 
made impiovements, they would, aceoiding to the 
custom of landlords, grant them a long lease , £uid 
bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. 
One of the three, damning and raging, told them 
they should see they were not in jest ; and going to 
a little place at a distance, where the hone.st men 
had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a 
firebrand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, 
and very fairly set it on fire , and it would have been 
all burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two 
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod 
the fire out with his feet, and that not without some 
difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's 
thrusting him away, that he returned upon him with 
a pole he had in nis hand ; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, see- 
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, 
and immediately they came both out with their 
muskets ; and the man that was first struck at with 
the pole knocked the fellow down that had begun 
the quarrel with the .stock of his musket, and ^at 
before the other two could come to help him , and 
[ 44 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


then seeing the rest come at them, they stood to- 
gether, and presenting the other ends of their pieces 
to them, bade them stand oftl 

The other had firearms with them too , but one of 
the two honest men, bolder than his eomra/le, and 
made desperate by his danger, told them if they 
offered to move hand or fiK>t they were dead men, 
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but see- 
ing him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and 
they consented to take their wounded man with 
them, and be gone ; and, indeed, it seems the fellow 
was wounded sufficiently witli the blow. However, 
they were much in the wrong, since they had the 
advantage, that they did not disarm them effect- 
ually, as they might have done, and have gone im- 
mediately to the Spaniards, and given them an 
account how the rogues had treated them . for the 
three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every 
day gave them some intimation that they did so 
But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
lesser part of their roguenes, such as treading down 
their com, shooting tlii'ee young kids and a she- 
goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame 
for their store, and in a wend, plaguing them night 
find day in this manner, it forced the two men to 
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them 
all three the first time they had a fair opportunity. 
In order to this they resolved to go to the ca.stle, as 
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the 
three rogues and the Spaniards all liven together at 
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the 
Spaniards should stand by to see fair play. So they 
got up in the moriiiiig before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, 
telling a Spaniard that answered that they wanted 
to sneak with them. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


It happened that the day before two of the Span- 
iards having been in the woods had seen one of the 
two Englishmen, whom for distinction I call the 
honest men, and he had made a sod complaint to 
the Spnnia«ls of the barbarous usage they had met 
with from their three countrymen, and how they 
had rained their plantation, and destroyed their 
corn, that they had laboured so hard to bring for- 
ward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids, 
which was all they had provided for their sustenance . 
and that if he and his friends, meaning the Span- 
laiils, did not assist them again, they should be 
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, 
and they were all at supper, he took the freedom to 
repnive the three Englishmen, though in very gentle 
and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could 
be so ciuel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows, 
and that they were only putting themselves in a 
way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost 
them' a great deal of pains to bring things to such 
perfection as they had 

One of the Englishmen returned lery briskly. 
What had they to do there'' that they came on 
shore without leave, and they should not pl.int or 
build upon the island , it was none of their ground 
“ Why,” says the Spaniard, very calmly, “ Seignior 
Inglese, they must not starve” The Englishman 
replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, “ They 
might starve and be damned, they should not plant 
nor build.” “ But what must they do then, sei- 
gnior '' ” .said the Spaniaixl. Another of the brutes 
returned, “ Do ' d — n 'em, they should lie servants, 
and work for them.” “ But how can you expect 
that of them ? ” says the Spaniard ; “ they are not 
bought with your money , you have no right to 
, make them servants ” The Englishman answered, 
.the island was theirs, the governor heui given it to 
\ [ 46 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


them, and no man had anything to do there but 
themselves ; and with that swore Ijy his Maker that 
they would go and burn all their new huts, they 
should build none upon their land. 

“ Why, seignior,” says the Spaniard, “ by the 
same rule, we must be your servants too.” “ Ah,” 
says the bold dog, “ and so you shall too, before we 
have done with you;” mixing two or three G — d 
damme 's in the proper intervals of his speech. The 
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no an- 
swer. However, this little discourse had heated 
them . and starting up, one snvs to the other, I 
think it was he they called Will Atkins, “Come, 
Jock, let us go and liave t’other biush with them , 
we ’ll demolish their ca.stle, I ’ll warrant you ; they 
shall plant no colony in our dominions.” 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every 
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some 
insolent things among themselves of what they would 
do to the Spaiiiaids too when opportunity offered. 
But the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly 
understand them as to know all the particulars ; only 
that, in general, they threatened them hard for 
taking the two Englishmen’s part. 

Wliither they went, or how tliey bestowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not 
know , but it seems they waiidcied about the country 
part of the night , and then lying down in the place 
which I used to call niy bower, they were weary, and 
ovei slept themselves. T'lie case was this: they had 
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the 
two poor men when they were asleep , and as they 
acknowledged afterwards, intended to set fire to 
their huts while they were in them and either bum 
them 111 them, oi munler them, as thw oartie out ; 
and as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very 
strange they shuCild not have been kept waking. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Ifowiever, as the two men had also a design upon 
^hem, as I have said, though a much fairer one than 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very 
luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, 
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest man, called 
out to his comrades, “ Ha ' Jack, here ’s the nest, 
but d — n ’em, the birds are down ” They mused 
awhile to think what should be the occasion of their 
being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently 
that the Spaniards had given them notice of it , and 
with that they shook hands, and swore to one an- 
other that they would be i-evengeil of the Spaniards 
As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, thev 
fell to work with the poor men’s habitation They 
did not set fire indeed to anything, but thev pulled 
down both their little houses, and pulled them so 
limb from limb, that they left not the least stick 
standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they 
stood ; they tore all their little c-ollected household 
stuff in pieces, and threw everytliing about in such 
a manner, that the poor men afterwaids found some 
of then things a mile off of their habitation 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the 
young trees the poor men had planted ; pulled up an 
enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and 
their com ; and in a word, sacked and plundei-ed 
everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would 
have done. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find 
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever 
they had been, though they w'ere but two to three , 
so that, had they met, there certainly would have 
been bloodshed among them ; for they were all very 
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

asunder than they themselves could do to meet; for 
as if they had dogged one another, when the tliiee 
were gone thither, the two w'ere here , and afterwards, 
when the two went back, to find them, the three were 
come to the old habitation again ; we shall see their 
differing conduct presently. When the thi'ee came 
back, like furious creatures, flushed with the rage 
which the work they had been about had put them 
into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them 
what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado ; 
and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, 
as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes 
hold of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving 
it a twirl about, sneenng in his face, says he to him, 
“ And you. Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the 
same sauce if >ou do not mend your manners.” The 
Spaniaid, who though a quiet, civil man, was as 
brave as a man could be desired to be, and withal a 
strong, well-made man, looked steadily at him for 
a good while, and then, having no weajion in his 
hand, stepped gravely up to him, and with one blow 
of his fist knocked him dowm, as an ox is felled with 
a pole-axe ; at which one of tlie rogues, insolent as 
the first, find his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. 
He missed his body indeed, for the bullets went 
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip 
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than 
he really was, and that put him into some heat, for 
before he acted all in a jierfect calm ; but now re- 
solving to go through with his wmrk, he stooped to 
take the fellow’s niusket whom hc’had knocked down, 
and was just going to shoot the man who had fired 
at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the 
cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they 
stepped in, secured the other two, and took their 
arms from them

When they were thus disarmed, and found they 
had made all the S[ianiards their enemies, as well 
as their own country men, they began to cool , and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their aims again. But the Spaniards, considering 
the feud that was between them and the other two 
Englishnion, and that it would be the best method 
they could take to keep them from killing one 
another, told them they would do them no hann ; 
and if they would live peaceably, they would be very 
willing to assist and associate with them, as they 
did before ; but that they could not think of giving 
them their arms again while they appeared so i-e- 
solved to do mi.schief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to 
make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear 
reason than to act reason ; and being refused their 
arms, "they went raving away, and raging like mad- 
men, threatening what they would do, though they 
had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising their 
threatening, told them they should take care how 
they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle, 
for if they did, they would .shoot them as they would 
do ravenous beasts, wherever they found them , and 
if they fell into their hands alive, they should cer- 
tainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool- 
ing them , but away they went, raging and swearing 
like funcs of hell As soon as they were gone, came 
back the two men in passion and I’age enough also, 
though of another kind , tor having been at their 
plantation, and finding it all demolished and de- 
stroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had 
provocation enough. They could s<-arce have mom to 
tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them 
theire; and it was strange enough to find three men 
thus bully nineteen, and receive no punushment at all. 

[ 50 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


The Spaniards indeed despised them, and espe- 
cially having thus dii^rined them made light of all 
their threatenings ; but the two Englishmen resolved 
to have their remedy against them, what pain soever 
it cost to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interpmsed here too, and told 
them that as they had disarmed them, they could 
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them 
with fiiearms, and perhaps kill them. “ But,” said 
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, “ we 
vill endeavour to make them do you justii'e, if you 
will leave it to us, for as there is no doubt out 


they will come to us again when their pa.ssion is 
over, being not able to subsist without our assist- 
ance, we promise you to make no peace with them 
without having a full satisfaction for you ; upon this 
condition we hope you will pramise to use no vio- 
lence with them, other than in your own defence.” 

The two Engii.shmen yielded to this very awkwardly, 
and with great reluctance , but the Spanish protests 
they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and 
to make all ea^ at last. “ For,” said they, “ we are 
not so many of us , here is room enough for us all, 
and it Is great pity we should not be all good friends.” 
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue 
of the thing, living foi some days w ith the Spaniaixls, 
for their ow n habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days’ time the three vagrants, tired 
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles’ eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove, and flnding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, 
they came up in a very submissive, humble mnuner, 
and begged to be received again into tlie family. 
The Spaniards used tliera civilly, but told them they 
had acted so unnaturally bv their countrymen, and 
[ 51 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they 
could not come to any conclusion without consulting 
the two Englishmen and the rest ; but, however, they 
would go to them, and discourse about it, and they 
should know in half-aii-hour. It may be guessed 
that they were very hard put to it, foi it seems, as 
they were to wail this half-hour foi an answer, they 
begged he w'ould send them out some bresid in the 
meantime ; which he did, and sent them at the same 
tune a large piece of goat’s flesh and a broiled parrot, 
which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry 
enough. 

After half-an-hour’s consultation they were called 
in, and a long debate had among them, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their 
labour, and a design to murder them , all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. 
Upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator 
between them ; and as they had obliged the two 
Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were 
naked and unarmed, so they now obliged tlie three 
to go and build their fellows’ two huts, one of the 
same, and the other of larger dimensions than they 
were liefore ; to fence their ground again, where they 
had pulled up the fences, plant trees in the room of 
those pulled up, dig up the land again for planting 
coni, where they had .spoiled it ; and, in a word, to 
restore everything in the same state they found it, 
as near as they could ; for entirely it could not be, 
the season for the coni, and the growth of the trees 
and hedges, not being -possible to be rec-overed. 

Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had 
plenty, of provisions given them all the while, they 
grew very oiderly, and the whole society liegaii to 
live pleasantly and agreeably together ; only that 
these three fellows could never be persuaded to work, 
I mean for themselves, except now and then a little, 
[521 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


just as they pleased. However, the Spaniards told 
them plainly that if they would but live sociably and 
friendly together, and study in the whole the good 
of the plantation, th^ would be content to wort for 
them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they 
pleased , and thus having lived pretty well together 
for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms 
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them 
as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began 
to be insolent and troublesome as before , but, how- 
ever, an accident happening presently upon this, 
which endangered the safety of them all, they were 
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look 
to the preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard Mvem- 
or, as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniai'd whose 
life I hid saved, who was now the captain, or leader, 
or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in 
the night, and could by no means get any sleep. 
He was perfectly well in body, as he told me the 
story, only found his thoughts tumultuous , hi.s 
mind ran upon men dghting, and. killing of one 
anothei, but was broad awake, and could not by any 
means get any sleep In shoit, he lay a great 
while , but growing more and more uneasy, he re- 
solved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, 
upon goat's-skins, laid thick upon such couches and 
pads as they made for themselves, not in ham- 
mocks and ship-beds, as I did, who was but one , so 
they had little to do, when they were willing t<j rise, 
but to get up upon their feet, and perhaps put on a 
coat, such as it was, and their pumps, and they were 
ready for going any way that their thoughts guided 
them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out , but being 

[ 63 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


dark, he could see little or nothing ; and besides, the 
trees which I had planted, as in my formei account 
is descnbed, and which were now grown tall, inter- 
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and 
see that it was a clear stailigfit night, and hearing 
no noise, he returned and laid him down again ; but 
it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he com- 
pose himself to anything like rest, but his thoughts 
were to the last degiee uneasy, and yet he knew not 
for uhat. 

Having made some noise n ith rising and walking 
about, going out and coining in, another of them 
waked, and calling, asked who it was that was up. 
The governoi told him how it had been with him 
“Sav jou so?” says the other Rpaniaid , “such 
things are not to be slighted, I assure you, there is 
certainly some mischief woiking,” says he, “near 
us ; ” and presently he asked him, “ Where are the 
Englishmen ? ” “ They are all in their huts,” says he, 

“sale enough.” It seems the Spaniaids had kept 
possession of the main apartment, and had made a 
place where the tliiee Englishmen, since their last 
mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and could 
not come at the rest “Well,” says the Spaniaid, 
“there IS something in it, I am pci-suaded fiom my 
own experience I am satisfied our spirits embodied 
have a converse with, and i-eeeive intelligence from, 
the .spirits unem bodied, and inhabiting the invisible 
world , and this friendly notice is given for our ad- 
vantage, if we know how to make use of it. Come,” 
says he, “ let us go out and look abioad , and if we 
find pothing at all in it to justify the trouble, I will 
tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince 
you of the justice of my pioposing it.” 

In a woixl, they went out to go up to the top of 
the hill, where I used to go ; but they, being strong, 
and in good company, not alone, as I was, used none 
[ 54 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and then 
pulling it up after them to go up a second stage to 
the top, but were going round through the gtove, 
unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised 
with seeing a light, as of fire, a very little way off 
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one 
or two, but of a great nunibcT. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages 
landing on the island, it was my constant cai'e to 

E revent them making the least discovery of there 
sing any inhabitint ujxrn the place; and wlien by 
anv occasion they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectu vlly, that they that got away were scarce able 
to give any aifount of it, for we dwippeared as soon 
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me escape 
to tell any one else, except it were the three savages 
in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat, of 
whom I men tinned that I was afraid they should go 
homo and bring more help. 

Waethorit was the conser|ucncc of the escape of 
those men that so great a number came now together, 
or whetlier they came ignorantly, and by awideiit, 
on their usual bloody eirand, they could not, it 
seems, understand ; but whatever it was, it had been 
their business, either to have concealed themselves, 
as not to have seen them at all, much less to have 
let the savages have seen that there were any inhab- 
I tan Is in the place , or to have fallen upon them so 
effectually, as that nut a man of them should have 
escaped, which could only hav« been by getting in 
between them and their boats. But this presence of 
mind was wanting to them, which wa.s the ruin of 
their trannuillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the govenior and the 
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back 
immediately, and raised their fellow'.s, giving them an 
account of the imminent danger they were all in. and 
[65f 



ROBIlSrSON CRUSOE 


they amin as readily took the alarm ; but it was im- 
possible to persuade them to stay close within where 
they wei'e, but that they must run all out to see how 
things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to 
view them by the light of three fires they had made 
at a distance from one another What they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themsebes they 
knew not ; for, first, the enemy were too many ; 
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were 
divided into several parties, and were on shore in 
several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at 
this sight ; and as they found that the fellows ran 
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt 
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place, where 
they would see the token of inhabitants ; and they 
were in -great perplexity also for fear of their flock of 
goats, which would have been little less than starving 
them if they should have been destroyed , so the first 
thing they resolved upon, was to despatch three men 
away before it was light, viz., two Spiniards and one 
Eiigli.shman, to dnvc all the goats away to the great 
valley where the cave was, and if need were to drive 
them into the very cave itself 

Could they have seen the savages all together in 
one body, and at any distance from their canoes, they 
resolved, if they had. been an hundred of them, to 
have attacked them , but that could not be obtained, 
for they were some of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwaids, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course 
they should take, and beaten their brains in con- 
sidering their present circumstances, they resolved at 

[ 56 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


last, while it was dark, to send the old savage, Friday’s 
father, out os a spy, to learn if possible something 
concerning them, wWt they came for, and what they 
intended to do The old man readily undertook it, 
and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the 
savages were, away he went. After he had lieen gone 
an hour or two, he brings word that he had been 
among them undiscovered, that he found they were 
two parties, and of two several nations, who had war 
with one another, and had had a great battle in their 
own country, and that both sides having had several 

t insoiiers t.iken in the fight, they were by mere chance 
andod ,dl in the same island for the devouring their 
prisoners, and making merry, but their coming so by 
chance to the same place hail spoilwl all their 
mirth , that tliey were in a great rage at one another, 
and that they were so near, that ho believed they 
would fight again as soon as daylight liegan to 
appear, but ho did not perceive that they had any 
notion of anybody’s being on the island but them- 
selves. He had hardly made an end of telling his 
story, when they could pen-eive, by the unusual 
noise they made, that the two little armies were 
engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday’s fathci used all the arguments he could to 
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen. He 
told them their safety consisted in it, and that they 
hail nothing to do but he still, and the savages 
would kill one another to their hands, and then the 
rest would go away , and it was so to a tittle. But 
it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the 
Englishmen, their curiosity was so importunate upon 
their piiidentlals, that they must run out and see 
the battle However, they used some caution too, 
vi/., they did not go openly just by their own dwell- 
ing, blit went farther into the woods, and placed 
themselves to advantage, where they might securely 
[ 57 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, 
not to be seen by them : but it seems the savages 
did see them, as we shall find hereafter. 

'riie battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englishmen, one of them said he could peiceive 
that smno of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible spint, and of gieat policy in guiding the 
fight The battle, they said, held two hours before 
they could guess which party would be beaten , but 
then that party which was iieaiest our people’s 
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some 
tune more, some of them ta'gan to fly , and this put 
our men again into a great consternation, lest any 
of those that fled should run into the giove before 
their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involuntarily 
discover the place, and that by consequence the 
pui'suers should do the like in scanh for them. 
I'pon this they resolved that they would stand 
armed within t1ie wall, and whoever came into the 
grove they should sally out over the wall and kill 
them, so that if possible not one .should return to 
give an account of it. Tliey ordered, also, that it 
shouhl be done with their svvoids, or by knocking 
them down with the .stock of the musket, but not 
by shooting tlieni, foi feai of the noise 

As they expected, it fell out. Thiee of the routed 
army fled for life, and crossing the cieek ran directly 
into the place, not in the least knowing whither 
they went, but running as into a thick wood for 
shelter. The scout they kept to look abioad gave 
notice of this within, with this addition, to our 
men’s great satisfaction, viz., that the conquerors 
had not pursued them, or seen which way they were 
gone. Upon' this the Spaniard governor, a man of 
humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three 
fugitives; but sending three men out by the top 
of the hill, ordei-ed them to go round and come in 
[ 58 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


behind them, surprise, and take them prisoners', 
which was done. The residue of the conquered people 
fled to their canoes, and got off to sea ; the victoi's 
retired, and made no pursuit, or very little, but draw- 
ing themselves into a body together gave two great 
screaming shouts, which they supposed was by wav 
of triumph, and so the fight ended ; and the same 
day, about three o’clock in the afternoon, they also 
maiched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards 
had their island again free to themselves, their 
fnght was over, and they saw no savages in several 
years after 

After they were all gone, the Spaniaifk came out 
of their den, and viewing the field of battle, they 
found about two and thirty dead men upon the spot. 
Some were killed with great long arrows, some of 
which were found sticking in their bodies , but most 
of them were killed with their great wooden swords, 
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the 
field of battle, and as many bows, with a great 
many arrows These swords were strange great un- 
wieldy things, and they must be very strong men 
that used tlieni Most of those men that were 
killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, 
as we may sa>, or, as we call it in English, their 
brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs 
broken ; so tliat ’t is evident thev fight with inex- 
pressible rage and fury. We found not one wounded 
man that was not stone dead , for either they stay 
by their enemy till they have quite killed him, or 
they carry all the wounded men, that are not quite 
dead, away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a 
great while. The sight had filled them with honor, 
and the consequences appeared terrible to the last 
degree, even to them, if ever they should fall into 
the hands of those creatuiw, who would not onlv 
[ 59 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


kill them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we 
kill our cattle And they professed to me that the 
thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton, 
though it was supposed it was not to be till the^ 
were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it 
nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when 
they thought of it, and tilled then minds with such 
unusual terror, that they were not themselves for 
some weeks after. 

nds, as I said, tamed even the thi*ce English 
brutes I have been speaking of, and for a great while 
after they were very tractable, and went about the 
common business of their whole society well enough , 
planted, sowed, leaped, and began to Ix; all naturalised 
to the country But some time after this they fell 
all into such measures as brought them into a great 
deal of trouble. 

They had taken thi’ee prisoners, as I had observed , 
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, 
they made them servants, and taught them to work 
for them, and as slaves they did well enough ; but 
they did not take their measures with them as I did 
by my man Friday, viz., to begin with them upon 
the principle of having saved their lives, and then 
instruct them in the rational principles of life, much 
less of religion, civilising and reducing them by kind 
usage and affectionate arguings , but as they gave 
them their food every day, .so they gave them their 
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery 
enough , but they failed in this by it, that they 
never had them to assist them and fight for them as 
I had my man Friday, who was as tiue to me as the 
very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now 
good friends — for comnion danger, as I said above, 
had effectually recoiicili*d them — they began to 
consider their general ciministances , and the first 
[(»] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


thing that came under their consideration was, 
whether, seeing the sa\agc8 particularly haunted 
that side of the island, and that there were more re- 
mote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their 
way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, 
they should not rather remove their habitation, and 
plant in some more proper place for their safety, 
and especially for the security of their cattle and 
com. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded 
that they would not remove their habitation, be- 
cause that, some time or other, they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, meaning me ; 
and if I should send any one to seek them, I should 
be sure to direct them to that side, where, if they 
should find the place deinolislied, they would con- 
clude the savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and so our supply would go too. 

But as to their com and cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as projier for both, and where 
indeed there was land enough. However, upon 
second thoughts they altered one part of that reso- 
lution too, and resolved only to remove part of thou 
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there , 
and so, if one part was destrtiyed, the otlier might 
be saved. And one part of prudence they used, 
' which it was very well they did, vnz., that they nev ci 
trusted those three savages, which they had prison- 
el’s, with knowing anything of the plantation they 
had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had 
there ; much less of the cave there, which they kept 
in case of necessity as a safe retreat, and whither 
the\ carried also the two barrels of powder which I 
had sent them at my coming away. 

But, however, they I’esolved not to change their 
habitation ; yet they agreed that as I had carefully 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


covered it first with a wall, or fortification, and then 
with a {ffove of trees, so seeing their safety consisted 
entirely in their being concealed, of which they were 
now fully com meed, they set to work to cover and 
conceal the place yet more effectually than before 
To this purpose, as I had planted trees (or rather 
thrust in stakes which in time all grew up to be 
trees) for some good distance before the entrance 
into my apartment, thev went on in the same manner, 
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, 
from the trees I had set quite down to the side of 
the cieck, where, as I said, I landed my floats, and 
even in the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so 
much as leaving any plac-e to land, or any sign that 
there had been any landing thereabout These 
stakes also being of a vvcxid very forwaid to grow, as 
I have noted fornierlv, they took care to have gener- 
ally very rriueli huger and taller than those which 
I had planted , and as they grew apace, so they 
planted them so vciy thick and close together, that 
when they had been three or four years grown, there 
was no piercing with the, eye any considerable way 
into the plantation And as for that pait which I 
had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man’s 
thigh ; and among them they placed so many other 
shoit ones, and so thick, that, in a woid, it stood 
like a palisado a (juai'ter of a mile thick, and it was 
next to impossilile to penetrate it but w'ith a little 
army to cut it all down , fora little dog could hardly 
get between the trees, they stood so close 

But this was not all , for they did the same by all 
the ground to the light hand, and to the left, and 
round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, 
not so much as for themselves to come out but by the 
ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then 
lifted up and placed again from the first stage up to 
the top ; which ladder, when it was taken down, 

[6SJ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist 
it could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less 
than what they afterwards found occasion for , which 
served to convince me, that as human prudence has 
the authority of Providence to justify it, so it has, 
doubtless, the direction of Providence to set it to work ; 
and would we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am 
fully persuaded we might prevent iiwuiy of the dis- 
asters which our lives are now, by our own n^li- 
gence, subjected to. But this by the way. 

I return to the story. They lived two years after 
this ill perfect retirement, and had no more visits 
from the savages. They had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them into a great 
consternation , for some of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the west side, or rather the 
end of the island, which, by the way, was that end 
where I never went, for fear of being discovered, 
they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes 
of Indians just coming on shore. They mode the 
best of their way home in hmry enough, and giving 
the alarm to their comiades, they kept close all that 
day and the next, going out only at night to make 
observation But they had the good luck to be 
mistaken, for wherever the savages went, they did 
not land at that time in the island, but pui-sued 
some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three 
Englishmen, one of whiih, a most turbulent fellow, 
being in a rage at one of the three slaves, which I 
had mentioned they had taken, because the fellow 
had not done something light which he bid him do, 
and seemed a little untractable in his showing him, 
drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore 
it by his side, and fell upon tlie poor savage, not to 
correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

who was bvt seeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, 
but struck into his shoulder so that he thought he 
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and 
entreating him not to murder the poor man, clapped 
in between him and the savage to prevent the 
mischief. 

The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck 
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he 
would SCI ve him as he intended to serve the savage ; 
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, 
and with a shovel which he had in his hand (for 
they were all working in the field about their corn- 
land) knocked the brute down. Another of the 
Englishmen running at the same time to help his 
comrade, knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two 
Spaniaids moie came in to help their man, and a 
third Engli.shmaii fell in upon them. ITiey had 
none of them any fiiearm.s, or any other wea|)on but 
hatchets and other tools, except this third English- 
man , he had one of old rusty cutlasses, with 
which he made at the two last Spanianls, and 
wounded them both. This fray set the whole family 
in an uproar, and moie help coming in, they took 
the three Englishmen pri.soners The next question 
was, what should lie done %vith them ^ They had 
been so often mutinous, and were so furious, so des- 
perate, and .so idle withal, that they knew not what 
course to take with them, for they were mischievous 
to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they 
did to any man , so that, in short, it was not safe to 
live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so 
many w'ords, that if thev had been of his own coun- 
try he would have hanged them ; for all laws and all 
governors were to preserve society, and those who 
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


out of it , but as thev were Englishmen, and that it 
was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that 
they all owed their preser\ation and deliverance, he 
would use them with all possible lenity, and would 
leave them to the judgment of the other two English- 
men, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up and 
said, they desired it might not be left to them, 
“ For,” says he, “ I am sure we ought to sentence 
them to the gallows ; ” and with that he gives an 
account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had pra- 
posed to have all the five Englishmen join together, 
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in 
their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this he csdls to 
William Atkins, “ How, Seignior Atkins,” says he, 
“ would you murder us all •“ What have you to say 
to that ? ” That hardened villain was so far from 
denying it, that he said it was true, and Gr — d d — m 
him if they would not do it still before they had 
done with them. “ Well but, Seignior Atkins,” says 
the Spaniard, “ what have we done to you that you 
would kill U.S ? And what would you get by killing 
us ^ And what must we do to prevent you killing us? 
Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why will you 
put us to the necessity of this. Seignior Atkins?” 
says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Span- 
iard’s making a jest of it that had he not been held 
by three men, and withal had no weapons with him, 
it was thought he would have attempted to have killed 
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company 

This hail -brained carnage obliged them to con- 
sider seriously what was to be done. The two 
Englishmen and the Spaniard who .saved the poor 
savage was of the opinion they should hang one of 
the three for an example to the rest; and that, 
VOL. n — 5 [ 65 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


particularly, it should be he that had twice at- 
tempted to commit murder with his hatchet, and 
indeed there was some reason to believe he had done 
it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con- 
dition with the wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. 

But the governoi Spaniard still said. No . it was 
an Englishman that had saved all their li\cs, and he 
would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
though he had niuidered half of them , nay, he said, 
if he hud been killed himself b\ an Englishman, and 
had tune left to speak, it should be that they would 
pardon him. 

This W'as so positively insisted on by the governor 
Spaniard, that theie was no gaiiisnjing it, and as 
merciful counsels are nio.st apt to prevail wheie they 
are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it , 
but then it was to be consideied what should be 
done to keep them fiom doing the mischief they 
designed ; for all agi'eed, governor and all, that 
means were to be used for preserving the society 
from danger After a long debate it was agieeci, 
liI^t, that thev should be disainied, and not per- 
mitted to have either gun, or powder, or shot, oi 
sword, or any weapon, and should be turned out of 
the society, and left to live where they would, and 
how they would, by themselves, but that none of 
the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse 
with them, speak with them, oi have anything to 
do with them , that they should be forbid to come 
within a ecrtain distance of the pine e where the rest 
dwelt, and that if they offcied to commit any dis- 
order, so as to spoil, bum, kill, oi destroy any of 
the com, plantings, buddings, fences, or cattle be- 
longing to the society, they shouM die w ithout 
mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they 
could find them. 

[ 66 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


The governor, a man of great humanity, musing 
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and 
turning to the tivo hone>t Englishmen said, “ Hold, 
you must reflect that it will be long ere they can 
raise corn and cattle of tlicii own, and they must 
not starve , we must therefore allow them provi- 
sions.” So he caused to be added, that they should 
have a proportion of corn given to them to last them 
eight months, and for scm to sow, by which time 
they might be supposed to raise some of their own ; 
that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, 
and SIX kids given them, as well for present subsist- 
ence as for a store ; and that they should have 
tools given them for their work in the fields; such 
as SIX hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like ; but 
they should have none of these tools or provisions 
unless they would swear solemnly that they would 
not hurt or iniure aiiv of the Spaniards with them, 
or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they disinisseu them the society, and turned 
them out to shift for themselves. They went away 
sullen and refiactory, as neither contented to go 
away or to stay, but as there was no leiiiedy they 
went, pretending to go and choose a plac-e w'here 
they would settle themselves, to plant and live by 
themselves , and some provisions were given them, 
but no weapons 

About four or five days after they came again for 
some victuals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked 
themselves out an habitation and plantation , and it 
was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest 
part of the island, N.E., much about the place where 
I landed in my first voyage when I was driven out 
to sea, the Lord knows whither, in my attempt to 
surround the island. 

Here they built themselves twm handsome huts, 

[ 67 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and cnntri\cd them in a manner like my first habita- 
tion, being close under the side of a hill, having some 
trees growing already on three sides of it , so that by 
planting othere it Mould be yery easily covered fiom 
the sight, unless narrowly seaiflied for I'hey de- 
sired some diied goatVskins for beds and coveinig, 
which were given them ; and upon giving their woids 
that they would not disturb the lest, or injiiie any 
of their plantations, they gave them hatchets and 
what other tools they c-oiild spare, some peas, barley, 
and rice fur sowing, and in a word, anything they 
wanted but arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six 
months, and hod gotten in their fiist harvest, though 
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they 
had planted lieing but little, foi indeed having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands , and when they came to make 
boards, and pots, and such things, they weie quite 
out of their element, and could make nothing of it ; 
and when the rainy .season came on, foi want of a 
cave III the earth they could not keep their grain diyi, 
and it was in gi-eat danger of spoiling And this 
humbled them much , so they came and begged the 
Spaniaids to help them, which they verv readily did ; 
and in four days worked a great hole in the side of 
the hill for them, big enough to secure then com 
and otliei things fiom the rum But it was but a 
poor place at licst compared to mine, and espc'cially 
as mine was then , for the Spaniards had greatly en- 
laiged it, and made seveial new" apartments in it. 

About three quartere of a year after this separation 
a new frolic took the.se revues, which, together with 
the former villainy they had committed, brought 
mischief enough upon them, and had very near bren 
the ruin of the whole colony. The three new asso- 
ciates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious 
[681 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


life they led, and that without hope of bettering 
their circumstances ; and a whim took them that they 
would make a voyage to the continent from whence 
the savages came, and would try if they could not 
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, 
and bring them home, so to make them do the labo- 
rious part of their work for them. 

The project was not so preposterous if they had 
gone no farther ; but they did nothing, and proposed 
nothing, but had either mischief in the design, or 
mischief in the event ; and if I may give my opinion, 
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven , for if 
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible 
ci'imes, how shall we reconcile the events of things 
with the Divine justice? It was certainly an appar- 
ent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy 
that brought tliem to the state they were in , and as 
they showed not the least remorse for the eriine, but 
added new villainies to it, such as, particularly, the 
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave 
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand 
to do what he was .directed, and to wound him in 
such a manner as, no question, made him a cripple 
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medi- 
cine could be had for his cure , and what was still 
worse, the murderous intent, or to do justice to the 
crime, the intentional murder, for such to be sure it 
was, as was aflerwaids the formed design they all laid 
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the storj. 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and in very humble terms d&sircd to be 
admitt^ to speak with them. The Spaniaids \ery 
readily heard what they bad to say, which was this, 
that they were tired of living in the manner they 
did ; that they were not handy enough to make the 

[ 69 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


necessaries they wanted ; and that, having no help, 
they found they should be starved ; but if the Span- 
iards would give them leave to take one of the ca- 
noes which they came over in, and give them arms 
and amiimiiition proportioned for their defence, they 
would go over to the mam, and seek their fortune, 
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying 
them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them , but yet very honestly represented to them 
the certain destruction they w'ere running into ; told 
them they had suffeied such haidships upon that 
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of 
propheev, tell them that they would be staived or 
oe murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should Ixj 
starve<l if they stayed here, for thej could not work, 
and would not work, and they could but be staived 
abroad ; and if tliey were murdered, there w-as an 
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry 
after them , and, in short, insisted importunately 
upon their demand declaring that they would go 
whether thev would give them any aims or no. 

The Spaniards told them with great kindness that 
if they were resolved to go, thev should not go like 
naked men, and be in no condition to defend them- 
selves, and that though they could ill .spare their 
firearms, having not enough for themselves, yet they 
would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a 
cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought 
was suflicient for them 

In a word, they accepted the offer, and having 
baked them bread enough to serve them a month, 
and given them as much goat’s flesh as they could 
eat while it was sweet, and a great basketful of dried 
grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a joung kid 
alive to kill, they Iioldly set out in a canoe for a 
[ 70 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles 
broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well earned fifteen or twenty men, and there- 
fore was mther too big for them to manage ; but as 
they had a fair breeze and the flood tide with them, 
they did well enough They had made a mast of a 
long pole, and a sail of four large goat’s-skins dried, 
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away 
they went merrily enough The Spaniards called 
after them. Bon veijajo , and no man ever thought 
of seeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often say to one another, 
and to the two honest Englishmen who remained 
behind, how c|Hietly and couifortably they lived now 
those three tiubulcnt fellows were gone. As for 
their e\er coming again, that was the remotest thing 
from their thoughts that could be imagined , when, 
behold, after two and twenty days’ absence, one of 
the Englishmen lanng abroad upon his planting 
work, sees thiee strange men eoimng towards him at 
a di.stnnee, witli guns u{h>ii their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman as if he was bewitched, 
comes fi iglitcd and amazed to the governor Spaniard, 
and tells him they were all undone, for there were 
sti angels landed upon the island, he could not tell 
wlio. The Spaiiiaid, pausing a while, says he to 
him, “How do you mean, you cannot tell who.'* 
They are the savages, to be sure.” “ No, no,” says 
the Englishman, “ they are men in clothes, with 
arms ” “ Nay, then,” says the Spaniard, “ why are 

you concerned ? If they are not savages, they must 
be friends , for there is no Chnstian nation upon 
earth but will do us good rather than harm.” 

While they were debating thus, comes the three 
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which 
was new planted, hallooed to them. They presently 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind 
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon 
another question, viz., what could be the matter, 
and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brouglit the men in , 
and incjuiring where they hM been, and what they 
had been doing, tliey gave them a full account of 
their vo\age in a few woids, viz., that they reached 
the land in two days, or something less, but finding 
the people alarmed at their coming, and piepanng 
with Ijowb and arrows to fight them, they durst not 
go on shore, but sailed on to the noithward six or 
seven houi-s, till they came to a great opening, by 
which they pereeicecl that the land they saw from 
our island was not the main, hut an island; that 
entering that opening of the sea, they saw another 
island on the right hand north, and several more 
west, and being resohed to land somewhere, they 
put over to one of the islands which lay west, and 
went Tioldly on shore ; that thi*y found the people 
very courteous and friendly to them, and that they 
gave them several roots, and some dried fish, and 
appeared very sociable; and the women, as well as 
the men, were verv forwairt to supply them with 
anything they could get for them to eat, and brought 
it to them a great way upon tlieir heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as 
well as they could of them by signs, what nations 
were this way, and that way ; and were told of seicral 
fierce and terrible people, that Ined almost every 
way , who, as they made signs to them, used to eat 
men ; but as for themselves, they said that they 
never ate men or women, except only such as 
they took in the wars ; and then they owmed that 
they made a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast 
of that kind, and they told him about two moons 
[72J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ago, pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; 
and that their great king had two hundred prisoners 
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were 
feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. 
The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those 
prisunei-s, but the other mistaking them, thought 
they were desirous to ha\e some of them to carry 
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to 
them, pointing to the .setting of the sun, and then 
to the rising ; which was to signify, that the next 
morning at sun-iisiiig they would bring some for 
them , and accordingly the next morning they 
brought down five women and eleven men, and 
gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them 
on their voyage, just as we would bring so many 
cows and oxen down to a seaport town to victum 
a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at 
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they 
did not know what to do. To refuse the piisonere 
would have been the highest affront to the savage 
gentry that offered them ; and what to do with 
them they knew not. However, upon some debates, 
they resolved to accept of them , and in return they 
gave the savages that brought them one of their 
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of 
their bullets, which thougli they did not understand, 
they seemed extremely pleased with ; and then tying 
the poor creatures’ hands behind them, they (the 
people) dragged the poor pnsoiiers into the boat 
for our men. 

The Englishmen wei'e obliged to come away as 
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them 
this noble jiresent would certainly have expected 
that they should have gone to work with them, have 
killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


But having taken their leave with all the respects 
and thanks that could well pa^s between people 
where, on either side, they undciNtood not one word 
they could say, they put off with their boat, and 
came back towaitls the first island, where when they 
arrived they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too man}' of them for their occasion 

III their voyage they endeavoured to have some 
communication with their prisoners, but it was im- 
possible to make them understand anything , noth- 
ing they could say to them, or gn e them, or do for 
them, but was looked u|)on as going about to mur- 
der them. They fii-st of all unbound tliem, but the 
poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women, 
as if they had just felt the knife at their throats , 
for they immediately concluded they were unbound 
on purpose to be killed. 

If they gave them anything to eat, it was the 
same, thing , then they concluded it was for fear 
they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough 
to Kill , if they looked at one of them more par- 
ticularly, the party presently concluded it was to 
see whethei he or she was fattest and fittest to kill, 
nay, after they had brought them cjuite o\ei, and 
began to use them kindly, and treat them w’ell, .still 
they expected every d.iy to make a dinner or supper 
for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac 
countable history or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard asked them where their new family was'' 
And being told that they had brought them on 
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were 
come up to beg some victuals foi them, they, the 
Spaniards and the other two Englishmen, that is to 
say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to 
the place and see them, and did so, and Friday’s 
father with them. 

[ 74 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When they came into the hut, there they sat all 
bound; for when they had brought them on shore 
they bound their hands, that they might not take 
the bo.it and make their escape. There, I say, they 
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three 
men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, stiaight and 
fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five yeai-s of age, 
and fixe w'omen, whereof two might be from thirty 
to foity, txvo more not alioxe four or five and twenty, 
and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen 
or seventeen. 'Fhe women were well favoured, agree- 
able pei-sons, both in shajje and features, only tawny ; 
and two of them, hail they been perfect white, would 
have p.asscd for veiy handsome women, even in lain- 
don itself, having pleasant, agreeable countenances, 
and of a very modest behaviour, especially when 
they came aftei wards to lie clothed, and dressed, as 
they called it, though the dress was very indifferent, 
it must be confessed, of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may lx* sure, was something un- 
couth to our Sfianiartls, who were, to give them a 
just chanu'ter, men of the best behaviour, of the 
most calm, sedate tempei-s, and perfect good-humour 
that ever I met with , and, in [larticular, of the most 
modesty, as will presently appear , I say, the sight 
was very uncouth to see thiee naked men and five 
naked w’oiiicn, all together bound, and iii the most 
iniser.ible circumstances that human natui’e could be 
supposed to be, vi/ , to be expecting every moment 
to be dragged out and have their brains knocked 
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is 
killed for a dainty 

The first thing they did was to cause the old 
Indian, Fiiday’s father, to go in and see first if he 
knew any of them, and then if he understood any of 
their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he 
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them ; 
[ 75 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


neither amid any of them understand a woi-d he 
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the 
women. 

However, this was enough to answer the end, 
which was to satisfy them that the men into whose 
hands they w ere fallen were Christians ; that they 
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they 
might be sure they w'ould not be killed. As soon as 
they were assural of this, they discoveiol such ]oy, 
and by such awkward and several ways as is hare) to 
describe, for it seems they were of several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid in 
the next place to ask them if they w’crc willing to be 
servants, and to work foi the men who had bnmght 
them away to save their lives!* At which they all 
fell a-dancing ; and presently one fell to taking up 
this, and another that, oi anything that lay next,' to 
carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were 
willing to work. 

The govenior, who found that the having women 
among them would presently be attended with some 
inconvenience, and might occasion .some .strife, and 
perhaps blood, asked the thi-ee men what they in- 
tended to do with the.se women, and how they in- 
tended to use them, whether as servants or as 
women ? One of the Englishmen answ'ered very 
holdly and readily, that they would use them as 
both. To which the governor said, “ I am not 
going to restrain you fitim it, you are your own 
masters as to that , but this I think is but just, for 
avoiding disorders and quairels amongst you, and I 
desire it of you for that reason only, viz., that you 
will all engage, that if any of you take any of these 
women as a woman, or wife, that he shall take but 
one ; and that having taken one, none else shall 
touch her , for though we cannot marry any of you, 
yet ’t is but reasonable that while yon stay here, the 
[ 76 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


woman any of you takes should be maintained by 
the man that takes her, and should be his wife ; I 
mean,” says he, “ while he continues here ; and that 
none else shall have anything to do with her.” All 
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it 
without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they 
designed to take any of them ? But every one of 
them answei-ed “ No.” Some of them said they had 
wives in Spain, and the others did not like women 
that were not Christians, and all together declared 
that they would not touch one of them ; which was 
an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in 
all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, the 
five Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is 
to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new 
form of living , for the Spaniards and Friday’s father 
lived in my old habitation, which they liad enlarged 
exceedingly within The three servants which w'ere 
taken in the late battle of the savages, lived with 
them , and these carried on the mam part of the 
colony, supplying all the lest with food, and assist- 
ing them in anything as they could, or as they found 
necessity required 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such 
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about 
these women, and that two of them .should not pitch 
upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three 
of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
than the other . but they took a good way enough 
to prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they 
.set the five women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew 
lots among them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by him- 
self to the hut where the poor naked creatures were, 
and fetched out her he chose , and it was worth ob- 
[ 77 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


serving, that he that chose :first took her that was 
reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the five, 
which made mirth enough among the rest , and even 
the Spaniards laughed at it. But the fellow con- 
sidered better than any of them, that it was ap- 
plication and business that they were to expect 
assistance in as much as anything else , and she 
proved the hest wife of all the pan-el. 

When the poor women saw thcmsches set in a 
row thus, and fetched out one by one, the terroi-s of 
their condition leturned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed that they were now a-going to be 
devoured. Accoidiiigly, when the English sailor 
came in and fetched’ out one of them, the rest set 
up a most lamentable cij, and hung about liei, and 
took their leave of her with siiih agonies and such 
affection as w'ould have giieved the haidest heait in 
the world ; nor was it possible foi the Englislimen 
to satisfy them that they were not to be immediately 
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Fridays 
fathei, who immediately let them know that the live 
men who had fetched them out one by one had 
chosen them for their wives 

When they had done, and the fnght the w omen 
were in was a little over, the men went to work, and 
the Spaniards came and hcl[K-d tliem , and in a few 
hours tliey had built them every one a new hut or 
tent for their lodging apirt , foi those they had 
already were crowded with their tools, household 
stuff, and provision. The three wicked ones had 

I iitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, 
lut both on the north shoie of the island, so that 
they continued separate ns before ; and thus my 
island was peopled m three places, and, as I might 
say, three towns were begun to be planted 

And here ’tis very well worth observing that as 
it often happens in the world (what the wise ends of 
[ 78 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

God’s providence are in such a disposition of things 
I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two 
worst wives , and the three reprobates, that were 
scai’ce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and 
neither seemed born to do themselves good, or any 
one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and in- 
genious wives, not that the two fust were ill wives 
as to their temper or humour, for all the five were 
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjective creatures, 
rather like slaves than wives ; but my meaning is, 
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or indus- 
trious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honour 
of a diligent application on one hand, and to the 
disgiace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the 
other, that when I came to the place and viewed 
the several improvements, plantings, and manage- 
ment of tlic several little colonies, the two men had 
so far outgone the three, that there was no com- 
parison 'I'liey had indeed both of them as much 
ground laid out for com as they wanted, and the 
reason was, because, according to my rule. Nature 
dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn 
than they wanted , but the difference of the cultiva- 
tion, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed of 
everything else, was easy to lie seen at first view 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
about their huts, that when jou tame to the place 
nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and though 
they had twice had their plantations demolished, 
once by their own countrymen, and once by the 
enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they had 
restored all again, and everything was thriving and 
fiourishmg about them. They had grapes planted 
m order, and managed like a vineyard, though they 
had thcm.selves never seen anything of that kmd , 
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes 
[ 79 ]

were as good again as any of the others. They had 
also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest 
part of the woods, where, though there was not a 
natural cave, as I had found. Vet they made one 
with incessant labour of their hands, and where, 
when the mischief which followed happened, they 
secured their wi\es and children, so as they could 
never be found , they having, by sticking iiinunier- 
able stakes and poles of the wood which, as I said, 
giew so easily, mode the wood unpassable except in 
some places, where they climbed up to get over the 
outside part, and then went on Dy ways of their 
own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, 
though they were much civilised by their new settle- 
ment compared to what they were before, and were 
not so <iuarrelsoiiie, having not the same oppor- 
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a profli- 
gate mind ne\er left them, and that was their 
idlcn'css. It IS tine, they [ilanted corn and made 
fences ; but Solomon’s w'ords w ere novel better veri- 
fied than in them “ I went by the vineyard of the 
slothful, and it was all overgiown with thorns for 
when the Spaniaids came to view their crop, they 
could not see it in some places for weeds , the hedge 
had seveial gaps in it, wheie the wild goats had 
gotten in aiul eaten up the corn , perhaps here and 
there a dead bush was craiinned in to stop them out 
for the present, but it was only shutting the stable 
door aftc'r the steed was stolen Whereas, when 
they looked on the colony of the other two, there 
was the very face of industry and success upon all 
they did, there was not a weed to be seen in all 
their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges ; and they, 
on the other hand, verified Solomon’s words in 
another place That the diligent hand maketh 
rich,” foi everything grew and thrived, and they 
[ 80 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

had plenty within and without ; they had more tame 
cattle than the other, more utensils and necessaries 
i^ithin doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion 
too 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors ; and having learned the 
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of 
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was cook’s 
mate on Ijoard the ship, tliey chessed their husbands' 
victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the other 
could not be brought to understand it ; but then the 
husband, who, as I say, had been cook’s mate, did it 
himself. But as for the husliands of the three wives, 
they loitered about, fetched turtles’ eggs, and caught 
fish and birds ; in a word, anything but labour, and 
they fared accordingl) 'ITie diligent lived well and 
coinfortahly, and the slothful lived hard and beg- 
garly , and so I believe, generally speaking, it is wl 
ovei the world. 

But now I come to a scene different from all that 
had hapjiened befoie, either to them oi to me ; and 
the ongiiial of the story was this. 

Early one iiioining flicre came on shore five or six 
canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which you 
please; and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 
slaves. But that part was now so familiar to the 
Spaniaids, and to our men too, that they did not 
concern themselves about it, as I did ; but having 
been made sensible by their experience that their 
only business was to he concealed, and that, if they 
were not seen by any of the savages, they would go 
off again ijuietly when their business wns done, 
having as yet not the least notion of there being aiw 
inhabitants in the island ; I say, having been made 
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give 
notice to all the three plantations to keep within 
voi. 11 . — 6 [ 81 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


doors, and not show thoinseUes, only placing a scout 
in a proper place to give notice when the boats went 
to sea again 

This was, without doubt, very right, but a dis- 
aster spoiled all tliesc measures, and made it known 
among the savages that there were inhabitants there, 
which w'as, in the end, the desolation of almost the 
whole colony. After the canoes with the savages 
were gone off, the Spaniai-ds peeped abroad again, 
and some of them had the curiosity to go to the 
place where they had been, to see what they had 
Dccii doing Here, to their great surpnse, they 
found thiee savages left behind, and lying fast 
asleep upon the ground It was supposed they had 
either been so gorged with their inhuman feast that, 
like beasts, they wcixj asleep, and would not stir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the 
woods, and did not come back ni tunc to be taken in. 

Thji Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, 
and jierfectly at a loss what to do ITic Spaniard 
governor, as it happened, was with them, and his 
advice was asked , but he piofessed he knew not 
what to do As for slaves, they had enough already , 
and as to killing them, they were none of them in- 
clined to that The Spaniard governor told me 
they could not think of shedding innocent blood , 
for as to them, the poor creatures had done them 
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they 
thought they had no just quarrel against them to 
take away their lives. 

And hcie I must, in justice to these Spaniards, 
observe, tliat let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in 
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met 
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any 
foreign countiy, who were so universally modest, 
temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so 
courteous as these Spaniards , and as to cruelty, they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had nothing of it in their very nature ; no inhuman- 
ity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and yet 
all of them men of great courage and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their 
beainiig the insufferable u.sage of the thiee Englisli- 
men , and their justice and humanity appeared now 
in the case of the savages, as above. After some 
consultation they resolved u|)oii this, that they would 
lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three 
men might lie gone, but then the governor Spaniaid 
recollected that the thiee savages had no boat, and 
that if they were left to rove about the island, they 
would certainly discover that theie were inhabitants 
111 it, and so they should be undone that way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fast asleep still . so they resolved to 
waken them, and take them prisoners, and they did 
so, The poor fellows were stiangely flighted when 
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like 
the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten ; for it seems those people think all the world 
doas a.s they do, eating men’s flesh ; but they weie 
soon made easy as to that, and away they carried 
them 

It was veiy happy to them that they did not 
carry them home to their castle , I mean, to iiiy 
palace under the hill , but they carried them first to 
the bower, where was the chief of their country 
work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the com, fkc , and afteiw irds they carried them to 
the habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it w'as not 
much they had for them to do , and whether it 
was bv negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I 
know not, but one of them ran away, and taking 
into the woods, they could never hear of him more. 
[ 83 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

They had good reason to believe he got home 
again soon aftei, in some other boats or canoes of 
savages, who came on shore thi'ee or four weeks 
afterwards, and who, cairying on their revels as 
usual, went off again in two days’ time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly , for they con- 
cluded, and that not without good cause indeed, 
that if this fellow came vife home among his com- 
rades, he would certainly give them an account that 
there were people in the island, as tflso how few and 
weak they were ; for this savage, as I observed be- 
fore, had never been told, and it was very hajipy he 
had not, how many thei'e were, or where they lived, 
nor had he ever seen or he.aid the fire of any of their 
guns, much less liad thc'y shown him any of their 
other retired places fsiK’b as the cave in the valley, 
or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had 
made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that about two 
months after this six canoes of savages, with about 
seven or eight or ten men in a canoe, came lowing 
along the north side of the island, where they never 
used to come before, and landed about an hour after 
sunrise at a convenient place, about a mile from the 
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this es- 
caped man had been kept. As the Spaniard gov- 
eriioi said, had they been all there the diimage would 
not have been so much, for not a man of them 
would have escajied , but the case differed now very 
much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. 
The two men had the happiness to discover them 
about a league off, so that it was above an hour be- 
fore they landed, and as they landc'd a mile from 
their huts, it was some time before they could come 
at them. Now having great reason to believe that 
they were betrayed, the first thing they did was to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two 
of the three men whom they brought with the 
women, who, it seems, proved very faithful to them, 
to lead them with their two wives, and whatever 
they could carry away with them, to tlieir retired 
place in the woods, which I have spoken of above, 
and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till 
they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all 
come on shore, and that they bent their course di- 
rectly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav- 
ing their goats to straggle into the woods whither 
they pleased, tliat the savages might think they 
were all bred wild ; but the logue who came with 
them was too cunning for that, and gave them an 
account of it all, for they went directly to the 
place. 

When the two poor frighted men had secured 
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave they 
had of the three who came with the women, and 
who was at their place by accident, away to the 
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, 
and desire .speedy help , and in the meantime they 
took their arms, and what ammunition they had, 
and retreated towards the place in the wood where 
their wives weix? sent, keeping at a distance, yet so 
that they might see, if possible, which way the sav- 
ages took. 

They had not gone far but that, from a rising 
ground, they could see the little aermy of their ene- 
mies come on diiiectly to their habitation, and in a 
moment 0101% could .see all their huts and household 
stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification ; for they had a very great loss, to 
them irretrievable, at least for some time. They 
kept their station for a while till they found the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over 
the place, ruiiiniaguig every way, and every place 
they could think of, in search for prey, and in par- 
ticular for the peojile, of whom it now plainly ap- 
peared they had intelligence. 

The two Englishtrieii seeing this, thinking them- 
selves not secure where they stood, because as it w as 
likely some of the wild people might come that way, 
so uiey might come too many together, thought 
it proper tii make another retreat about half a 
mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, 
that the farther they sti oiled the fewer would be 
together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick grown pait of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tice stood, which was hollow, and vastly 
large ; and in tins tree they both took their stand- 
ing, resolving to .sec there what might offer. 

They had not stood there long, but two of the 
savages appealed lunning directly that way, a.s if 
they hiul already had notice where they stood, and 
were coining up to attack them , and a little way 
farthei they spied three more coining after them, 
and file more beyond them, all coming the same 
wai , besides w hich thev saw seven or eight more at 
a distance lunning another way , for in a word, they 
ran eieiy way, like sportsmen beating for their 
game 

T'he poor men weie now in great perplexity whether 
they should stand and keep their posture, or fly , but 
after a veiy shoit deb<ite with themselves, they con- 
sidered, tliat if the savages ranged the country thus 
before help came, they might, perhaps, find out their 
retreat in the woods, then all would be lost ; so they 
resolved to stand them there ; and if they were too 
many to deal with, then they would get up to the 
top of the tree, from whence they doubted not to 
[ 86 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


• 

defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their 
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were 
landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having resolved ujion this, they next c-onsidered 
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for 
the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two and the five that followed would oe sepa- 
rated, and they resolved to let the two first pass 
by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and 
come to attack them. The two firet savages also 
confirmed them in this regulation, by turning a little 
fiom them towards another part of the wood , but 
the tliree, and tlic five after them, came forwards 
directly to the tree, as if they had known the En- 
glishmen were there 

Seeing them come so .straight towartls them, they 
resolved fo take them in a line as they came; and as 
tliey resolved to fire but one at a tune, perhaps the 
first shot might hit them all three , to which pur- 
pose the man who wa.s to fire put three or four 
small bullets into Ins piece, and having a fair loop- 
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the ti-ee, he 
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till 
they were within about thirty yards of the tiee, so 
that he could not iiii.ss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages 
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was 
the runaway savage that had escaped from them, 
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved 
tliat, if possible, he should not escnjie, though they 
should both file , so the other stood ready with his 
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he 
should be sure to have a second. 

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his 
aim , for as the savages kept near one another, a 
little behind in a line, in a woid, he fired, and hit 
two of them directly. The forenjo.st was killed out- 

[ 87 ] 



flOBINSON'dKUSOE 


right, being shot in the head; the second, which 
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, 
and fell, but was nut quite dead ; and the third had 
a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same 
ball that went through the body of tne second ; and 
being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, 
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling 
in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noise than sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; 
for the woods made the sound a thousand times 
bigger than it really was, the iichoes rattling from 
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 

f arts, screaming and making, every sort, a several 
ind of noise, accoixlmg to their kind ; just as it 
was when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was 
ever shot off in that place since it was an island 
However, all being silent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, 
till'they came to the place where their companions 
lay in a condition miserable enough ; and here the 
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were 
within rciu'h of the same mischief, stood all of a 
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may 
be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be 
hurt , and who, 't is veiy rational to Ix^heve, told 
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after 
that thunder from their gods, had killed two, and 
wounded him. This, I say, is rational ; for nothing 
is more certain than that, as they saw no man near 
them, so they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or so much as heard of a gun ; neither knew 
they anything of killing or wounding at a distance 
with fire and bullehs. If they had, one might reason- 
ably believe they would not have stood so uncon- 
cerned in viewing the fate of their fellows without 
some apprehension of their own. 

[ 88 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Our two men, though, a.s they confes^ed to me, it 
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor 
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of 
their dan^r ; yet having them all thus in their 
power, and the first having loaded his piece again, 
resolved to let fly both together among them, and 
singling out, by agi-eement, winch to aim at, they 
shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, 
four of them ; the fifth, frighted e\en to death, 
though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our men, 
seeing them all fall together, thought they had 
killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong step, and they were under some surprise when 
they came to the place and found no less than four 
of the men alive, and of them two very little hurt, 
and one not at all. This obliged them to fall upon 
them with the stocks of their muskets; and first they 
made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the 
cause of all the mischief, and of another that was 
hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. 
Then the man that was not hurt at all came and 
kneeled down to them with his two hands held up, 
and made piteous moans to them by gestures and 
signs for his life, but could not say one word to 
them that they could understand. 

However, they signed to him to sit down at the 
foot of a tree thereby , and one of the Englishmen, 
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his two feet fast together, 
and his two hands behind him, and there they left him, 
and with what speed they could made after the other 
two which were gone before, feanng they, or any 
more of them, should find the way to their covered 
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few 
[ 89 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight 
of the two men, hut it was at a great distance. 
However, they had the satisfaction to see them croas 
over a valley towards the sea, the quite conti’ary way 
from that which led to their retreat, which they 
were afraid of, and being satisfied with that, they 
went back to the tree where they left their prisoner, 
who, as they supposed, was deliveml by nis com- 
rades ; for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope- 
yarn with which they bound him lay just at the foot 
of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not 
knowing what couise to take, or how near the enemy 
might be, or in what numbers ; so they resolved to 
go away to the place where their wives were, to see 
if all was well there, and to make them easy, who 
were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the 
savages were their ow n country-folk, yet they were 
most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more 
for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages 
had been in the wood, and very near that place, but 
had not found it ; for it was indeed inaccessible, by 
the trees standing so thick, as before, had not the 
pei-sons seeking it been directed by those that knew 
it, which these did not They found, therefore, 
everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 
fright While they were here they had the comfort 
to have seven of the Spaniaids come to their a.ssist- 
ance , the other ten, with their servants and old 
Friday, I mean Friday’s father, were gone in a body 
to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that 
was kept there, in case the savages should have 
roved over to that side of the country ; but they did 
not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came 
one of the three savage.s, who, as I said, were their 
prisoners formerly, and with them also came the 
[ 90 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


savage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand 
and foot at the tree ; for it seems they came that 
way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and un- 
bound the eighth, and brought him along with them, 
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, 
as they had the two others, who were left when the 
third ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them, 
and tliej’ were so afraid of their escaping, that they 
were once resolving to kill them all, believing they 
were under an absolute necessity to do so for their 
own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor 
would not consent to it, but oidered tor the present 
that they should be sent out of the way to iny old 
cave in the \ alley, and be kept there, with tw'o 
Spaniards to guard them and give them food for 
their subsistence, which was done; and they were 
bound there hand and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen 
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy 
themselves to stay any loiigei there ; but taking five 
of the Spaniards, and theiiisehes, with four muskets 
and a pistol among theiii, and t«'o stout quarter- 
staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first, they came to the tree where the men lay 
that had been killed; but it was easy to see that 
some more of the savages had been there , for they 
had attempted to carry their dead men away, and 
had dragged two of them u good way, but had gii cn 
it over. From thence they advanced to the first 
rising ground, where they stood and saw their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still 
to see some of the smoke; but neither could they 
here see any of the savages. They then resolveti, 
though with all possible caution, to go forward 
towards their ruined plantation , but a little before 
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, 
[ 91 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They seemed sorry at first, and there was no v ay to 
come at them to give them a parting blow ; but upon 
the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, 
and all their improvement destniyed, the rest all 
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to 
assist them with needful supplies. Their three 
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the 
least inclination to any good, yet as soon as they 
heard of it (for they, living remote eastwai-d, knew 
nothing of the matter till all was over), came and 
offered their help and assistance, and did very 
friendly work for several days to restore their habi- 
tation, and make necessaries for them ; and thus in 
a little time they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this they had the further 
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes 
come driving on shore, and at some distance from 
them, two drew ned men ; by which they had reason 
to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, 
and had overset some of them, for it had blown 
ve^ hard the very night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so on the other 
hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as 
well of what they had done, as of what had hap- 
pened to them, and to whet them on to another en- 
terprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, 
resolved to attempt, with sufficient forc-e to carry all 
before them ; for except what the first man had told 
them of inhabitants, they could say little to it of 
their own knowledge, for they never saw one man ; 
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, 
th^ had no other witness to confirm it to them. 

It was five or six luuiiths after this before they 
heard any more of the savages, in which time our 
[ 92 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


men were in hopes they had either foi^t their 
former bad luck, or ipven over the hopes of better, 
when on a sudden they were invaded with the most 
formidable fleet of no less than eight and twenty 
canoes, full of savages, arniefl with bows and an'ows, 
great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of 
war ; and they brought such numbers with them, 
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost 
consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the 
easternmost side of the island, our men had that 
night to consult and consider what to do ; and in 
the first place, knowing that their being entirely 
.concealed was their only safety before, and would 
much more be so now while the number of their ene- 
mies was so great, they therefore resolved, first of 
all, to take down the huts which were built for the 
two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the 
old cave ; because they supposed the savages would 
go directly thither as soon as it was day to play the 
old game over again, though they did not now land 
within two leagues of it. 

In the next place, they drove away all the flock of 
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which 
belonged to the Spaniards, and, in short, left as 
little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was 
possible; and the next morning early they pasted 
themselves with all their force at the plantation of 
the two men, waiting for their coming. As they 
guessed, so it happened. These new' invaders, leav- 
ing their canoes at the east end of the island, came 
ranging along the shore, directly towards the place, 
to the number of 250, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but that 
which was worse, they had not arms for all their 
number neither. The whole account, it seems, 
stood thus. First, as to the men : —

5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken by 
me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced. 

2 Swords 

S Old halberds 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or 
iiisee, but they had every one a halberd, or a long 
staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron 
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a 
hatchet ; also every one of our men had hatchets 
Tw'o of the women could not be prevailed upon but 
they would come info the fight, and they had bows 
and. arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the 
savages when the fiiwt action hapfiened, which I 
have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one 
another, and the women had hatchets too. 

Tile Spaniard goveinor, whom I have described so 
often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins, 
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was 
a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. 
Tlie savages came forwanl like lions, and our men, 
which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage 
in their situation ; only that Will Atkins, who now 
proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was 
planted just behind a small thicket of hushes, as an 
advanced guard, with oiders to let the first of them

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


pass by, and then fire into the middle of them, and 
as soon as he had fired to make his retreat, as nimbly 
as he could, round a part of the wood, and so come 
in behind the Spaniards wheie they stood, having 
a thicket of trees also before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling 
about every waj iii heaps, out of all manner of 
order, and William Atkins let about fifty of them 
pass by him ; then seeing the rest come in a very 
thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire, 
having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets 
apiece, about as big as large pistol-bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not; but 
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages. They were frighted to the last 
degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their 
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that 
did it. When in the middle of their fright V^illiam 
Atkins and his other three let fly again among the 
thickest of them, and in less than a minute the first 
three, being loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had William Atkins ana his men letiretl immedi- 
ately as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered 
to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand to 
have poui-ed in their shot continually, the savages 
had been effectually routed ; for the terror that was 
among them came principally from this, via, that 
they were killed by the gods with thunder and 
lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. 
But william Atkins, staying to load again, dis- 
covered the cheat. Some of the savages, who were 
at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind ; 
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, 
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir- 
ing as fast ns they could, yet they wounded Atkins 
himself, and killed one of his rellow Englishmen 
with their arrows, as they did afterwai'ds one Span- 
[ 96 ]

iard and one of the Indian slaves who came with 
the women. This slave was a nio'«t gallant fellow, 
and fought most desperately, killing five of them 
with his own hand, having no weajion but one of 
the armed staves and a hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded 
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground 
in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after bring three 
volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their numher 
was so great, and they were so desperate, that though 
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so 
many wounded, yet they <»me on in the teeth of our 
men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a 
cloud , and it was observed that their wounded men, 
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous 
by their wounds, and fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englishman that was killed behind them ; 
and the savages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking their 
arms, legs, and heads with their clubs and wooden 
swords, hke true savages. But finding our men weie 
gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew 
themselves up in a kind of a ring, which is, it seems, 
their custom, and shouted twice in token of their 
victory ; after w'hich, they had the mortification to 
see several of their wounded men fall, dying with the 
mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, 
though he was wounded, would have bad him marcbecl 
and charged them again altogether at once. But 
the Spaniard replied, “ Seignior Atkins, you see how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morn- 
ing ; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore 
with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, 
and BO we shall have the fewer to engage." 

[961 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied 
merrilv, “That’s true, Seignior, and so shall I too ; 
and that’s the reason 1 would go on while I am 
warm.” “ Well, Seignior Atkins,” says the Spaniard, 
“ you have behaved gallantly, and done your part , 
we will light for you if you cannot come on, but I 
think it best to stay till morning.” So th^ waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they 
found the savages in great disorder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise 
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved 
to faU upon them in the night, especially if they 
could come to give them but one volley before they 
were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity 
to do , for one of the two Englishmen, in whose 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round 
between the woods and seaside westward, and then 
turning short south they came so near where the 
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or 
heanl eight of them fii-ed in among them, and did 
dreadful execution upon them. In half a minute 
more eight others firm after them, pouring in their 
small shot in such a quantity, that abundance were 
killed and wounded ; and all this while they were not 
able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

'The Spaniards charged again with the utmost 
expedition, and then divided themselves into thi'ee 
bodies, and resolved to full in among them altogether. 
They had in each body eight persons ; that is to say, 
twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men and the 
two women, who, by the way, foyght desperately. 

They divided the firearms equally in each party, 
and so of the halberds and staves. They would have 
had the women keep back, but they said they were 
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus 
formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the 

TOIi. II. — 7 I ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. 
'Fhe savages stood all together, but were in the 
utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shout- 
ing from three quarters together , they would have 
fought if they had seen us ; and as soon as we came near 
enough to be seen, some anows were shut, and poor 
old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously. 
But our men gave them no time, but running up to 
them tired among them three ways, and then fell in 
with the butt ends of their muskets, their swords, 
armed staves, and hatchets ; and laid about them so 
well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming 
and howling, flying to save their lives which way so- 
ever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about 
one hundred and eighty of them. The rest, being 
flighted out of their wite, scoured through the woods 
ana over the hills, with all the speed and fear that 
nimble feet could help them to do, and as we did 
not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got 
all together to the seaside, where they landed, and 
where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not 
at an end yet, for it blew a ten ible storm of w'ind 
that eicning from the seaward, so that it was im- 
possible for them to go off, nay, the storm con- 
tinuing all night, when the tide came up their canoes 
were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so 
high upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to 
get them oft'; and some of them were even dashed 
to pieces against the beach, or against one another. 

Our men, thougfi glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night ; but having refreshed them- 
selves as well as they could, they re.solved to march 
to that {lart of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This 
necessaidly led them over the place where the fight 
[ 98 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


had been, and where they found several of the poor 
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering 
life ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds ; 
for a truly gi-eat man, though obliged by the law of 
battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his 
misery. However, there «as no need to give any 
orders in this case ; for their own savages, who were 
their servants, despatched those poor creatures with 
their hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miserable remains of the savages' army lay, 
where there appeared about a hundred still; there 
posture was geiieially sitting upon the ground, with 
their knees up towards their mouth, and the head 
put between the two hands, leaning down upon the 
knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shot of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to 
be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, 
that by their countenance he might know what to 
expect, viz., whether they w’ere still in heart to fight, 
or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and 
discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took ; for os soon as the savages 
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, 
they started up from their feet in the greatest con- 
sternation imaginable; and as our men advanced 
swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which 
our men did not understand, and had never heard 
before; and thus they ran up the hills into the 
country. 

At Aret, our men had much rather the weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea ; but 
they did not then consider that this might probably 
have been the ‘occasion of their coming again in such 
multitudes as not to be resisted ; or, at least, to come 

[ 99 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


80 many, and so often, as would quite desolate the 
island and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, 
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, 
proved the best counsellor in this case. His advice 
was, to take the advantage that offered, and clap in 
between them and their boats, and so deprive them 
of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague 
the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were 
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly to the 
woods, and live there desperate , and so they should 
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afreid to stir 
out about their business, and have their plantations 
continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do 
with a hundred men, than with a hundred natiohs ; 
that as they must destroy their boats, so they must 
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them- 
selves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of 
it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they 
went to work immediately with the boats, and get- 
ting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they 
triM to set some of them on fire ; but they were so 
wet that they would not burn. However, the fire 
so burned the upper part, that it soon made them 
unfit for swimming in the .sea as boats. When the 
Indians saw what they were about, some of them 
came running out of the woods, and coming as near 
as they could to our men, kneeled down and cined, 
Oa, Ooy Waramdka, and some other words of their 
language, which none of the others understood any- 
thing of ; but as they made pitiful gestures and 
strange noises, it was easy to understand they 
begged to have their boats spared, and that they 
would be gone, and never come theie again. 

But our men w’ere now satisfied, that they had no 

[* 100 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


way to preserve themselves or to save their colony, 
but effectually to prevent any of these people from 
ever going home again, depending upon this, that 
if ever so much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the story, the colony was undone. 
So that letting them know that they should not 
have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, 
and destroyed them, every one that the storm had 
not destroyed before , at the sight of which the 
savages raised a hideous ei*y in the woods, which our 
people heard plain enough, after which they ran 
about the island like distracted men ; so that, in a 
w’ord, our men did not I'eally know at first what to 
do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, 
consider that while they made those people thus 
dc.speratc, they ought to have kept good guard at 
the same time upon their plantations; for though 
it is true they had driven away their cattle, and the 
Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean 
my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, 
yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and 
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant- 
ing about it , trM all the com under foot ; tore up 
the vines and gi'apes, being just then almost ripe, 
and did to our men an inestimable damage, though 
to themselves not one farthing worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon 
all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue 
them, or hunt them up or down ; for as they were 
too nimble of foot for our men when they found them 
single, so our men durst not go about single for fear 
of TOing sin rounded with their numbei's. The best 
was, they had no weapons ; for though they had bows, 
they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any, 
nor had they any edged tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to 

[ 101 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same 
time our men were also brought to very bad circum- 
stances by them ; for though their retreats were pre- 
served, yet their provision was destioycd, and their 
harvest spoiled , and what to do, or which way to 
turn themselves, they knew not. The only refuge 
they had now was the stock of cattle they had in 
the valley by the cave, and some little corn which 
grew there ; and the plantation of the three English- 
men, William Atkins and his comrades, who were 
now reduced to two, one of them being killed by an 
arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, 
just under the temple, so that he never spoke more ; 
and it was very remarkable, that this was the same 
barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with 
his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have 
murdcied all the Spaniards 

I looked upon this case to have been worse at this 
time than mine was at any time after I first dis- 
covered the grains of barley and rice, and got into 
the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I maj say, a hun- 
dred wolves upon the island, which would devour 
everything they could come at, yet rtnild very hardly 
be come at themselves. 

The fii-st thing they concluded when they saw 
what their circumstances were, was that they would, 
if possible, drive them up to the farther part of the 
island, south-west, that if any more savages came on 
shore, they might not find one another , then that 
they would daily hunt and haiass them, and kill as 
many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their number ; and if they could at last tame 
them, and hriiig them to anything, they would give 
them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live 
upon their daily labour 

In order to this they so followed them, and so 

[ 102 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


temfied them with their guns, that in a few days, 
if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for fear; and so 
dieadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of 
sight farther and farther, till at last our men follow- 
ing them, and every day almost killing and wound- 
ing some of them, they kept up in the woods and 
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the 
utmost misery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hui’t, but merely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts re- 
lent, and pity moved them; especially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous- 
minded man that ever I met with in my life ; and he 

E roposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and 
ling him to underitand what they meant, so far as 
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among 
them, and see if they might lie brought to some con- 
ditions that might lie depended ujwn, to save their 
live-., and to do us no sfioil 

It was some while before any of them could be 
taken , but being weak and half-starved, one of them 
was at last surpiised, and made a prisoner. He was 
sullen at first, and would neither eat or drink ; but 
finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him, 
and no violence offered him, heat last grew trot'table, 
and came to himself'. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the others would 
l)c to them all , that they would not only save their 
lives, but would give them a part of the island to 
live in, provided they would give satisfaction that 
they would keep in their own bounds, and not come 
beyond it, to injure or prejudice others ; and that 
they should have corn given them to plant and make 
it grow for their bread, and some bread given them 

[ 103 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


their present subsistence ; and old Friday bade 
the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countiy- 
men, and see what they said to it, assuring them that 
if they did not agree immediately they should be all 
destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with 
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have 
some food given them ; upon which twdvc Spaniards 
and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian 
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where 
they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a 
large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes, 
and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they 
were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they 
sat down, ate the provisions very thankfiilly, and 
were the most faithful fellows to their words that 
could be thought of, for except when they came 
to beg victuals and directions, they never came out 
of their bounds ; and there they lived when I came 
to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant com, make 
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they 
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would have 
been a nation. They were confined to a neck of 
land surrounded with high rocks behind them, and 
lying plain towards the sea before them, on the 
south-east comer of the island They had land 
enough, and it was veiy good and fmitful ; they 
had a piece of land about a mile and half broad, 
and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, 
such as I made for myself ; and gave them among 
them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives ; 
and there they lived, the most subjected innocent 
creatures that ever were heaid of. 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity 
[ 104 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


with respect to the savages till I came to revisit 
them, which was above two years ; not but that now 
and then some canoes of savages came on shore for 
their triumphal unnatural feasts ; but as they were 
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of 
those that came before, or the reason of it, they did 
not make any search or inquiry after their country- 
men ; and if they had, it would have been very hard 
to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all 
that happened to them to my return, at least that 
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were 
wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any of the Indians coming to them, because they 
would not have their settlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, 
but they soon outdid their masters ; for they made 
abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work ; 
particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, 
cupboards, &c., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things, being very 
ingenious at such work when they were once put in 
the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, 
because we furnished them with knives, scissors, 
spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind 
which they could want. 

With the help of these tools they were so very 
handy, that they came at last to build up their huts, 
or houses, very handsomely ; raddling, or working it 
up like basket-work all the way round, which was a 
very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd ; but was an exceeding good fence, as well 
against heat as against all sorts of vermin ; and our 
men were so taken with it, that they got the wild 
[ 106 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Havages to come and do the like for them ; so that 
when I came to see the two Englishmen’s colonies, 
they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like 
bees in a hive. And as for Will Atkins, who was 
now become a very industrious, necessai y, and sober 
fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket- 
work as I belic\e was never seen. It was one hun- 
dred and twenty paces round in the outside, as I 
measured by my steps, the walls were as close 
worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty - 
two in number, and very strong, standing about 
seven feet high. In the middle was another, not 
above twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, 
being eight-square in its form, and in the eight 
comers stood eight very strong posts, round the top 
of which he laid stiong piw'es. pinned together with 
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for the 
roof of eight rafters, very handsome I assure you, 
and joined together veiy well, though he had no 
nails, and only a few m>n spikes, which he made 
himself too out of the old non that I had left thcic , 
and indeed this fellow showed abundance of inge- 
nuity in seveial things which be had no knowledge 
of. He mode him a foige, with a pan of wooden 
bellows to blow the fire , he made liiniself chawoal 
for bis work, and he formed out of one of the non 
crows a middling gcaid anvil to hiimmei upon , in 
this manner he made many things, but especially 
hooks, staples, and spikes, Ixilts and hinges. But 
to letuiii to the house, after he hiul pitched the 
roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between 
the rafters with basket-woik, so linn, and thatched 
that over again so ingeniously with ric-e-straw. and 
over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the 
top, that his house was as diy as if it had been tiled 
or slated. Indeed, he owned that the savages made 
the basket-work for him. 

[ 106 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all 
round this inner apartment, and long'rafters lay from 
the two and thirty angle*, to the top of the posts of 
the inner house, being about twenty feet distance , so 
that there was a space like a walk within the outer 
wieker wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet 
wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into 
six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a door, 
and out of eveiy one of these there was a door : first, 
into the entry, or coining into the main tent ; and 
another door into the space or walk that was round 
it ; so that walk was also divided into six equal parts, 
which served not only for retreat, but to store up 
any necessaries which the family had occasion for. 
These six spaces not taking up the whole circum- 
ference, what other apartments the outer circle had, 
were thus ordered as soon as you were in at the 
door of the outer circle, you had a short passage 
straight before you to the dooi of the inner house ; 
but on either side was a wicker pai tition, and a door 
111 it, by which you went first into a large room or 
store-house, twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet 
long, and through that into another not quite so 
long , so that iii the outer circle was ten handsome 
rooms, six of which were only to be come at through 
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets 
or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the 
inner circle, and four large warehouses or barns, 
or what you please to call them, which went in 
through one another, two on either hand of the 
passage, that led through the outer door to the 
inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never 
seen in the w'orld ; nor a house or tent so neatly con- 
trived, much less so built. In this great beehive 
[ 107 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


lived the thive families , that is to say, Will Atkins 
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his 
wife remained with three children , for she was, it 
seems, big with child when he died, and the other 
two were not at all backward to gKe the widow her 
full share of everything, I mean as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or 
found a turtle on the shore ; so that they all lived 
well enough, though it war true they were not so 
industrious as the other two, as has been observed 
already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that 
IS for religion, I don't know that there was anything 
of that kind among them. They pretty often indeed 
put one another in mind that there was a God by 
the very common method of seamen, viz., swearing 
by His name , nor were their poor, ignorant, savage 
wives much the better for having been married to 
Christians, as we must call them , for as they knew 
very little of God themselves, so they were utterly 
incapable of entering into any discourse with their 
wives about a God, or to talk anything to them con- 
ceniing religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can 
say the wives had made from them was, that they 
had taught them to speak English pretty well ; and 
all the children they had, which were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak, though they at hrst spoke it 
in a veiy broken mannci, like their mothers. There 
were none of these children above six years old when 
I came thither , for it was not much above seven 
years that they had fetched these live savage ladies 
over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they 
had all children, more or less. I think the cook's 
mate's wife was big of her sixth child ; and the 
mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet, 
[ 108 ] 



HOBINSON CKUSOE 


laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to 
one another, mighty ob»iervant and subject to their 
masters, I cannot call them husbands ; and wanted 
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian 
religion, and to be legally married , both which were 
happily bi ought about afterwai-ds by my means, 
or at least in consequence of my coming among 
them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of in> five runagate English- 
men, I must say something of tlie Spaniards, who 
were the main body of the family, and in whose story 
there are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discounes with them about 
their circumstances when they were among the 
savages. They told me readily, that they had no 
instances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country; that they were a poor, miseiable, de- 
jected handful of people ; that if means had been 
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned 
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight 
of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing 
but starving. One of them, a grave and very sen- 
sible man, told me he was convinced they were in 
the wrong , that it was not the part of wise men to 
give up thein.selves to their misery, but always to 
take hold of the helps which reason offered, as well 
for present support, as for future deliverance. He 
told me that grief was the most senseless insignificant 
passion 111 the world ; for that it legaided only things 
past, which was generally impossible to be recalled 
or to be remedied, but nad no views to things to 
come, and had no share in anything that looked like 
deliverance, but rather added to the affliction than 
proposed a remedy ; and upon this he repeated a 
Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat in 
just the same words that he spoke in, yet I remember 

[1091 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I made it into an English proverb of my own, 
thus • 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little im- 
provements I had made in my solitude , my unwearied 
application, ns he called it, and how I had made a 
condition, which in its circumstances was at fii'st 
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more 
happy than theirs was even now% when they were 
all together. He told me it was remarkable that 
Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their 
distress than any people that ever he met with , 
that their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were 
the worst men in the world to struggle with mis- 
fortunes , for their first step in dangers, after the 
common efforts are o\cr, was always to despair, lie 
down under it and die, without lousing their thoughts 
up to moper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceed- 
ingly , that they wcie cast upon the shore without 
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present 
sustenance, till they could provide , that it is true I 
had this disadvantage and discomfoi't, that I w'as 
alone , but then the supplies I had providentially 
thrown into my hands by the unexpected driving of 
the ship on shore, was such a help, as would have 
encouraged any creature in the woild to have ap- 
plied himself as I had done. “ Seignior,” says the 
Spaniai'd, “ had we pooi Spaniards been in your 
case, we should never have gotten half those things 
out of the ship as you did ; nay,” says he, “ we 
should never have niund^ means to have gotten a 
raft to carry them, or to have gotten the raft on 
shore without boat or .sail ; and how much less 
ihould we have done,” said he, “ if any of us had 
[ 110 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

been alone?" Well, I desired him to abate his 
compliment, and go on with the history of their 
coining on shore, where they landed. He told me 
they unhappily landed at a place where there were 
j)eople without provisions ; whereas, had they had the 
common sense to have put oif to sea again, and 
gone to another island a little farther, they had 
found provisroiis, though without people ; there be- 
ing an island that way, as they had been told, where 
there was pro vi ,10ns, though no people : that is to 
say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently 
been there, and had filled the island with goats and 
hogs at several times, where they had bred in such 
multitudes, and where turtle and sea- fowls were in 
such plenty, that they could have been in no want 
of flesh though they had found no bread ; whereas 
here they were only sustained w'lth a few roots and 
herbs which they understood not, and which had no 
substance 111 them, and winch the inhabitants gave 
them sparingly enough, and who could treat them no 
better unless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's 
flesh, which was the gi-eat daintv of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
strove to civilise the savages they were with, and to 
teach them rational customs in the oidina^ way of 
living, but in vain , and how they retorted it upon 
them as unjust, that they, who came there for assist- 
ance and support, should attempt to set up for in- 
structors of those that gave them bread ; intimating, 
it seems, that none should set up for the instructors 
of others but those who could live without them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how sometimes they were 
many ways without aiijr food at all, the island they 
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that 
lived more indolent, and for that reason were less 
supplied with the necessaries of life than they had 
[lllj 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


reaBon to believe others were in the same part of 
the world ; and yet they found that these savages 
were less ravenous and voracious than those who hud 
better supplies of food. 

Also they added, that they could not hut see with 
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the 
governing pTOvideiice of God directs the events of 
things in the world, which they s.iid appeared in their 
circumstances ; for if, pi-essed by the hardships they 
were under, and the barrenness of the country where 
they were, they had searched after a better place to 
live in, they had then been out of the way of the 
relief that happened to them by my means. 

Then they gave me an account how the savages 
whom they lived among expected them to go out 
with them into their wars; and it was tnie, that as 
they had firearms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not 
have been serviceable only to their friends, but have 
made theinsehcs terrible both to friends and enemies , 
but being without powder and shot, and yet in a condi- 
tion that they could not in I’ea.son deii) to go out with 
their landloids to their wars, when they came into 
the field of battle they were in a woi-se condition 
than the savages themselves, for the> neither had 
bows or arrows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them, so that they could do nothing but stand 
still and be wounded with arrow's, till they came up 
to the teeth of their enemy ; and then indeed the 
three halberds they had were of use to them, and 
they would often drive a whole little army before 
them with those halberds and sharpened sticks put 
into the muzzles of their muskets , but that for all 
this, they were sometimes surrounded with multi- 
tudes, and in great danger from their arrows ; till at 
last they found the way to make themselves large 
targets of wood, which they covered with skins of 

r 112] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and these 
covered them from the arrows of the savages ; that 
notwithstanding these, they werc sometimes in great 
danger, and were once five of them knocked down 
together with the clubs of the savages, which was 
the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that 
is to say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved, that at 
first they thought had been killed; but when after- 
wards they heard he was taken prisoner, they were 
under the greatest grief imaginable, and would will- 
ingly have ventuicd their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me, that when they were so knocked 
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and 
stood over them, fighting till they were come to 
themselves, all but him who they thought had been 
dead ; and then they made their way with their 
halberds and pieces, standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, beat- 
ing down all that came in their way, got the victory 
over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because 
it was with the loss of their friend ; whom the othei 
party, finding him alive, carried off with some others, 
as I gave an account in my former. 

They described, most affectionately, how they were 
surprised with joy at the return of tbeir friend and 
companion in misery, who they thought had been 
devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz., by 
wild men ; and yet how more and more they were 
surprised with the account he gave them of his 
errand, and that there was a Christian in any place 
near, much more one that was able, and had human- 
ity enough, to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the 
sight of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance 
of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since 
their coming to that miserable place ; how often they 
crossed it, and bles.sed it, as bread sent ftom heaven ; 

VOL. n —9 [ 113 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to 
taste it, as also of the other things I had sent for their 
$upply. And after all, they would have told me 
something of the joy they were in at the sight of a 
boat and pilots to carry them away to the person 
and place from whence all these new comforts came ; 
but they told me it was impossible to express it by 
w'ords, for their excessive joy naturally driving them 
to unlxiconiing extravagances, they had no way to 
describe them but by telling me that they bordered 
upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their 
passion suitable to the sense that was upon them , 
that in some it woiked one way, and in some 
another , and that some of them, through a surprise 
of joy, would burst out into teai-s ; others lx; stark 
mad, and others immediately faint. This discourse 
extremely affected me, and called to my mind 
Friday’s ecstacy when he met his father, and the 
poor people’s ecstacy when I took them up at sea, 
after their ship was on fire ; the mate of tne ship’s 

a , when he found him.self delivered in the place 
Ere he expected to perish ; and niy own joy, when 
after twenty-eight yeai-s’ captivity I found a good 
ship ready to carry me to my own country. All 
these things made me more sensible of the relation 
of those poor men, and more affected with it 

Having thus given a view of the state of things 
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what 
I did fur these people, and the condition in which 
I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, 
that they would be troubled no more with the 
savages , or that, if they were, they would be able 
to cut them offj if they were twice as many as be- 
fore ; so they had no concern about that. Then I 
entered into a serious discourse with tlie Spaniard, 
whom !• called governor, about their stay in the 
island ; for as I was not come to carry any of them 

[m] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ofF, so it would not be just to carry off some and 
leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to 
stay if their strengtn was diminished. 

On the other hand, I told them I came to establish 
them there, not to remove them ; and then I let 
them know that I had brought with me relief of 
sundry kinds for them ; that 1 had been at a gt^eat 
charge to supply them with all thinm necessary, as 
well for their convenience as their defence ; and that 
I liad such and such particular pei-sons with me, as 
well to increase and recruit their number, as by the 

E articular necessary employments which they were 
reJ to, being artificers, to assist them in those 
things in which at present they wei-e to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to 
them ; and before I delivereil to them the stores I 
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that 
had been among them, and would shake hands with 
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and 
union of interest, that so there might be no more 
misunderstandings or jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and 
good-humour, said they had met with afflictions 
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends , that for his part, be would 
live and die with them , and was .so far from design- 
ing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned 
they had done nothing to him but what his own 
mad humours made necessary, and what he would 
have done, and perhaps much worse, in their ca.se ; 
and that he would ask them pardon, if 1 desired it, 
for the foolish and brutish things be had done to 
them , and was very willing and desirous of living 
in terms of entire friendship and union with them, 
and would do anything that lay in his power to 
convince them of it ; and as for going to England, 

[ 115 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

he cared not if he did nut go thither these twenty 
years. 

The Spaniai'ds said the} had indeed at first dis- 
armed and excluded Will Atkins and his two coun- 
trymen, fur their ill conduct, as they had let me 
know , and they appealed to me for the necessity 
they were under to do so , but that Will Atkins 
had. behaved himself so bravely in the gieat fight 
they had with the savages, and on several occasions 
since, and had shown himself so faithful to, and 
concerned for, the general interest of them all, that 
they had forgotten all tliat was past, and thought he 
merited as much to be trusted with arms, anef to be 
supplied with nec'essaries, as any of them , and that 
they had testified their satisfaction in him by com- 
mitting the command to him, next to the governor 
himself, and as they had an entire confidence in him 
and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they 
had merited that confident by all the iiietluxls that 
honest men could merit to be valued and ti listed ; 
and they most heartily eiiibinced the occasion of 
giving me this assuiaiice, that they would never have 
any interest separate from one anothei . 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friend- 
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together, 
and indeed we made a splendid feast I caused the 
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress 
our dinner, and the old cook’s mate we had on shore 
assisted. We bniught on shore six pieces of good 
beef, and four pieces of poik, out of the ship's pro- 
vision, with our punch-bowl, and matenals to fill it, 
and 111 particular, gave them ten bottles of French 
claret, and ten bottles of English beer, things that 
neither the Spaniards or the Englishmen had tasted 
for many years, and which it may be supposed they 
were exceraiiig glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, 

[ 116 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


which the cooks roasted , and three of them were 
sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the 
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from 
on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this fea-st, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, 
that there might be no dispute about dividing, 1 
showed them that there was sufficient for them all ; 
and desired that tlicy might all take an equal 
quantity of the goods that were for wearing ; tiiat 
is to say, equal when made up. At fimt, I dis- 
tnbuted linen sufficient to make every one of them 
four shii ts , and, at the Spaniards’ request, afterwards 
made them up six ; these were exceeding comfortable 
to them, having been what, as I may say, they had 
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear 
them. 

I allotted the thin English stuff*, which I men- 
tioned before, to make every one a light coat like 
a frock, which 1 judged fittest for the heat of the 
season, cool and loose ; and ordered that whenever 
they decayed they should make more, as they thought 
fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and 
hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, 
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men 
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnished them. They told me I 
was a father to them ; and that having such a cor- 
i^poiident as I was in so remote a part of the 
world, it w'ould make them forget that they were 
left in a desolate place , and they all voluntanly 
engaged to me not to leave the place without my 
consent 

Then I presented to them the people I had 
brought wiui me, particularly the tailor, the smith, 

[ 117 ] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


and tlie two carpenters, all of them most necessary 
people; but above all my general artiboer, than 
whom they could not name anything that was more 
useful to them ; and the tailor, to show his concern 
for them, went to work immediately, anil, with my 
leave, made them every one a shirt the first thing 
he did; and which was still more, he taught the 
women not onlv how to sew and stitch, and use the 
needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for 
their husbands and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how 
useful they were, for they took in pieces all my 
clumsy unhandy things, and made them clever con- 
venient tables, stools, beilsteads, cupboards, lockers, 
shelves, and everything they wanteii of that kind. 

But to let them see how Nature made artificers at 
first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins’s 
basket-house, os I called it, and they both owned 
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity 
before, nor anything so regular and so handily built, 
at least of its kind ; and one of them, when he saw 
it, after musing a good while, turning about to me, 
“ I am sure,” says he, “ that man has no need of us ; 
you need do nothing but give him tools ” 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, 
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and 
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs ; and to 
every separate place a pickaxe, ciow, a broad axe, 
and a saw ; always appointing, that as often as any 
were broken, or worn-out, they should be supplied, 
without grudging, out of the general stores that I 
left behind. 

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, 
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they 
had without tale as they rei^uired ; for no man would 
cara to take more than they wanted, and he must be 
a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account 
[ 118 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


whatever ; and for the use of the smith I left two 
tons of unwrought iion for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought 
them was such, even to piofusion, that they could 
not but rejoice at them ; for now they could march, 
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, 
if there was occasion , and werc able to fight a 
thousand savages, if they had but some little advan- 
tages of situation, which also they could not miss of 
if they had occasion 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose 
mother was starved to death, and the maid also ; she 
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman, 
and behaved so inoffensivclv, that every one gave her 
a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with 
us, there being no woman in the ship but herself ; 
but she boi-e it with patienca After a while, seeing 
things so well ordered, and in so tine a way of thriv- 
ing upon Illy island, and considering that they hod 
neither business or acqaintance in the East Indies, 
or reason for taking so long a voyage ; I say, con- 
sidering all this, both of them came to me, and de- 
siied I would give them leave to remain on the 
island, and be entered among iiiy family, as they 
called it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plat of 
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents 
or houses set up, sui rounded with a basket-work, 
palisadoed like Atkins’s, adjoining to his plantation. 
Their tents were contrived so, that they had each of 
them a room apait to lodge in, and a middle tent, 
like a great storehouse, to lay all their goods 
ill, and to eat and drink in. And now the other 
two Englishmen removed their habitation to the 
same place, and so the island was divided into three 
colonies, and no more, viz., the Spaniards, with old 
Friday and tha first servants, at my old habitation 
[ 119 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, 
and where they had so enlarged and extended their 
works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, 
that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full 
at large. Never was there sucli a little city in a 
wood, and so hid, I believe, in any part of the world ; 
for I verily believe a thousand men might have 
ranged the island a month, and if they had not 
known there was such a thing, and looked on pur- 
pose for it, they would not have found it , for the 
trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast 
matted into one another, that nothing hut cutting 
them down first c-ould discover the plac'e, except the 
only two nariow entrances where they went in and 
out could he found, which was not very easy. One 
of them was just down at the water edge of the 
creek, and it was after w aids above two hundred 
yards to the place ; and the other was up the ladder 
at twice, as I have already formerly desci-ibed it, and 
they had a large wood, thick planted, also on the 
top of the hill, which container! above an acre, 
which grew apace, and coveied the place from all 
discovery there, with only one narrow place between 
two trees,' not easy to be discovered, to enter on that 
side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where 
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean those 
I had left there, with their wives and children , three 
savages that were slaves ; the widow and children of 
the Englishman that was killed ; the young man 
and the maid , and by the way, we made a wife of 
her also before we went away There were also the 
two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with 
me foi them , also the smith, who was a very neces- 
sary man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take 
care of their arms ; and my other man, whom I 
called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as good 
[ 120 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


almost as twenty men, for he was not only a very 
ingenious fellow, but a \ery merry fellow ; and be- 
fore I went away we married him to the honest maid 
that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned 
before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me nat- 
urally to say something of the French ecclesiastic 
that I had brought with me out of the ship’s crew 
whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a 
Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some 
hereaftci if I leave anything extraordinary upon 
record of a man whom, before I begin, I must, to 
set him out in just colom-s, represent in terms very 
much to his disadvantage in the account of Protes- 
tants ; as, first, that he was a Papist ; secondly, a 
Popish pnest , and thirdly, a French Popish pnest. 

But justice demands of me to give him a due 
character ; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, 
pious, and most roligious jierson , exact in his life, 
extensive in his charity, and exemplaiy in almost 
everything he did. What, then, can any one say 
against iny heiiig very sensible of the value of such 
a mail, notwithstanding his profession ? though it 
may be my opinion, jierhaps, as well ns the opinion 
of others who shall lead this, that he wa.s mistaken 

The first hour that I began to converse with him, 
after he had agrecil to go with me to the East 
Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his 
conversation , and he first began with me about 
religion, in the most obliging manner imaginable. 

“Sir,” says he, “ you have not only, under God” 
(and at that he crossed his breast), “ saved my life, 
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in 
your ship, and by your obliging civility have taken 
me into your family, giving me an opportunity of 
free conveisation. Now, sir,” says he, “you see by 
my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

nation what yours Is; I may think it is my duty, 
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours 
on all occasions to bring all the souls I can to the 
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic 
doctrine ; but as I am heie undei ^our permission, 
and in )oiir family, I am bound, in justice to your 
kindness, as well as in decency and good manners, 
to be under 3 our government ; and therefore I shall 
not, without your leave, enter into any debates on 
the point of religion, in which we may not agi’ee, 
farther than you shall give me leave.” 

I told him his carriage was so modest, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true we were 
such people as they calle<l heretics, but that he was 
not the first Catholic that I had con\ci’scd with 
without falling into any inconveniences, or carrying 
the questions to any height in delvite , that he 
should not find himself the worse used for being of 
a different opinion from us , and if we did not con- 
\erse without any dislike on cither side upon that 
score, it should be his fault, not ours 

He replied that he thought all our conversation 
might be easily sepaiated from disputes , that it was 
hot his business to cap pnnciplus with every man he 
discoursed with , and that he rather desired me to 
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a relig- 
ieuse , that if I would give him leave at anv time to 
discourse upon religious subjer-ts, he would readily 
comply with it; and that then he did not doubt 
but I would allow him also to defend his ow'n opin- 
ions as well us he could , but that without my leave 
he would nut break in upon me with any such 
thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do 
all that liecame him 111 his office as a priest, as well 
as a private Christian, to procure the good of the 
ship, and the safety of ail that was in her ; and 
[ 128 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and 
he could not pray wiih us he hoped he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In 
this manner we conversed ; and as he was of a most 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if I 
may be allowed to sav so, a man of good sense, and, 
as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, 
and of the ntany extraordinary events of it ; of many 
adventuies which had befallen him in the few years 
that he had been abroad in the world, and particu- 
larly this was very remarkable, viz., that in the voy- 
age he was now engaged, he had had the misfortune 
to be five times shipped and unshipped, and never 
to go to the place whither any of the ships he w'as 
in were at first designed ; that his first intent was to 
have gone to Martinico, and that he went on board 
a ship bound thither at St. Malo ; but licing forced 
into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship received some 
damage by running aground in the mouth of the 
river Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo 
there; that finding a I’oituguese ship there bound 
to the Ma«ieiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he 
should easily meet with a vessel there bound to 
Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to the 
Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship 
being but an indifferent manner, had been out hi 
his reckoning, and they drove to Fayal ; where, 
however, he happened to find a very good maiket 
for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved 
not to go to the Madeiras, but to land salt at the 
Isle of May, and go away to Newfoundland. He 
had no remedy in this exigence but to go with the 
ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far as the 
Banks, so they call the place where they catch 
the fish, where meeting with a French ship bound 
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and 

[ m] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he 
thought he should have an opportunity to complete 
his ^t design. But when he came to Quebec the 
master of the ship died, and the ship proceeded no 
farther. So the next voyage he shipped himself for 
Fmnce, in the ship that was burnt, when we took 
them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the 
East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had 
been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call 
it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion 
to mention farther of the same person. 

But I shall not make digressions into other men's 
stories which have no relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our adair in the island. He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the island, and it happened to 
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen’s 
colony at the farthest part of the island , I say, he 
came to me, and told me with a very grave counte- 
nance 'that he had for two or three days desired an 
opportunity of some discourse with me, which he 
hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he 
thought it might in some measure con-espond with 
my general design, which was the prosperity of my 
new colony, and jierhaps might put it at least more 
than he yet thought it was in the way of God’s 
blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his 
diseoui'se, and turning a little short, “ How, sir,” 
said I, “ can it be said that wc arc not in the way of 
God’s blessing, after such visible assistances and 
wondeiful deliverances as we have seen here, and of 
which I have given you a large account ? ” 

“ If you had pleased, sir,” said he, with a world of 
modesty, and yet with great readiness, “to have 
heard me, you would have found no room to have 
been displeased, much less to tliink .so hard of mc^

that I should sug^st that ^ou ha\e not had wonder* 
ful assistances and deliverances , and 1 hope, on ^'our 
behalf, that ^ou are in the way of Grod’s blessing, 
and your design is exceeding good, and will prosper. 
But, sir, though it were more so than is even possible 
to you, yet there may be some among you that are 
not equally right in their actions , and you know 
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan 
in the camp removed God’s blessing from them, and 
turned His hand so against them, that six and thirty 
of them, though not concerned in the ciime, were 
the object of Divine vengeance, and bore the weight 
of that punishment.” 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told 
him his inference w as so just, and the whole design 
seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its 
own nature, that I w as very sorry I had interrupted 
him, and begged him to goon , and in the meantime, 
because it seemed that what we had both to say 
might take up some time, I told him I was going to 
the Englishmen’s plantations, and asked him to go 
with me, and we might discourse of it by the way. 
He told me he would nioie willingly wait on me 
thither, because there, partly, the thing was acted 
which he desired to speak to me alanit. So we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain 
with me in wfaat he had to say. 

“ Why then, sir,” says he, “ be pleased to give me 
leave to lay down a few propositions as the founda- 
tion of what I have to say, that we may not differ 
in the general priiiciple.s, though we may be of some 
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. 
First, sii, though we differ in some of the doctrinal 
articles of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is 
so, especially in the case before us, as I shall show 
afterwards; yet there are some general pnnciples in 
which we both agree, viz., fii-st, that there is a Go^ 
[ 126 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and that this God having given us some stated 
general rules for our service and obedience, we <ought 
not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, either 
by neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by- 
doing VI hat He has expressly forbidden ; and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is i-eadily owned us all, that the bless- 
ing of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptu- 
ous sinning against His command ; and every good 
Clnistian will be affectionately concerned to prevent 
any that are under his care, living in a total neglect 
of Go<l and His commands. It is not your men 
being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of 
such, that discharges me from being concerned for 
their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies befoie 
me, that they should live in as little distance from 
and enniify with their Maker as possible, especially 
if you give me leave to meddle so far in >our 
circuit ” 

I could not yet imagine w'hat be aimed at, and 
told him I granted all he had said, and thanked 
him that he would so far concern himself for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of w hat he 
had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own 
parable, I might put away the accursed thing from 
us. 

“ Why then, sir,” sap he, “ I will take the liberty 
yon give me ; and there aie three things which, if I 
am right, must stand in the way of God’s blessing 
upon voui endeavours here, and which I should re- 
joice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed 
And, sii,” says he, “I promise myself that you will 
fully agree with me in them all as soon as I name 
them ; especially because I shall convince you that 
every one of them may with great ease, and very 
much to jour satisfaction, be remedied.” 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, 

[ 126 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


but went on. “ First, sir,” says he, “ you have here 
four Englishmen, who havefetched women from among 
the sava^, and have taken them as their wives, and 
have had many children by them all, and yet are not 
married to them after any stated legal manner, as 
the laws of God and man require ; and therefore are 
yet, in the sense of both, no less than adulterers,* 
and living in adultery. To this, sir,” says he, “I 
know you will object, that there was no clergyman or 
priest of any kind, or of any profession, to perform 
the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to 
write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed 
between them. And I know also, sir, what the 
Spaniard governor has told yon , I mean of the 
agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
took these women, viz , that they should choose them 
out by consent, and keep separately to them ; which, 
by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement 
with the w'omen as wives, but only an agreement 
among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling 

“ But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri- 
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not 
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take 
one another as man and wife, but in the formal and 
legal obligation that there is in the contract to com- 
pel the man and woman at all times to own and ac- 
knowledge each other ; obliging the men to abstain 
from all other women, to engage in no other contract 
while these subsist ; and on all occasions, as ability 
allows, to provide honestly for them and their 
children ; and to obli^ the women to the same, or 
like conditions, mutatis mulandvt, on their side. 

“ Now, sir,” says he, “ these men may, when they 
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these 
women, disown their children, leave them to perish, 
and take other women and marry them whilst these 
are living.” And here he added with some warmth, 
[1871 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


** How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty ? 
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in 
this place, 'however good in themselves, and however 
sincere in your design, while these men, who at pres- 
ent are your subjects, under your absolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in 
' open adultery ? ” 

I confess I w&s struck at the thing itself, but 
much more with the convincing aiguments he sup- 
ported it with. For it was certainly true, that 
though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a 
formal contract on both sides, made before witnesses, 
and confirmed by any token which they had all 
agreed to be bound oy, though it had been but 
breaking a stick between them, engaging the men to 
own these women for their wives upon all occasions, 
and never to abandon them or their children, and 
the women to the same with their husbands, had 
been aji effectual lawful marriage in the sight of 
God, and it was a great neglect that it was not 
done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young 
pnest by telling him, that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived so man^ 
years with them now, that if it was an adultery it 
was past remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

“ Sir,” says he, “ 6isking your pardon for such 
freedom, jou are right in ^is; that it being done in 
your absence, you could not be charged with that 
part of the crime ; but I beseech you, flatter not 
yourself that you are not therefore under an obliga- 
tion to do your utmost now to put an end to it. 
How can you think but that, let the time past lie 
on whom it will, all the guilt for the future will lie 
entirely upon you ? Because it is certainly in your 
power now to put an end to it, and in nobby's 
power but yours.”

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I vas so dull still, that I did not take him right, 
but I imagined that by putting an end to it he 
meant that I should part them, and not suffer them 
to live together any longer, and I said to him I 
could not do this by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island into confusion. He seemed 
surprised that I should so far mistake him. “ No, 
sir,^ says he, “ I do not mean that you should now 
separate them, but legally and effectually marry 
them now ; and as, sir, my way of marrying them 
may not be so easy to reconcile them to, though it 
will be as effectual eien by your own laws ; so your 
way may be as well before God, and as valid among 
men , I mean by a written contract, signed by both 
man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, 
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be 
valid.” 

1 was amazed to see so much true piety, and so 
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartial* 
ity in his discourse, as to his own party or chui'ch, 
and such true warmth for the preserving people that 
he had no knowledge of or relation to; I say, for 
preserving them from transgressing the laws of God ; 
the like of which I had indeed not met with any- 
where. But recollecting what he had said of maiTv- 
ing them by a written contract, which I knew would 
stand too, I returned it back upon him, and told 
him I granted all that he had said to be just, and 
on his part very kind ; that I would discourse with 
the men upon the point now, when I came to them ; 
and I knew no reason why they should scruple to let 
him many them all ; which I knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in 
England, as if they were married by one of our own 
clergymen. What was afterwards done in this 
matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me wliat was the second

complaint which he had to make, acknowledging 
that I wtus very much his debtor for the first, and 
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would 
use the same freedom and plainness in the second, 
and hoped I would take it as well; and this was, 
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, 
as he called them, had lived with those women for 
almost seven years, had taught them to speak Eng- 
lish, and even to read it; and that they wcie, as he 
perceived, women of tolerable understanding and 
capable of instruction, >ct they had not to this 
hour taught them anything of the ('hristiaii lelig- 
ioii ; no, not so much as to know that there was a 
God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to 
be served , or that their own idolatry, and worship- 
ping they knew not whom, was false and absurd 
This, he said, was an unafcountable neglect, and 
what God would ceitainlv call them to aceount for, 
and perhaps at last take tiie w ork out of their hands 
He spoke this very affectionately and warnilv “I 
am persuaded,” says he, “ had those men lived in 
the savage country whence tlicir wives came, the 
savages would have taken nioie pains to have brought 
them to be idolaters, and to woi-ship the devil, than 
any of these men, so far as he could sec, had taken 
with them to teach them the knowledge of the tiue 
God. Now, sir,” said he, “ though I do not ac- 
knowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we should 
be glad to see the devil’s seivaiits, and the subjects 
of his kingdom, taught to know the general princi- 
ples of the Christian leligion, that they might 
at least hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and 
of the resiiriection, and of a future state, things 
wbirh we all believe ; they had at least been so much 
nearer coming into the bosom of the true Chu’’ch, 
than they are now in the public profession of idolatry 
and devil worship.”

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I could hold no longer ; I took him in iny arms, 
and embraced him with an excess of passion. “ How 
far,” said I to him, “have I been from understand- 
ing the most essential part of a Christian, viz., to 
love the interest of the Christian Church, and the 
good of other men’s souls ! I scarce have known 
what belongs to being a Chiistian.” — “Oh, sir, do 
not say so,” replied he ; “ this thing is not your 
fault.” — “No,” says I; “but why did I never lay 
it to heart as well as you?” — “^'is not too late 
\ et,” said he , “ be not too forward to condemn 
yourself.” — “ But what can be done now '* ” said I ; 
“you .sec I am going away.” — “Will you give me 
leave,” said he, “ to talk with these poor men about 
it'*” — “ Yes, with all my heart,” said I, “and 1 
will oblige them to give heed to what you say too.” 
— “ As to that,” said he, “ we must Ic'ave them to 
the merc-y of Christ ; but it is our business to assist 
them, encourage them, and instruct them , and if 
you will give me leave, and God His blessing, I do 
not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be 
brought home into the great ciivle of Christianity, 
into the particular faith that we all embrace ; and 
that even while you stay here.” Upon this I said, “ I 
shall not only give you leave, but give you a thou- 
sand thanks for it ” What followed on this account 
I sliall mention also again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which 
we were to blame. “ Why really,” says he, “it is of 
the same nature, and I will proceed, asking your 
leave, with the same plainness as before ; it is about 
your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your 
conqueivd subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or 
ought to be received among all Chi istians, of what 
Church, or pretended Chur^ soever, viz., ITie Chns- 
tian knowledge ought to be propagated by all pos- 
sible means, and on all possible occasions. T is on

this principle that our Church sends missionaries 
into Persia, India, and China ; and that our clergy, 
even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the 
most hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous 
residence among murderers and barbtu’ians, to teach 
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring 
them over to einbiace the Christian faith. Now, 
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six 
or seven and thirty poor savages lirought over from 
idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and 
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an 
occasion of doing good, which is really woith the 
expense of a man's whole life.” 

1 was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one 
word to say ; I had here a spirit of true Christian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular jirinciples be of what kind soever. As for me, 
I had not so much as entertained a thought of this 
in my heart before, and I believe should not have 
thought of it ; for I looked upon tlicse savages as 
slaves, and people whom, had we had any woik foi 
them to do, we would have used as such, or would 
have been glad to have transported them to any 
other part of the world ; for our business was to get 
nd of them, and we would all have been satisfied if 
they had been sent to any country, so they had 
never seen tlieir own. But to the case I .say, I was 
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what 
answer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, 
seeing me in some disorder. “ Sir,” says he, “ I 
shall be very sony if what I have said gives you 
any offence.” — *• No, no,” says I, “ I am offended 
with nolxidy but myself; but I am perfectly con- 
founded not only to think that I should never take 
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what 
notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir,” 
said I, ** what circumstances I am in ; I am bound

to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, 
and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of 
injustice to detain their ship here, the tneu lying all 
this while at victuals and wages upon the owners' 
account. It is true I agreed to be allowed twelve 
days here, and if I stay more I must pay sterling 
per diem demurrage, nor can I stay upon demur- 
rage above eight days more, and I have been here 
thirteen days already, so that I am perfectly unable 
to engage in this work, unless I would suffer myself 
to be left behind here again ; in which case, if this 
single ship should miscaiTy in any part of her voy- 
age, I should be just in the same condition that I 
was left in here at first, and from which I have been 
so wonderfully delivered.” 

He owned the ca.se was very hard upon me as to 
my voyage, but laid it home upon niy conscience, 
whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world 
for ^ I was not so sensible of that as he was. I re- 
turned upon him thus • “ Why, sir, it is a valuable 
thing indeed to be an instrument in God's hand to 
convert seven and thirty heathens to the knowledge 
of Christ ; but as you are an ec*clesiastic, and are 
given over to the work, so that it seems so naturally 
to fall into the way of your profession, how is it 
that you do not rather offer youreelf to undertake it, 
than press me to it ? ” 

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we 
walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made 
me a very low bow. “ I mast heartily thank God, 
and you, sir,” says he, “ for giving me so evident a 
call to so blessed a work ; and if you think your- 
self discharged from it, and desire me to undeilake 
it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy 
reward for all the hazanls and difficulties of such 
a broken disappointed ^ ^ with, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that I may be dropped at laat into so glorious a 
work.” 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he 
raoke this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his 
Sxe glowed, and his colour came and went as if he 
had Men falling into fits ; in a vvord, he was fired 
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I 
paused a considerable while before I could tell what 
to say to him, for I was really surprised to find a 
man of such sincerity and zeal, ana carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profession only, but even of any profession whatso- 
ever. But after I had considered it awhile, I asked 
him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he 
would venture, on the single consideration of any at- 
tempt on those poor people, to be locked up in an 
unplanted island for pernaps his life, and at last 
might not know whether he should be able to do 
them any good, or not ? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 
called a venture? “I’ray, sir,” said he, “what do 

{ ou think I consented to go in > our ship to the East 
ndies for ” — “ Nay,” said I, “ that I know not, 
unless it was to preach to the Indians ” — • “ Doubt- 
less it was,” said he, “and do you think if I can 
convert these seven and thirty men to the faith of 
Christ, it is not worth ray time, though I should 
never be fetched off the island again ^ Nay, is it 
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls 
than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the 
same pnifession ? Yes, sir,” says he, “ I would give 
Chnst and the Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if 
I could be made the least happy instrument of sav- 
ing the souls of these poor men, though I was never 
to set my foot off this island, or see my native coun- 
try any more. But since you will honour me,” says 
he, “ with putting me into this work, for which I 
[ 134 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


will pray for you all the days of my life, I have one 
humble petition to you,” said he, “ besides.” — 
“ What IS that ? ” said I. — “ Why,” says he, “ it 
is, that you will leave your man Fnday with me, to 
be my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; for 
without some help I cannot speak to them, or they 
to me.” 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, 
because I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reasons. He had been the companion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had 
resolved to do something considerable for him if he 
outlued me, as it was probable he would. Then I 
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant 
it wouhl quite confound him to bring him to em- 
brace another profession ; and he would never, 
while his eyes were open, believe that his old master 
was a heretic, and would be damned ; and this might 
in the end ruin the poor fellow’s principles, and so 
turn him to his first idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this 
strait, and it was this I told him I could not say 
that I was willing to part with Fiiday on any ac- 
count whateicr ; though a woik that to him was of 
more value than hi.s life, ought to be to me of much 
less value than the keeping or parting with a ser- 
vant, but on the other hand, I was persuaded that 
Fi iday would by no means consent to part with me ; 
and I could not force him to it without his consent 
without manifest injustice, because I had promised 
and engaged him to me that he wquld never leave 
me unless I put him away. 

He seemed very much concerned at it ; for he had 
no rational access to these pour people, seeing he did 
not understand one w’ord of their language, nor they 
one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told 

[ 185 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


him Friday's father had learnt Spanish, which I 
found he also understood, and he should seiwe him 
for an interpreter ; so he was much better satisfied, 
and nothing could persuade him but he would stay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another and very happy turn to eJI this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objec- 
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent 
for them all together ; and after some account given 
them of what I had done for them, viz., what neces- 
sary things I had provided for them, and how they 
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, 
and very thankful for, I b^an to talk to them of 
the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full 
account of the notice the clergyman had already 
taken of it , and arguing how unchristian and irre- 
ligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were 
married men or bachelors ? They soon explained their 
condition to me, and showed me that two of them 
were A'ldowers, and the other three were single men 
or bachelors. I asked them with what consciences 
they could take these women, and lie with them, as 
they hod done, call them their wives, and have so 
many children by them, and not be married lawfully 
to them ? 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz., 
that there was nobody to many them ; that they 
agieed befoie the governor to keep them as their 
wives, and to keep them and own them as their 
wives , and they thought, as things stood with them, 
they were as legally mamed as if they had been 
married by a pprson, and with all the formalities in 
the world. 

I told them that no doubt they were married in 
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not 

[ 186 f 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

muried, and so desert the poor women and children 
hereafter , and that their wives, beinsr poor, desolate 
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way 
to help themselves. I thereforb told them, that 
unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could 
do nothing for them ; hut would take care that what 
I did should be for the woineii and their children 
without them ; and that unless they would give some 
assurances that they would marry the women, I could 
not think it was convenient they should continue 
together as man and wife ; for that it was both 
scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they 
could not think would bless them if they went on 
thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, 
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for 
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they 
had been bom in their own native country, and would 
not leave them upon any account whatever ; land 
they did verily believe their wives were as virtuous 
and as modest, and did to the utmost of their skill 
as much for them and for their children as any 
women could possibly do, and they would not part 
with them on any account, and Will Atkins for his 
own particular added, if any man would take him 
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and 
make him captain of the best man-of-war in the 
navy, he would not go with him if he might not 
carry his wife and children with him ; and if there 
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be mairied to 
her now with all his heart. 

This was just as I would have it. The priest was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off ; so 
to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman 
with me, and if he was sincere I would have him 
married the next morning, and bid him consider of 
it, and talk \iitk the rest. He said, as for himself 
[ 137 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


he need not consider of it at all, for he was very 
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with 
me ; and he believed they would be all w illing also 
I then told him that my fnend the minister was a 
Fi'enchman, and could not speak English, but that I 
would act the clerk between them He never so 
much as asked me whether he was Papist or Protes- 
tant, which was indeed what I was afraid of, but, I 
say, they never in({uired about it. So we parted , I 
went back to my clergyman, and Will jVtkins went 
in to talk with his companions. I desired the French 
gentleman not to say anything to them till the busi- 
ness was thorough ripe, and I told bun what answei 
the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter they all came to 
me, and told me they had been considenng what I 
had said ; that they were very glad to hear I had a 
clergyman in my company ; and they were very 
willing to give me the satisfaction I desiicd, and to 
be formally married as soon as I jileased ; for they 
were far from desiring to part with their wi\es , and 
that they meant nothing but what was lery honest 
when they chose them. So I appointed them to 
meet me the next morning, and that in the mean- 
time they should let their wives know the meaning 
of the marriage law , and that it was not only to 
prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that 
they should nut forsake them, whatever might 
happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were veiy well satisfied with it, 
as indeed they had reason to lie, so they failed not 
to attend all together at my apartment the next 
morning, where I bi ought out my clergyman ; and 
though he had not on a minister's gown, after the 
manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after 
tlie manner of France , yet having a black vest, 
[ 188 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he 
did not look very unlike a minister ; and as for his 
language, I was liis interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and 
the scruples he made of marrying the women because 
they were not baptized and professed Christians, 
gave them an exceeding reverence for his person, 
and there was no need a^r that to inquire whether 
he was a clergyman or no. 

Indeerl I was afraid his scruple would have been 
carried so far as that he would not have married 
them at all , nay, notwithstanding all I was able to 
sav to him he resisted me, though modestly, yet very 
steadily, and at last refuseil absolutely to marry 
them unless he had fiist talked with the men and 
the women too, and though at first I was a little 
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good 
will, perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I 
had ae(]uainted him with their circumstances, and 
with the present design ; that he was very w ilhng to 
{lerforra that part of his function, and marry them 
as I had desired , but that before he could do it, he 
must take the lilierty to talk with them. He told 
them that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in 
the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all this 
while in an open adultery, and that it was true 
that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effect- 
ually separating them from one anotliei now, could 
put an end to it , but there was a difficulty in it too, 
with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, 
which he was not fully satisfied about, viz., that of 
maiTying one that is a professed Christian to a 
savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not 
baptized ; and yet that he did not see that there was 
time left for it to endeavour to persuade the women 
to he baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, 
[ 139 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and 
without which they could not be baptized. 

He told them, he doubted they were hut indiffer- 
«it Chriatians themselvea ; that they had but little 
knowledge of God or of His ways, and therefore he 
could not expect that they had said much to their 
wives on that head yet ; but that unless they would 
promise him to use their endeavour with their wives 
to persuade them to become Christians, and would, 
as well as they could, instruct them in the knowledge 
and belief of God that made them, mid to worship 
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not 
marry them ; for he would have no hand in joining 
Christians with savages , nor was it consistent with 
the principles of the Christian I'eligioii, and was in- 
dee<f expressly forbidden in God’s law. 

Thw heard all this very attentively, and I de- 
livered it very faithfully to them from This mouth, as 
near his own words as I could, only sometimes add- 
ing something of my own to convince them how just 
it was, and how I was of his mind , and I always 
very faithfully distinguished between what I said for 
myself and what were the clergyman’s words. They 
told me it was very true what the gentleman had 
said, that they were but very indifferent Chnstians 
themselves, and that thev never talked to their 
wives about religion. — “ Loid, sir,” savs Will At- 
kins, “ how should we teach them religion ? Why, 
we know nothing ourselves ; and besides, sir,” said 
he, “ should we go to talk to them of God, and 
Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, ’t would be to 
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe 
ourselves ; and if we should tell them we believe all 
the things that we speak of to them, such as of good 
people going to heaven, and wicked people to the 
aevil, they would ask us where we intend to go 
ourselves that believe all this, and are such wicked

fellows, as we indeed axe. Wh^, sir, 't is enough to 
give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing. 
Folks must have some religion themselves before 
they pretend to teach other people." — “Will At- 
kins,'^ said I to him, “ though I am afraid what you 
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell 
your wife that she 's in the wrong ; that there is a 
God, and a religion better than her own ; that her 
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear or speak ; 
that there is a great Being that made all things, and 
that can destroy all that He had made ; that He 
rewards the goM, and punishes the bad ; and that 
we are to be judged by Him, at last, for all we 'do 
here ? You are not so ignorant but even Nature 
itself will teach you that all this is true ; and I am 
satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it 
yourself.’^ 

“ That ’s true, sir," said Atkins ; “ but with what 
face can I say anything to m^ wife of all this, when 
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true?" — 
“ Not true ' " said I ; “ what do you mean by 
that ? " — “ Why, sir,” said he, “ she will tell me it 
cannot be true , that this God I shall tell her of can 
be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not 
punished and sent to the devil, that have been such 
a wicked creature, as she knows I have been, even to 
her, and to everybody else ; and that I should be 
suffered to live, that have been always acting so con- 
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what 
I ought to have done." 

“ Why truly, Atkins," said I, “ I am afraid thou 
speakest too much truth ; " and with that I Jet the 
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he was 
impatient to know. “ Oh ! " said the priest, “ tell 
him there is one thing will make him the best minis- 
ter 111 the world to his wife, and that is repentance ; 
for none teach repentance like true penitrats. He 
[ 141 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so 
much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he 
will then be able to tell her that there is not only a 
God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and 
evil ; but that He is a merciful Being, and with 
infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to 
punish thase that offend , waiting to be gracious, and 
willing not the death of a sinner, but lathcr that 
he should return and live ; that oftentimes suffers . 
wicked men to go on a long tune, and even leserves 
damnation to the general day of retribution , that it 
is a clear evidence of God, and of a future state, that 
righteous men receive not their rewanl, or wicked 
men their punishment, until they come into another 
world ; ana this will lead him to teach his wife the 
doctnne of the resun eetion, and of the last judg- 
ment. Let him but lepent for himself, he will bean 
excellent prewher of repentance to Ins wife” 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very 
serious' all the while, and who, we could easily per- 
ceive, was more than oitliiianl^ affected with it; 
when being eager, and hardly suffeiing me to make 
an end, “ I know all this, master,” says he, “ and a 
great deal more ; but I han't the impudence to talk 
thus to my wife, when God and my own conscience 
knows, and my wife will lie an undeniable evidence 
against me, that I have lived ns I had never heard 
of a God or future state, or anything aliout it , and 
to talk of my repenting, alas' ” and with that he 
fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that tears 
stood in his eyes, “ 't is past all that with me.” — 

“ Past it, Atkins ' ” said I , “ what dost thou mean 
by that?" — “I know well enough what I mean,” 
says he'; “I mean 'tis too late; and that is too 
true.” 

I told my clergyman word for woi-d what he said. 
The poor zealous priest (I must call him so, for be

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


hiii opinion what it will, be had certainly a most 
singular afFection for the good of other men's souls, 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like 
for his own), I say, this zealous, affectionate man 
could nut refrain tears aKo; but recoverihg himself, 
he said to me, “ Ask him but one question. Is he 
easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes 
it were not so?” I put the question faiily to 
Atkins ; and he answered with a great deal of pas< 
Sion, how could any man be easy in a condition that 
certainly must end in etenial destruction p that he 
was far from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, 
he believed it would one time or other ruin him. 
“What do you mean hy that'*” said I. “Why,” 
he said, “ he lielieved he should, one time oi other, 
cut his throat to put an end to tlie terror of it.” 

The clergyman shook his head, with a gi-eat con- 
cern in his face, when I told him all this ; but turn- 
ing quick to me upon it, says he, “ If that be his 
case, you may assure him it is not too late ; Christ 
will give him repentance. But pray,” says he, “ex- 
plain this to him, that as no man is saved but by 
Christ, and the merits of His passion, procuring 
Divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any 
man to receive mercy ? Does he think he is able to 
sin bejond the power or reach of Divine mercy'' 
Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked 
mercy will no longer stiive, and when God may 
refuse to hear ; but that 'tis never too late for men 
to ask mercy ; and we that are Christ’s servants are 
commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely 
repent, so that 'tis never hx) late to repent.” 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
earnestness , but it seemed as if he turned off the dis- 
course to the rest, for he said to me he would go 
and have some talk with his wife ; so he went out 
[143J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


awhile, and we talked to the rest I perceived thej 
were all stupidly ignorant os to matters of religion, 
much as I Has when I went rambling away from my 
father ; and yet that there were none of them back- 
ward to hear what had been said ; and all of them 
seriously promised that they would talk with their 
wives about it, and do their endeavour to persuade 
them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported 
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good 
while; but at last shaking his head, “We that are 
Christ’s servants,” says he, “can go no further than 
to exhort and iiistriict , and when men comply, sub- 
mit to tlie reproof, and promise what we ask, ’tis all 
we can do We are bound to accept their good 
woiris, but believe me, .sir,” said he, “whatever you 
mayf have known of the life of that man you call 
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere conveit 
among them. I take that man to be a true peni- 
tent , -I won’t despair of the rest, but that man is 
apparently sti'uck with the sense of his past life, 
ana I doubt not but when he wnnes to talk religion 
to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it , 
for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best 
way of teaching ourselves. I knew a man, who 
having nothing but a summary notion of religion 
himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last 
degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in 
himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that poor 
Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus 
Christ to his wife, my life for it he talks himself 
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent ; 
and who knows what may follow 

Umh this discourse, however, and their promising, 
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to em- 
brace Christianity, he married the other three couple ; 
but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. 
[ 144f ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


After this my dereyman, waiting awhile, was curious 
to know where Atuns was gone ; and turning to me, 

S s he, “I enti’eat you, sir, let us walk out of your 
yrinth here and look ; I dare say we shall find 
this poor man somewhere or other talking seriously 
to his wife, and teaching her already something of 
religion.'” I began to & of the same mind ; so we 
went out together, and I carried him a way which 
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so 
thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the 
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see 
out ; when coming to the edge of the wood I saw 
Atkins and his tawny savage wife sitting under the 
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped 
short till my cleigyman came up to me, and then 
having showed him where they were, we stood and 
looked very steadily at them a good while. 

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing 
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the neavens, 
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to 
himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
“ Now,'" says my cleigyman, “ you see my words ore 
made good, the man preaches to her , mark him now, 
he IS telling her that our Grod has made him, and 
her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, 
the trees, &c.'" — “I believe he is,” said I. Imme- 
diately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his 
feet, fall down on his l^nees, and lift up both his 
hands ; we suppose he said something, but we could 
not hear him ; it was too far for that. He did not 
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits 
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We 
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether 
she said anything or no we could not tell. While 
the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the 
tears run plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks, 
and I could hardly ^irbear myself ; but it was a great 
voi. n. — 10 [ 146 3

affliction to us both that we were not near enough to 
hear anything that passed between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear 
of disturbing them ; so we resolved to sec an end of 
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud 
enough to. us without the help of voice. He sat 
down again, as 1 have said, close by her, and talked 
again earnestly to her, and two or three times we 
could see him enihiHce hermttet passionately , another 
time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe 
her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of 
traiis[)ort very unusual; and aftci seveial of these 
things we sec him, on a sudden, ji'mp up ngani, and 
lend her his hand to help her up, when iniiiiLdiately 
leading her by the hand a step or two, they both 
kneeled down together, and tontinued so about two 
minutes. 

Mv friend could bear it no longer, hut cries out 
aIou(), “St. Paul, St. Paul, behold he riayeth'" 
I was afraid Atkins would heai him, therefore I 
entreated him to withhold himself awlule, that we 
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must 
confess, wa.s the most aflecting, and yet the most 
agreeable, that ever I saw in my liie. Well, he 
strove with himself, and contained himself for awhile, 
but was in sue h raptures of joy to think that the pooi 
heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was 
not ahle to contain himself. He wept seven 1 times , 
then thi owing up his hands and crossing his bieast, 
said over several things ejaculatory, and by way ot 
giving God thanks for .so miraculous a testimony of 
the success of our encleavouis. Some he spoke soitlv, 
and I could not well hear , others audibly , seme in 
Latin, some in French , then two or thiee times the 
teai-s of jov would interrupt him, that he could not 
speak at all. But I beggra that he w ould compose 
himself, and let us nicue narrowly and fully observe 

[ 146 ] 



ROBINSOxV CRUSOE 


what was before us, which he did for a time, and the 
scene was not ended there yet; for after the poor 
m ill and his wife were risen again from their knees, 
we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her ; 
and we observed by her motion that she was greatly 
affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up 
her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such 
other postures as usually express tlie greatest serious- 
ness and attention, lliis continued about half a 
quarter of an hour, and then they walked away 
too , so that we could see no more of them in that 
situation. 


I took this interval to talk with my clergyman ; 
and first I told him, I was glad to see the particulars 
we had both been witnesses to, that though I was 
hard enough of belief lu such cases, yet that I began 
to think it was all very sincere heie, Ixith in the man 
and his wife, however ignorant they might both be ; 
and I hoped such a beginning would have a yet more 
happy end , “ and who knows," said I, “ but these 
two may in time, by instruction and example, work 
upon -oine of the others >* " — Some of tliem ! " 
said he, turning quick upon me, “ ay, upon all of 
them Depend upon it. if those two savages, for he 
has been but little better as you relate it, should 
embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they 
woik upon all the rest, for true religion is natuially 
coininuiiicative, and he that is once made a Christian 
will never leave a pagan behind him if he can help 
it.” I owned it was a most Chnstian principle to 
think so, and a testimony of a true wial, as well as a 
generous heart in him. “ But, my friend," said I, 
•• will you give me leave to start one difficulty here ? 
I<anii.)t tell how to object the least thing against 
th it affectionate concern which you show for the 


turning the poor people fi’om their paganism to the 
Christian religion ; but how does this comfort you, 
[ 147 ] 



ROBIxNSON CRUSOE 


while these people are, in your acrount, out of the 
pale of the Catholic Church, without which, you 
believe, there is no salvation, so that you esteem 
these but heretics ; and for other reasons, as eflectu- 
ally lost as the pagans themsehes 

To this he answered with abundance of candour 
and Christian charity, thus: -“Sir, I am a Catholic 
of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of 
St Benedict, and I embrace all the pnnciples of the 
Roman faith ; but yet, if you will believe me, and 
that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in 
respect to my circumstances and your civilities; I 
say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call 
yourselves reformed, without some charity. I dare 
not say, though I know it is our opinion in geneial 
— I say, I dare not sa^ that you cannot be saved ; 
I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far 
as to think that He cannot receive you into the 
bosom of His Church, in a manner to us unper- 
ceivable, and which it is impos.siblc for us to know , 
and I hope you have the same chan tv for us I 
pray daily for your lieiiig all restored to Chnst’s 
Church, by whatsoever methods He, who is all- wise, 
is pleased to direct. In the meantime, sure you will 
allow it to consist with me, as a Roman, to distin- 
guish far between a Protestant and a pagan , be- 
tween one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a 
way which I do not think is aci-ording to the true 
faith, and a savage, a barbarian, that knows no God, 
no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if you are not within 
the pale of the Catholic Church, we hope you are 
nearer being restored to it than those that knew 
nothing of G<k 1 or His Church ; and I rejoice, there*- 
fore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has 
been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel 
down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he 
did, though not fully enlightened; believing that 
[ 148 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


God, from whom every such work proceeds, will sen- 
sibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further 
knowledge of that truth in His own time. And if 
God shidl influence this poor man to convert and 
instruct the poor ignorant savage his wife, I can 
never believe that he shall be cast away himself ; and 
have I not reason then to rejoice the nearer any are 
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they 
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of 
the Catholic Church, just in the time when I may 
desiie it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to 
'perfect His work in His own time, and in His own 
way? Certainly I would rejoic-e if all the savages 
in America were brought, like this poor woman, to 
pray to God, though they were to be all Protestants 
at first, rather than they should continue pagans 
and heathens; firmly believing, that He that had 
bestowed the first light to them, would further illu- 
minate them with a beam of His heavenly grace, 
and bring them inlo the pale of His Church, when 
He should sec good.'’’ 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of 
this truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed 
by the power of his reasoning; and it presently oc- 
curred to my thoughts that if such a temper was 
universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, what- 
ever church or particular profession we joined to, or 
joined in ; that a spint of charity would soon work 
us all up into right principles ; and, in a word, as he 
thought that the like chanty would make us all 
Catholics, so I told him I believed had all the mem- 
bers of his Church the like moderation, they would 
soon be all Protestants ; and there we left that part, 
for we never disputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way ; and taking 
him by the hand, “ My friend,” says I, “ I wish all 
the clergy of the Romish Church were blessed with 
[ 140 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ouch moderation, and had an equal share of your 
charity. I am entirely of your opinion ; but I must 
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine 
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the 
Inquisition.” 

“ It may be so,” said he ; “I know not what thej 
miglit do in Spain or Italy; but 1 will not say they 
wrould be the oetter Christians for that severity, for 
I am sure there is no heresy in too much chaiity.” 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our 
business there was over, so we went back our own 
way, and when we came back we found them waitings 
to be called in. Observing this, I asketl my clergy- 
man if we should discover to him that we had seen 
him under the bush, or no? and it was his opinion 
we should not ; but that we should talk to him first, 
and hear what he would say to us So we called him 
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves ; 
and I began with him thus 

“ Will Atkins,” said I, “ prythce what education 
had >ou ? What was your father 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, 
my father w as a clei^yman. 

R. C. What education did he give vouP 

W A. He would have taught me well, sir, but I 
despised all education, mstructioii, or correction, like 
a beast a.s I was. 

R. C. It ’s ti ue, Solomon says, “ He that despises 
reproof is brutish.” 

iV. A. Ay, sir, I wa.s brutish indeed , I murdered 
my fathei , for Gotl’s sake, sir, talk no more about 
that, sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Pr. Ha ' a muiderer • 

[Here the priest started, for I interpreted every 
word as he spoke it, and looked pale. It seems he 
believed that Will hatl really killed his own father.] 

R. C. No, no, sir ; I do not understand him so. 

[150] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Will Atkins, explain yourself. You did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own Hand ? 

W. A. No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut 
the thread of his comforts, and shortened his days ; 
I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural 
return for the most tender, affectionate treatment 
that ever father cave, or child could receive. 

R. C Well, I did not ask you about your father 
to extort this confession ; I pray God give you re- 
pentance for it, and forgive you that and ml your 
other sins , but I asked you because I see that, though 
you have not much learning, yet you are not so 
Ignorant as .some are in things that arc good ; that 
you have known more of religion a gitiat deal than 
you have practised. 

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con- 
fession that I made about my father, conscience dues ; 
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives, 
the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly 
the first that touch us , the wounds they make he the 
deejiest ; and the weight they leave w ill he heaviest 
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit. 

R. C You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, 
Atkins , I cannot bear it. 

W. A. You bear it, iiiastei ' I dare say you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, I 
may say every tree in this island, is witness to the 
anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and ba.se 
usage of a good tender father — a father much like 
yours by your description ; and I murdered my father 
as well as you. Will Atkins , but I think for all that 
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more, if I could have restrained 
my passions; but. I thought this poor man's rraent- 
ance was so much sincerer than mine, that I was 
going to leave off the discourse and retire, for I was 
ri5ii 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


surprised with what he said, and thought that, in- 
stead of my going about to teach and instruct him, 
the man was a teacher and instructor to me, in a 
most surprising and unexpected manner. 

I laid ^ this before the young clergyman, who was 
greatly affected with it, and said to me, “ Did 1 not 
say, sir, that when this man was converted he would 
preach to us all ? I tell you, sir, if this one man be 
made a true penitent, here will be no need of me ; 
he will make Christians of all in the island.” But 
having a little composed myself, I renewed my dis- 
course with Will Atkins. 

“ But, Will,” said I, “ how comes the sense of this 
matter to touch you just now ? ” 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has 
struck a dart thwiugh my %ery soul. I have been 
talking about (rod and religion to my wife, in order, 
as you directed me, to make a (Christian of her ; and 
she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall 
never foiget while I live. 

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to 
you ; but when you were moving religious arguments 
to her, conscience has flung them back upon you. 

W. A. Ay, sir, with such a foi-ce as is not to be 
resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between 
you and your wife, for I know something of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impos.sible to give you a full 
account of it. I am too full to hold it, and yet 
have no tongue to express it , but let her have said 
what she will, and though I cannot give you an ac- 
count of it, tins I can tell you of it, that I resolve 
to amend and reform my life. 

R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you be- 
gin, Will P for this has been an ei(traordinary case, 
that 's certain ; she has preached a sermon indeed, if 
she has wrought this upon you. 

[ 15 *] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

W. A, Why, I first told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were that 
men and women were obliged to enter into such 
compacts as it was neither in the power of one or 
other to break ; that otherwise, order and justice 
could not be maintained, and men would ibn from 
their wives and abandon their children, mix con- 
fusedly with one another, and neither families be 
kept entire, or inheritances be settled by legal 
descent. 

R. C. You talk like a civilian. Will. Could you 
make her understand what you meant by inheritance 
and families ^ They know no such thing among 
the savages, but marry luiyhow, without regard to 
relation, consanguinity, or family ; brother and sis- 
ter, nay, as I have b^n told, even the father and 
daughter, and the son and the mother. 

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed ; and 
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it. Perhaps for any farther relations they 
may not be so exact as we are, but she tells me 
they never touch one another in the near relations 
you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told 
her? 

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was 
much better than in her country. 

R. C, But did you tell her what maiTiage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay ; there began all our dialogue. I 
asked her if she would be married to me our way ^ 
She asked me what way that was ? I told marriage 
was appointed by God ; and here we had a strange 
talk together indeed, as ever man and wife had, I 
believe. 

[W. B. — This dialogue between W. Atkins and 
his wife, as I took it <kwn in writing, just after he 
told it me, was as follows.] 

[ 168 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


WiA. Appointed by your Grod ! Why, have you 
a Grod in your country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, Grod is in eveiyr country. 

Wife. No you God in my country ; iny country 
have the great old Benamuckce God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who 
God IS. God IS in heaven, and made the heaven 
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee dc earth ; no \ou God make all 
earth, no make my country. 

[W. A. laughcfl a little at her expi-ession of God 
not making her country.] 

Wife. No laugh , why laugh me ? This no thing 
to laugh. 

[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was 
more serious than he at first.] 

W. A. That’s true, indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 

Wife. Why you say, yon God make all ^ 

W. A. Yes, child, oui God made the whole 
world, and you, and me, and all things ; for He is 
the only true God , there is no (t(kI but Him , He 
lives for e\cr in heaven. 

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That’s true, iiideetl , but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with anything lx>fore, but have lived 
without God 111 the woild m\self. 

Wife What, have you de great God in you 
country, you no know Him ^ No say O to Him '' 
No do good thing for Him ? 'I'hat no possible ' 

W. A. It IS too true though, for all that ; we 
live aa if there was no God in heaven, or that lie 
had no power on earth. 

Wife But why God let you do so ? Why He no 
makee you good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

[ 164 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Wife. But you say me He is great, milch great, 
have much great power ; can makee kill when He 
will. Why He no makee kill when you no serve 
Him, no say O to Him, no be good mans P 

W. A. Tnat is true. He might stnke me dead, 
and I ought to expect it ; for I have been a wicked 
wretch, that is true , but Ood is merciful, and does 
not deal wuth us os we deserve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for 
that too ? 

W. A. No, indeed , I have not thanked God for 
His mercy, any more than I have feared God for 
His power. 

Wife. Tlien you Got! no God , me no think, be- 
lieve, He be such one, great, much power, strong, 
no makee kill you, though ^ou makee Him much 
angry. 

W. A. What ' will my wicked life hinder you 
from believing in God ? ^Vhat a dreadful ercature am 
I , and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid live‘ 
of Christians hinders the conveiwion of heathens * 

Wife. How me tink vou have great much God 
[she points up to heaven] up there and yet no do 
well, no d<i good thing Can He tell 'i Sure He 
,no tell what you do-' 

W. A. Yes, yes, He knows and secs all things , 
He hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we 
think, though we do not sjieak. 

Wife. What' He no hear )ou swear, curse, 
speak the great damn ^ 

W. A. Yes, ye.s. He hears it all. 

Wfe. Where be then the muchee great power 
strong ? 

W. A. He is merciful, that’s all we can say for 
it ; and this proves Him to be the tine God He 
is God, and not man, and therefore we are not 
consumed. 


[ 156 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with 
horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly 
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secr^ 
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and ^et 
that ne had dared to do all the vile things he had 
done.] 

W^e. Merciful ' what you call that ? 

W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and He 
pities and spares us. 

Wife. So then He never makee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked ; then He no good Himself, or 
no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; He is infinitely good, 
and infinitely great, and able to punish too , and 
sometimes, to show His justice and vengeance, He 
lets dy His anger to destroy sinners, and make ex- 
amples ; many are cut off in their sins. 

W^e. But no make kill you yet ; then He tell 
you, may be, that He no make you kill, so you 
mak*e de bargain with Him, you no bad thing, He 
no be angry at you, when He be angry at other 
mans ^ 

W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions 
upon His goodness ; and He would be infinitely just 
if He destroyed me, os He has done other men. 

Wyi. Well, and yet no kill, no makee jou dead ; 
what you say to Him for that? You no tell Him 
tankee for all that too? 

W. A. 1 am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that 's 
true. 

Wife. Why He no makee you much good better ? 
You say He makee you. 

W. A. He made me as He made all the world ; 

is I have deformed myself, and abused His good- 
ness, and mad* myself an abominable wretch. 

Wyii, I wish you makee God know me ; I no 
makee Him angiy ; I no do bad wicked thing. 

[166] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him 
to near a poor, untaught creature desire to be taught 
to know God, and he such a wicked wretch that he 
could not say one word to her about God but what 
the reproach of his own carriage would make most 
irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she 
had told him that she could not believe in God, 
because he that was so wicked Was not destroyed.] 

W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach 
you to know God,nort God to know you? for He knows 
you already, and every thought in your heart. 

Wife. Why then He know what I say to you 
now p He know me wish to know Him ; now snail 
me know who makce me ? 

W. A Poor creature, He must teach thee, I can- 
not teach thee ; 1 11 pray to Him to tench thee to 
know Him, and to forgive me that I am unworthy 
to teach th^. 

I^The poor fellow was in such an agony at her de- 
sinng him to make her know God, and her wishing 
to know Him, that he said he fell down on his knees 
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her 
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and 
to pardon his sins, and accept of his In'ing the un- 
worthy instrument of instructing her in the prin- 
ciples of religion ; after which he sat down by her 
again, and their dialogue went on. N.B. — This 
was the time when we saw him kneel down and lift 
up his hands.] 

Wyi. What you put down the knee for ? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Who 
you speak to P What is all that P 

W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my 
submission to Him that made me ; I said O to Him, 
as you call it, and as you say your ol& men do to 
their idol Benamuckee ; that is, I prayed to Him. 

Wife. What you say O to Him for P 
[167] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


W. A. I prayed to Him to open your ejres and 
your* undei-standing, that you may know Him, and 
be accepted by Him. 

Wife. Can He do that too ? 

W, A. Yes, He can ; He can do all things. 

Wife. But now He hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes , He has bid us pray to Him, and 
promised to hear us. 

Wtje. Bid you pray ? When He bid you ? How 
He bid you ? What, you hear Him speak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear Him speak ; but He 
has revealed Himself many ways to us 

[Here he was at a great loss to make her under- 
stand that God has revealed Himself to us by His 
Word ; and what Ills Word was , but at last he 
told it her thus.] 

IF. A. God has spoken to some good men in 
former days, even from heaven, by plain words ; and 
God has inspiied good men by His Spirit, and they 
have written all His laws down in a bwk. 

Wife. Me no understand that , where is book ^ 

W. A. Alas, my poor creature, I have not this 
book ! but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it 
for >ou, and help you to read it. 

[Here he embraced her with great affection ; but 
with inexpre.ssible grief that he had not a Bible ] 

Wife. But how }ou niakcc me know that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the same rule that we know Him to 
be God. 

Wife What rule!* what way _>ou know Him ? 

W. A Because He teaches and commands nothing 
but what IS good, nghteous, and holy, and tends to 
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy ; 
and because He forbids, and commands us to avoid, 
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its 
consequences. 

[ 168 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


W^e. That ine would understand, that me fain 
; if He teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked 
thing. He reward all good thing, punish all wicked 
thing. He make all thing. He give all thing; He 
hear me when I say O to Him, as you go do just 
now ; He makee me good if I wish be good ; He 
spare me, no inakee kill me when I no be good ; all 
this you say He do , yet He lie great God ; me take, 
think, believe him be great God ; me say O to Him 
too with vou, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer ; but 
raising her up, made her kneel by him ; and he 
prayed to Goa aloud to instiuct her in the knowl- 
edge of Himself by His Spirit ; and that by some 
good providence, if po>eiihle, she might some time or 
other come to have a Bible, that she might read the 
Word of God, and be taught by it to know Him. 

This was the time that »e saw hiiii lift her up by 
the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after 
this, too long to set down here , and particularly she 
made him promise, that since he confessed his own 
life had been a wicked abominable coui'se of provo- 
cation against God, that he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more, lest he should make 
him dead, as she called it, and then she should be 
left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told 
her wicked men should be after death. 

I'his was a strange account, and very affecting to 
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman. 
He was indeed wonderfully surprised with ii^ but 
under the greatest affliction imaginable that he 
could not talk to her; that he could not speak 
English to make her understand him, and as she 
spoke but very broken English, he could not under- 
stand her. However, he turned himself to mey and 
[ 169 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


told me that he believed there must be more to 
do with this woman than to marry her. I did not 
understand him at first, but at length he explained 
himself, viz., that she ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was 
for going about it presently. “ No, no ; hold, sir,” 
said he ; “ though I would have her be baptized by 
all means, yet I mast observe that Will Atkins, her 
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful 
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life; 
and has given her Just ideas of the being of a God, 
of His power, justice, mercy ; jrct I desire to know 
of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus 
Christ, and of the salvation of sinners , of the nature 
of faith in Him, and redemption by Him ; of the 
Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and 
a future state.” 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but the 
poor, fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us 
ne had said something to her of all those things, but 
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his 
own conscience so reproached him with his horrid 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions 
that her knowledge of him should lessen the atten- 
tion she should give to those things, and make her 
rather contemn religion than receive it , but he was 
assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to 
receive due impressions of all those things, that if 
I w’ould but discourse with her, she would make it 
appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not 
be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as 
interpreter between my religious prie.st and the 
woman, I entreated him to begin with her. But 
sure such a sermon was never preached by a Popish 

E riest in these latter ages of the world ; and as I told 
im, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, 

ri 60 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of 
a Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be such 
a clergyman as the Roman bishops were before the 
(Jhurra of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over 
the consciences of men. 

In a woid, he brought the pour woman to embrace 
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by Him, 
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did 
the first notions of a God, but with joy and faith, 
with an affection, and a surprising degree of under- 
standing, scarce to be imagined, much less to be 
expressed ; and at her own request she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated 
him that he would perform that office with some 
caution, that the man might not perceive he was of 
the Roman Church, if possible, because of other ill 
consequences which might attend a difference among 
us in that very religion which we were instructing 
the other in. He told me that as he had no con- 
.secrated chapel, no proper things for the office, I 
should see he would do it in a manner that I should 
not know Iw it that he was a Roman Catholic my- 
self if I had not known it before. And so he did ; 
for saying only .some words over to himself in Latin, 
which I could not understand, he poured a whole 
dishful of water upon the woman’s head, pronouncing 
in French very loud, “ Mary,” — which was the name 
her hu-iband desired me to give hci, for I was her 
godfather — “I baptize thee in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; ” 
so that none could know anything by it what rclimon 
he was of. He gave the benediction afterwai^ in 
Latin , but either Will Atkins did not know but it 
was in French, or else did not take notice of it at 
that time. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned himscdf to 
VOL n. — 11 [ 161 ] 



ROBINSdN CRUSOE* 


Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex- 
horted him not only to persevere in that good dis- 
position he was in, but to support the convictions 
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his 
life , told him it was in vain to say he repented if he 
did not forsake his crimes ; represented to him how 
God had honoured him with teing the instrument 
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian 
religion, and that he should be careful he did not 
dishonour the grace of Gad , and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Chnstian than himself; 
the savage converted, and the instrument cast away. 

He said a great many good things to them both, 
and then recommending them, in a few words, to 
God's goodness, gave them the benediction again, I 
repeating everything to them in English, and thus 
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most 
pleasant, agreeable day to me that ever I passed in 
my whole life. 

•But my cleigyinan had not done yet. His 
thoughts hung continually upon the conversion of 
the seven and thirty savages, and fain he would have 
stayed upon the island to have undertaken it , but 
I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was im- 
practicable ill itself; and secondly, that, peihaps, I 
would put it into a way of being done, in his absenie, 
to his satis&ction , of which bv-and-by. 

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a 
narrow compaiss, I was preparing to go on board the 
ship when the young man, whom I had taken out of 
the famished ship's company,- came to me, and told 
me he understood I had a clergyman with me, and 
that I caused the Englishmen to be married to the 
savages whom they called wives , that he had a 
match too which he desired might be finished before 
I went, between two Christians, which he hoped 
would not be disagreeable to me. 

[ 162 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I knew this must be the young woman who was 
his mother's servant, for there was no other Chris- 
tian woman on the island. So I began to persuade 
him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or be- 
cause he found himself in this solitary circumstance. 

I represented to him that he had some considerable 
substance in the world, and good friends, as I under- 
stood by himself, and by his maid also ; that his 
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was un- 
equal to him, she being six or seven and. twenty 
years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; 
that he might very probably, with my assistance, 
make a remove from this wilderness, and come into 
his own country again, and that then it would be a 
thousand to one but he would repent his choice, and 
the di.slike of that circumstance might be disadvan- 
tageous to both. I was going to say more, but he 
interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great 
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses , that 
he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts, his , 

f ii’esent circumstance lieiiig melancholy and disconso- 
ate enough , and he was very glad to hear that I 
had thoughts of putting them in a way to see their 
country again ; and nothing should have put him 
upon staying there but that the voyage I was going 
was so exceeding long and hazardous, and- would 
carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends ; 
that he had nothing to desire of me but that I 
would settle him in some little propei-ty in the is- 
land where he was, give him a servant or two, and 
some few necessaries, and he would settle himself 
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if 
ever I returned to England, 1 would redeem him, 
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came into England ; that he would give me some 
letters to his friends in London, to let them know 
how good I had been to him, and in what part of 
[ 168 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the world, and what circumstance I had left him in ; 
that he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, 
the plantation, and all the improvement he had 
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should 
be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered consider- 
ing his youth, and was the more agreeable to me be- 
cause he told me positively' the match was not for 
himself. I gave him all possible as-iuraiiccs that, if 
1 lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his 
letters, and do his business effectually, and that he 
might depend I would never forget the circumstance 
I had left him in. But still I was impatient to 
know who were the persons to be mari'ied , upon 
which he told me it was my Jack-of-all-trades and 
his maid Susan. 

I was most agreeablv surpnsed when he named 
the match, for indeed I thought it very suitable. 
The character of that man I have given already ; 
and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, 
sober, and religious young woman ; had a very good 
share of sense ; was agreeable enough in her person , 
spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose , always 
with decency and good manneis, and not backwaid 
to speak when anything required it, or impei'tmently 
forward to speak when it was not her business , very 
handy and housewifely in anything that was before 
her ; an excellent manager, and tit indeed to have 
been governess to the whole island She knew very 
well how to behave to all kind of folks slie had 
about her, and to better if she had found any 
there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we 
married them the same day ; and &s I was father at 
the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave 
her a portion, for I appointed her and her husband 
a hanosome large space of ground for their planta- 
[ 164 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


tion ; and indeed this match, and the proposal the 
young gentleman made, to give him a small property 
in the island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst 
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about 
their situation. 

This shai'ing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober, 
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceeding 
pious and religious, ana as far as I may be allowed 
to speak positively in such a case, I verily believe 
was a true sincere penitent. 

He divided things so justly, and so much to every 
one’s satisfaction, that they only desired one general 
writing under my , hand for the whole, which I caused 
to be drawn up and signed and sealed to them, setting 
out the bounds and situation of every man’s planta- 
tion, and testifying that I gave them thereby, sever- 
ally, a right to the whole possession and inheritance 
of the respective plantations or farms, 'with their 
improvements, to them and their heirs ; reserving 
all the rest of the usland as iny own property, and a 
certain rent for every paiticular plantation after 
eleven years, as I or any one from me, or in my 
name, came to demand it, producing an attested 
copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themselves , only 
made them promise me to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another ; and so I prepared 
to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and this is, that being 
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them- 
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but 
odd to ha^e seven and thirty Indians live in a 
nook of the island, independent, and indeed unem- 
ployed ; for excepting the providing themselves food, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


which they had difficulty enough in too, sometimes, 
the}’ had no manner of business or property to 
manage. I proposed therefore to the governor 
Spaniard that he should go to them with Friday’s 
father, and propose to them to remove, and either 

i ilant for themselves, or take them into their several 
amilies as servants, to be maintainefi for their labour, 
but without being absolute slaves; for I would not 
admit them to make them slaves by force by any 
means, because they had their liberty given them by 
capitulation, and as it were, articles of surrender, 
which they ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and 
came all very cheerfully along with him , so we 
allotted them land and plantations, which tlirec or 
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employid 
as servants in tlie several fiimilies we had settled , 
and thus my colony was in a manner settled as fol- 
lows’ — The Sjianiards possessed my original habi- 
tation, which was the capital city, and extended their 
plantations all along the side of the brook, which 
made the creek that I liave so often described, as far 
as my bower ; and as they inci'eased their culture, it 
went always eastward. The English lived in the 
iioith-eost part, where Will Atkins and his com- 
rades began, and came on southward and south- 
west, towai-ds the back part of the Spaniards , and 
eveiy plantation had a great addition of land to take 
in if they found occasion, so that they need not 
jostle one another for want of I’oom 

All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, 
that if any of the savages should come on shore there, 
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might 
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would 
disturb them ; ana no doubt but they were often 
ashore and went away again, for I never heard that 
the planters were attacks or disturbed any more. 
[ 166 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


It now came into my thoughts that I hod hinted 
to iny friend the clergyman that the work of con- 
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in 
his absence to his satisfaction ; and I told him that 
now I thought it was put in a fair way, for the 
savages being thus divid^ among tlic Christians, if 
they would but every one of them do their part 
with those which came under their hands, I hoped 
it might have a very good effect. 

He agreed pre.scntfv in that “ If,” said he, “ they 
will do their part, but how,” sa\s he, “shall we 
obtain that of them I told him we would call 
them together, and leave it in charge with them, 
or go to them one by one, which he tliought best. 
So we divided it — he to speak to tlie Spaniards, 
who were all Papists, and I to the English, who were 
all Protestants , and wc recommended it enniestly 
to them, and made them piumisc that they never 
would make any distinction of Papist or Protestant 
in their exhorting the savages to turn C'hnstians, 
but teach them the gcneial knowledge of the true 
G(k 1, and of their Savioui Jesus Chiist, and the} 
likewise promised us that they would never have 
any differences or disputes one with another about 
religion. 

When I came to Will Atkins’s house — I may 
call it so, for such a house, or such a piece of b.u>ket- 
work, I believe was not standing in the woild again ; 
I my when I came there, I tbiiiid the young w oinan 
I have mentioned above and Will Atkins’s wife 
were become intimates , and this prudent, religious 
young woman had jierfected the woik Will Atkins 
had begun , and tliough it was not alxive four days 
aftei what I have related, }et the new- baptize 
savage woman was made such a Chnstian as I have 
seldom heal'd of any like her in all niy obsei'vation 
or conversation in the world. 

[167] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

It came next into my mind in the morning, be- 
lore I went to them, that amongst all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left them 
a Bible ; in which I showed m vself less considering 
for them than my good firiend the widow was for 
me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds 
from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and 
a prayer-book. However, the good woman's charity 
hw a greater extent than ever she imagined, for 
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction 
of those that made much better use of them than 
1 had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket ; and when 
1 came to Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found 
the young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had 
been discoursing of religion together — for Will 
Atkins told it me with a gi-eat deal of joy — I 
a-<ked if they were together now, and he said yes. 
So I .went into the house, and he with me, and we 
found them together, very earnest in discourse. “ O 
sir,” says Will Atkins, “when God has sinners to 
reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bnng home. He 
never wants a messenger ; my wife has got a new 
instructor — I knew I was unworthy, as I was in- 
capable of that work — that young woman has been 
sent hither from heaven — she is enough to convert 
a whole island of savages.” The young woman 
blushed, and i-ose up to go aw ay, but I de.sired her to 
sit still. I told her she had a good work upon her 
hand-s, and I hoped God would bless her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though I did not ask ; 
but I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my 
Bible. “ Here,” says I to Atkins, “ I have brought 
you an assistant that perhaps you had not before.” 
rhe man was so confounded, that he w'as not able to 
speak for some time; but recovering himself he

takes it with both his hands, and turning to his 
wife, “ Here, my dear,” says he, “ did not I tell you 
our God, though He lives above, could hear what 
we said ? Here ’s the book I prayed for when you 
and I kneeled down under the bush ; now God has 
heal'd us, and sent it.” When he had said so, the 
man fell into such transports of a passionate joy, 
that between the joy of having it, and giving God 
thanks for it, the tears ran down his &ce Uke a 
child that was crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have 
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of ; 
for ske firmly believed God had sent the book upon 
her husband's petition. It is true that providentially 
it was so, and might be taken .so in a consequent 
sense ; but I believe it would have been no flifficult 
matter at that time to have persuaded the poor 
woman to have believed that an cxpre.ss messenger 
came from heaven on purpose to bring that individ- 
ual book. But it was too senous a matter to suffer 
any delusion to take place , so I turned to the young 
woman, and told her we did not dcsiie to impose 
upon the new convert in her first and more ignorant 
understanding of things, and begged her to explain 
to her that God may be veiy properly said to answer 
our petitions when in the course of His providence 
such things are in a particular manner brought to 
pass as we petitioned for; but we do not expect re- 
turns from heaven in a niiiaculous and particular 
manner , and that it is our mercy that it is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually ; 
so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft usm 
here ; and I should have thought it one of the mast 
un|ustiKable frauds in the world to have had it so. 
But the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really 
not to be expressed ; and there we may be sure there 
was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thank-

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ful in the world for anything of its kind than he 
was for his Bible ; nor, I believe, never any man was 

f lad of a Bible from a better principle. And though 
e had been a most profligate creatiii’e, desperate, 
headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a 
great degree, yet this man is a standing rule to us 
ml for the well instructing children, viz., that parents 
should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever 
despair of the success of their eiideav oure, let the 
children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or to ap- 
pearance insensible of instruction ; for if ever God 
in His providence touches the consciences of such, 
the force of their education i-cturns upon them, and 
the early instruction of paients is not lost, though 
it may have been many y'ears laid asleep, but some 
time or other they may find the benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man ; however ignorant 
he was, or divested of religion and Christian knowl- 
edge, he found he had some to do with now more 
ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the 
instruction of his good father that could now come 
to his mind was of use to him 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how 
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible 
value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to 
nations, families, and poi'sons , but he never enter- 
tained the lea.st notion of the woith of it till now, 
when being to talk to heathens, savages, and bar- 
barians, he wanted the help of the w i itten oracle for 
his assistance. 

The young woman was ver} glad of it also for the 
present occasion, though she had one, and so had the 
vouth, on board our ship among their goods, which 
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having 
said so many things of this joung woman, I cannot 
omit telling one story more of her and myself, which 
has something in it ver^ infoi ming and remarkable. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I have related to what extremity the poor young 
woman was reduced ; how her mistress was starved 
to death, and did die on board that unhappy ship 
we met at sea ; and how the whole ship's company 
being reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewoman 
and her son, and this maid, weie first hanlly used as 
to ptovisions, and at last totally neglected and 
starved ; that is to say, brought to the last extremity 
of hunger. 

One day being discouraing with her upon the ex- 
tremities they suffered, I asKcd her if she could de- 
scribe by what she had felt what it was to starve, and 
how it appeared ? She told me she believed she 
could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus ; — 

“ First, sir,” said she, “ we had for some days fared 
exceeding hard, and suffeied very great hunger, but 
now at last we were wholly without food of any kind 
except sugar, and a little wine, and a little water. 
The first day after I had received no food at all, I 
found myself towards evening first empty and sickish 
at my stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined 
to yawning, and sleepy. I laid down on a couch in 
the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, 
and awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass 
of wine when 1 lay down. After lK*ing about three 
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morn- 
ing, I found myself empty, and my stomai-h sickish, 
and laid down again, but could not sleep at all, being 
very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all the 
second day, with a strange variety — first hungry, 
then sick again, with Teachings to vomit. The 
second night, lieing obliged to go to bed again with- 
out any food more than a draught of fair water, and 
being asleep, I di-eamed I was at Barbadoes, and that 
the market was mightily stocked with provisions, 
that I bought some for my mistiess, and vrent and 
dined very heartily. 

[ 171 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


“ I thought my stomach was as full after this as 
any would have been after or at a good dinner ; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits 
to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last 
glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, 
teeause of its having some spirit to supply nourish- 
ment ; but there being no substance in the stomach 
for the digesting office to work upon, I found the 
only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable 
fumes from the stomach into the head ; and I lay, 
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, 
for some time. 

“ The thii'd day, in the morning, after a night of 
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and ratlier 
dozing than sleeping, I waked, ravenous and furious 
with hunger ; and I question, had not my under- 
standing returned and conquered it, I say, I question 
whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little 
child with me, its life would ha\e been safe or not. 
This lasted about three hours, dunng which time I 
was twice raging mad ns any creature in Bedlam, as 
my young master told me, and as he can now' inform 
you. 

“In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, 
whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of 
my foot I know not, I fell down, and struck my face 
against the comer of a pallet bed, in which my 
misti'ess lay, and with the blow the blood gushed 
out of my nose, and the cabin-boy bringing me a 
little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal, 
and as the blood ran from me I came to myself, and 
the violence of the flame or the fever I was in abated, 
and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. 

“Then I grew sick and reached to vomit, but 
could not. for I had nothing in my stomach to biing 
up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and 
they all believed I was dead ; but I came to myself 
[ 178 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 
stomach, not to be described, not like the colic, but 
a gnawing, eager pain for food ; and towards ni^ht 
it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing 
for food, sonietliiiig like, as I suppose, tlie longing of 
a woman with child. I took another draught of 
water with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed the 
sugar, and brought it all up again ; then I took a 
draught of water without sugar, and that stayed 
with me, and I laid me down upon the bed, praying 
most heartily that it would please God to take me 
away , and composing my mind in hopes of it, I 
slumbered awhile ; and then waking, thought myself 
dying, being light with vapours from an empty 
stomach. I recommended my soul then to God, and 
earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into 
the sea. 

“ All this while my mistress lay by me just, as I 
thought, expiring, but bore it with much more pa- 
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had 
left to her child, my young master, who would not 
have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it ; and I 
believe it sav^ his life. 

“ I'owaids the morning I slept again, and first 
when I awaked I fell into a violent passion of crying, 
and after that had a second fit of violent hunger. I 
got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition. 
Had my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her 
I am cei'tain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh 
with a.s much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I 
did the flesh of any creature appointed for food ; 
and once or twice I was going to bite my own arm. 
At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I 
had bled at my nose the day before. I ran to it, 
and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy 
appetite, as if I had wondered nobody had taken it 
bcrore, and afraid it would be taken from me now. 

[ 173 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


“Though after it was down the thoughts of it 
filled me with horror, yet it checked the nt of hun- 
ger, and I drank a draught of fair water, and was 
composed and refi-eshed for some hours after it. 
This was tlie fourth da^ ; and thus I held it till 
towards night, when, within the annpass of three 
hours, I had all these several circumstances over 
again, one after another, viz., sick, sleepy, eagerly 
hungry, pam m the stomach, then ravenous again, 
then sick again, then lunatic, then cmng, then rav- 
enous again, and so every quarter of an hour , and 
my strength wasted exceedinglv. At night I laid 
me down, having no comfoi’t but in the hope that I 
should die before morning. 

“ All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger 
was now turned into a disease, and I had a tcmble 
colic and griping by wind instead of food having 
found its way into the bowels , and in this condition 
I lay till moiTiing, when I was surpnsed a little with 
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who 
called out to me that his mother was dead. I lifted 
myself up a little, for I had not strength to ri.se, but 
found she was not dead, though she was able to ^ve 
very little signs of life. 

“ I had then such convulsions in my stomach for 
want of .some sustenance, that I cannot describe, 
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that 
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and 
in this condition 1 was when I heard the seamen 
above cry out ‘ A sail ! a sail ! ' and halloo and jump 
about as if they were di.vtracted. 

“ I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
mistress much less, and my young master was so sick 
that 1 thought he had been expiring ; so we could 
not open the cabin-door, or get any account what it 
was that occasioned such a combustion ; nor had we 
had any conversation with the ship's company for 
[ 174 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


two days, they having told us that they had not a 
mouthful of anything to eat in the ship ; and they 
told O') afterwards they thought we had been dead. 

“ It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were sent to save our lives ; and how you found 
us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too.” 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct 
account of starving to death as I confess I never met 
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me. I am 
the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, 
because the youth gave me an account of a good 
part of it , though I must own not so distinct and 
so feelingly as his maid, and the rather because it 
seems his mother fed him at the price of her own 
life ; but the poor maid, though her constitution 
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in 
years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle 
harder with it , I say, the poor maid might ne 
supposed to feel the extremity something sooner 
than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the 
last bit something longer than she parted with any 
to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is 
here related, if our ship, or some other, had not so 
providentially met them, a few days more would 
have ended all their lives, unless they had prevented 
it by eating one another ; and even that, as their 
case stood, would have served them but a little 
while, they being five hundred leagues from any 
land, or any possibility of relief, other than in the 
miraculous manner it happened. But this is by 
the way ; I return to my disposition of things among 
the people. 

And first, it is to be observed here, that for many 
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any- 
thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought 
•of setting up among them ; for I found, at least at 
[ 176 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


my first coming, such seeds of divisions among them, 
that' I saw it plainly had 1 set up the sloop, and 
left it among them, they would, upon every light 
disgust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another ; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so 
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plan- 
tation of sober and religious people, so as I intended 
it ; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon 
that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns 
that my nephew took extraordinarily, for the same 
I'eason. I thought it was enough to qualify them 
for a defensive war against any that should invade 
them, but not to set them up for an offensive war, 
or to encourage them to go abioad to attack others, 
which, in the end, would only bring ruin and de- 
struction upon themselves and all their undertaking 
I reserved tW sloop, therefore, and the guns for their 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

I have now done with the island. I left them all 
in mod circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, 
ana went on board ray ship again the [fifth day] of 
[May], having heen five and twenty days among 
them; and as they were all resolved to stay upon 
the island till I came to remove them, I promised 
to send some farther relief from the Brazils, if I 
could possibly find an opportunity , and particularly, 
I promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, 
hogs, and cows; for as to the two cows and calves 
which I brought from England, we had been obliged, 
by the length of our vpyage, to kill them at sea 
for want of hay to feed them 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at 
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All 
^ints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days, 
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but tHis, 
that about three days after we sailed, being be-

ROBINSON CRUSOE, 

calmed, and the current setting strong to the E.N.E., 
running, as it were, into a bav or gulf on the land 
side, «we were driven something out of our course , 
and once or twice our men cried land to the east' 
ward ; but whether it^was the continent, or islands, 
we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth 
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were 
covered towards the land with something very black ; 
not being able to discover what it was till, after some 
time, our chief mate going up the main shrouds a 
little way, and looking at them with a perspective, 
cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what 
he meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, 
calling the fellow a fool, or some such word “ Nay, 
sir,” says he, “ don’t be angiy, for 't is an army, and 
a fleet too ; for I believe there arc a thousand canoes, 
and you may see them paddle along, and they are 
coming towards us too, apace.” 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was 
my nephew, the captain ; for he had heard such 
terrible stones of them in the island, and having 
never been in those seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but said two or three times 
we should all be devoured. I must confess, consider- 
ing we were becalmed, and the current set strong 
toivards the shore, I liked it the worse. However, 
1 bode him not be afraid, but bring the ship to an 
anchor as soon as we came so near to know that we 
must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us ; so I gave order to come to an 
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the .savages, I 
told them they had nothing to fear but Are; and 
therefore they should get their boats out, and fiisten 
them, one close by the head, and the other by the 
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue 
Toi.n.-X8 [ITT] 



.ROBINSON CRUSOE 


in that posture. This I did, that the men in the 
boats might be ready, with skeets and buckets, to 
put out any fire the^ savages might endeavour to 
fix to the outside of the ship. In this posture we 
lay by for them, and in a little while they came up 
with us ; but never was such a horrid sight seen by 
Christians. My mate was much mist^en in his 
calculation of their numbei', I mean of a thousand 
canoes, the most we could make of them when they 
came up being about a hundred and six and twenty ; 
and a great many of them too ; for some of them 
had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some 
more, and the least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us they seemed to be 
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight 
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; noi 
could they at first, as »e afterwards understood, 
know, what to make of us. They came boldly up, 
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about 
to row round us , but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them 

This very order brought us to an engagement with 
them, without our designing it; for five or six of 
their large canoes came so near our longboat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
back, which they understood very well, and went 
back , but at their retreat about fifty arrows came 
on board us from those boats, and one of our men 
in the longboat was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any 
means ; but we handed dowrii some deal boards into 
the boat, and the carpenters presently set up a kind 
of fence, like waist boards, to cover them from the 
arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. 

About half-an-hour afterwards they came all up 
in a body astern of ^us, and pretty near us, so near 
that wc could easily discern what they were, though 
[ 178 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


we could not tell their design ; and I easily fiaind 
they were some of ray old friends, the same sort of 
savages that I had been used to engage with ; and in 
a little time more they rowed a little fiirther out to 
sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and 
then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so 
near, that they could hear us speak. Upon this I 
ordered all my men to keep close, less they should 
shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns 
ready; but being so near as to be within bearing, 1 
made Friday go out upon the deck and call out aloud 
to them in his language to know what they meant, 
which accordingly he did. Whether they understood 
him or not, that I knew not, bgt as soon as he had 
called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost 
or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us, 
and stooping down, showed us their naked back* 
sides ; just as if, in English, saving your presence, they 
had bid us kiss — — . Whether this was a defiance 
or challenge, we know not ; or whether it was done 
in mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest , but 
immediately Friday cried out they were going to 
shoot ; and unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let 
fly about three hundred of their arrows, and to my 
inexpiessible grief killed poor Friday, no other man 
being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with 
no less \han three arrows, and about three more 
fell very near him , such unlucky marksmen they 
were. 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, 
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that 
I immediately oidered five guns to be loaded with 
small shot, and four with great, and gave them such 
a broadside as they had never heard in their live.s 
before, to be sure. They were not above half a 
cable length off when we fired ; and our gunners 
took their aim so well, that three or four of their 
[ 179 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by 
one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides 
to us, gave us no great offence : neither did I know 
for certain whether that, which would pass for the 
greatest contempt among us, might be understood 
so by them or not ; theiefore in leturn I had only 
resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with 
powder only, which I knew would flight them suffi- 
ciently ; but when they shot at us directlv with all 
the fury they were capable of, and especially as they 
had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved 
and valued, and who, indeed, so well deseived it, I 
not only had been justified bcfoie God and man, 
but would have been very glad, if I could, to have 
overset every canoe there, and drowned every one of 
them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how 
many we wounded, at this broadside ; but sure such 
a flight and hurry never was seen among such a 
multitude. There were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes split and overset, in all, and the men all set 
a-swimining , the rest, flighted out of their wits, 
scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little 
care to save those whose boats were split oi spoiled 
with our shot. So I suppose that they were many 
of them lost ; and our men took one poor fellow 
swimming for his life above an hour after they were 
all gone. 

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill 
and wound a great many, but, in short, wo never 
knew anything how it went with them ; for they fled 
so fast, that in three hours, or therealjouts, we could 
not see above three or four straggling canoes ; nor 
did we ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze of 
wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and 
set sail for the Brazils. 

[ 180 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so 
sullen, that he would neither eat or speak ; and we 
all fancied he would starve himself to death. But I 
took a way to cure him ; for I made them take him 
and turn him into the longboat, and made him be> 
lievc they would toss him into the sea again, and so 
leave him where they found him if he would not 
speak. Nor would that do; but they really did 
throw him into the sea, and came away from him ; 
and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, 
and called to them in his tongue, though they knew 
not one word of what he said. However, at last 
they took him in again, and then he began to be 
more tmctable ; nor did I ever design they should 
drown him. 

We weie now under sail again; but I was the 
most disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man 
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the island to have taken one of the rest 
from thence for iny occasion, but it could not be ; so 
we went on. We hod one pnsoncr, as I have said ; 
and ’twas a long while berore we could make him 
understand anything, but in time our men taught 
him some English, and he began to be a little tract- 
able. Afterwards we inquired what country he 
came from, but could make nothing of what he said ; 
for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoke 
m the throat in such a hollow odd manner, that we 
could never form a word from him ; and we were all 
of opinion that they might speak that language as 
well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we 
perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, 
tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just 
as a hunting-horn forms a tune with an open throat. 
He told us, however, some time after, when we 
taught him to speak a little English, that they were 
going, with their kings, to fight a great battle. 

[ 181 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


When he said kings, we ^ked him how many kings. 
He said they were five nation (we could not make 
him understand the plural s), and that they all joined 
to go against two nation. We asked him what made 
them come up to iis ? He said, “ To makee to great 
wonder look.” Where it is to be observed, that all 
those natives, as also those of Afiica, when they 
learn English, they always add two e's at the end of 
the words where we use one, and make the accent 
upon them, as makel^ takee, and the like; and we 
could not break them off it ; nay, I could hardly 
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
must take my last leave of him, poor honest Friday ! 
We buned him with all the decency and suleii)nity 
possible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing 
him into the sea , and I rau.sed them to fire eleven 
guns for him , and so ended the life of the most 
grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate ser- 
vant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, 
and in about twelve days' time we made land in the 
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the 
north-easternmost land of all that part of Ameritn. 
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days, 
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three 
days came to an anchor off of the Bay of All Saints, 
the old place of my delivemnee, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this part that had less busi- 
ness than I had, and yet it was with great difficulty 
that we were admitted to hold the least correspond- 
ence on shore. Not my planter hiin.sclf, who was 
alive, and made a great figure among them, not my 
two merchant trustees, not the fame of my wonderful 
preservation in that island, could obtain me that 
favour; but my partner remembering that I had 
[18S] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


given five hundred nioidores to the prior of the 
monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and 
obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor 
and get leave for me peisonally, with the captain 
and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on 
shore, and no more ; and this upon condition abso- 
lutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to 
land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any 
person away without licence. 

They were so strict with us as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine 
broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had 
brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-heai ted man, 
though, like me, he came from little at first ; and 
though he knew not that I had the least design of 
giving him anything, he .sent me on board a present 
of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth 
above thirty monlores, including some tobacco, and 
three or four fine medals in gold. But I was even 
with him in my present, which, as I have said, con- 
sisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine 
hollaiids. Also I delivered him about the value of 
.flOO sterling, in the same goods, for other uses; 
and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had 
brought with me from England, as I have said, for 
the Use of my colony, in order to send the refresh- 
ments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got Hands, and finished the sloop* 
in a very few days, for she was ready framed ; and I 
gave the master of her such instructions as he could 
not miss the place ; nor did be miss them, as I had 
an account from my partner afterwards. I got him 
soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them ; and 
one of our seamen, that had b^n on shore with me 
[ 183 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, 
upon Riy letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot 
him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation , 
and giving him some clothes, and tools for his plant- 
ing work, which he said he understood, having been 
an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into 
the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; 
and as an addition, I gave him the savage wh ch we 
had taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered 
the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every- 
thing he want^ with the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner 
told me there was a certain very honest fellow, a 
Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the displeasure of the Church. “I know not 
what the matter is with him,” says he, “ but, on my 
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and 
he has bc^cn obliged to conceal himself for fear of the 
Inquisition ; ” that he would be very glad of such an 
opportunity to make his escape with his wife and two 
daughters , and if I would let them go to the island, 
and allot them a plantation, he would give them a 
small stock to begin with , for the oflirers of the 
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and 
he had nothing left but a little household stuff, and 
two slaves. “ And,” adds he, “ though I hate his 

E nnciples, yet I would not have him fall into their 
ands, for he would assuredly be burnt alive if he 
does.” 

I granted this presently, and joined my English- 
man with them , and we concealed the man and his 
wife and daughters on board our ship, till the sloop 
put out to go to sea ; and then, having put all their 
goods on board the sloop some time before, we put 
them on board the sloop after he was got out of 
the bay. 

[ 184 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new 
partner ; and their stock, indeed, was much alike, rich 
in tools, in preparations, and a farm ; but nothing to 
begin with, but as above. However, they carried 
over with them, which was worth all the rest, some 
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants 
of canes ; which he, 1 mean the Portugal man, under- 
stood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants 
in the island, I sent them by their sloop three milch 
cows and five calves, about twenty- two hogs, among 
them three sows big with pig, two mares, and a 
stone-horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go ; and recom- 
mended it to them to many them, and use them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I 
remeinbered that the poor persecuted man had two 
daughters, and there was but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted , the rest had wives of their own, 
though in anothei country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily 
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who 
were now, with this addition, between sixty and 
seventy people, besides little children, of which there 
was a great many. I found letters at London from 
them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came back 
to England, of wbicb I shall also take some notice 
immediately. 

I have now done with my island, and all manner 
of discourse about it ; and whoever reads the rest 
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his 
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to rend of the 
follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, 
much less by those of other men, to beware of the 
like ; not cooled by almost forty years’ misery and 
disappointments, not satisfied with prosperity be*

yond expectation, not mode cautious by affliction 
and distress beyond imitation. 

1 had no more business to go to the East Indies 
than a man at full liberty, and having committed no 
crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate and de- 
sire him to lock him up among the prisoners there 
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from 
England, and went directly to the island; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the 
necessaries for the plantation, and for my people , 
took a patent from the governor here to have se- 
cured my property, iii subjection only to that of 
England; had I carried over cannon and ammuni- 
tion, servants and people, to plant, and taking pos- 
session of the place, fortified and strengthened it in 
the name of England, and increased it with people, 
as 1 might easily have done ; had I then settled 
myself there, and sent the ship back loaden with 
good rice, as I might also have done in six months’ 
time, and ordered niy friends to have fitted her out 
again for our supply ; had I done this, and stayed 
there myself, I had at least acted like a man of 
common-sense But I was possessed with a wander- 
ing spirit, sconied all advantages ; I pleased myself 
with oeing the patron of those people I placed there, 
and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic 
way, like an old patriarchal monarch ; providing for 
them, as if I had been father of the whole family, 
as well as of the plantation. But I never so much 
as pretended to plant in the name of any govern- 
ment or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to 
call my people subjects to any one nation mdre than 
another; nay, I never so much as gave the place 
a name, but left it as I found it, belonging to no 
man, and the people under no discipline or govern- 
ment but my own, who, though I had influence over 
them as fatner and benefactor, had no authority or

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

power to act or command one way or other, farther 
than voluntaiy consent moved them .to comply. 
Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done 
well enough ; but as I rambled from them, and 
came there no more, the last letters I had from any 
of them was by my partner's means, who afterwards 
sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me 
word, though I had not the letter till five years after 
it was written, that they went on but poorly ; were 
malcontent with their long stay there; that Will 
Atkins was dead; that five of the Spaniards were 
come away , and that though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had had 
some skirmishes with them , and that they begged 
of him to wnte to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their 
ow'ii country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and 
they that will have any more of me must be content 
to follow me through a new variety of follies, hard- 
ships, and wild adventures , wherein the justice of 
Providence may be duly observed, and we may see how 
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make 
th§ strongest of our wishes be our afHietion, and punish 
us most severely with those very things which we think 
it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. 

I^et no wise man flatter himself with the strength 
of his own judgment, as if he was able to choose any 
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short- 
sighted creature, sees but a very little way before 
him ; and a.s his passions are none of his best friends, 
so his particular affections are generally his worst 
counsellors. 

I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I 
had from a youth to wander into the world, and how 
evident it now was that this principle w'as preserved 
in me for niy punishment. How it came on, the 
[ 187 ]

manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion of it, 
it is easy to give you historically, and with its utmost 
variety of particulars ; but tlie secret ends of Divine 
Power in thus permitting us to be burned down the 
stream of our own desires, is only to be understood 
of those who can listen to, the voice of Providence, 
and draw religious consequences from God's justice 
and their own mistakes. 

Be it I had business, or no business, away I went. 
'Tis no time now to enlarge any farther upon the 
reason or absurdity of my own conduct , but to come 
to the history. I was embarked for the voyage, and 
the voyage I went. 

I should only add here, that my honest and tiuly 
pious clergyman left me here, a ship heing ready 
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither, 
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any 
voyage he began. How happy had it been for me if 
I liad gone with him ' 

But it was too late now, all things Heaven ap- 
points are best. Had I gone with him, I had never 
nad so many things to be thankful foi, and you had 
never heard of the becond Part of the Tiavels and 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; so I must leave 
here the fruitle.ss exclaiming at myself, and go on 
with my voyage. 

From the Brazils we made directly away over the 
Atlantic sea to the Cape de Bonne Espcrance, or, as 
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope , and had a toler- 
able good voyage, our course generally south-east; 
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. 
But my disasters at sea were at an end ; my future 
rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore, 
that it might appear the land was as well prepared 
to be our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, who 
directs the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint 
it to be so. 

[ 188 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a 
supercargo on board, who was to direct all her 
motions after she arrived at the Cape ; only being 
limited to certain numbers of days for stay, by 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. 
This was none of my^ business, neither did I meddle 
with it at all; niy nephew the captain, and the 
supercai'go, adjusting all those things between them 
as they thought fit. 

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was 
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of 
our way for the coast of Coromandel. We were in- 
deed informed that a French man-of-war of fifty 
guns and two large merchant ships were gone for the 
Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with France, I 
had some apprehensions of them ; but they went 
their way, and we heard no inoi'e of them. 

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with 
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, varia- 
tions of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances, 
trade winds, situation of ports, and the like , .such as 
almost all the histories of long navigation are full of, 
and makes the reading tiresome enough, and are 
perfectly unprofitable to all that read it, except only 
to those wlio aie to go to those places themselves. 

It IS enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our 
passing from one to another. We touched first at 
the island of Madagascar, where, though the people 
are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very 
w'ell armed with lances and bows, which they use 
with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well 
with them a while ; they treated us very civillv; and 
for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, 
scissors, &c., they brought us eleven good fat bul- 
locks, middling in size, but very gmid in flesh, 
which we took in, partly for fir^h provisions for 

[ 189 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

our present spending, and the rest to salt for the 
ship’s use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after 
we had furnished ourselves with provisions ; and I, 
that was always too curious to look into every nook 
of the world wherever I came, was for going on 
shore as fast os I could. It was on the east side of 
the island that we went on shore one evening, and 
the people, who by the way are \ery numerous, came 
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance ; but as we had traded fi-eely with them, and 
had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no 
danger. But when we saw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a dis- 
tance from us, which it seems is a mark in the country 
not only of truce and fiieiuLship, but when it is 
accepted the other side set up throe poles or boughs, 
which is a signal that they accejit the truce too , but 
then this is a known condition of the truce, that you 
are not to pass between their three poles towards 
them, nor they to come past ^our three poles or 
boughs towai ds you , so that ) ou are pci feray secure 
within the three poles, and all tlie space between 
your [Kiles and theirs is allowed like a market for 
free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you go 
there, you must not cairy your weapons with you ; 
and if they come into that space, they stick up their 
javelins and lances, all at the first jioles, and come 
on unarmed , but if any violence is offered them, 
and the truce thoitiby broken, away they run to the 
poles and lay iiold of their weapons, and then the 
truce IS at an end. 

It happened one evening when we went on shore 
that a greater number of their people came down 
than usual, but all was very frieudly and civil, and 
they brought in seieral kinds of provisions, for which 
we satisfied them with such toys as we had ; their 
[ 190 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


women also brought us milk and roots, and several 
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet ; and 
we made us a little tent or hut, of some Doughs of 
trees, and lay on shore all night. 

I knew not what was the occasion, but I was not 
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the 
boat lying at an anchor about a stone cast from the 
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I 
made one of them come on shore, and getting some 
boughs of trees to cover us also in the Mat, I spread 
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under 
the cover of the branches of trees all night in the 
boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one 
of our men make a terrible noise on the shore, call- 
ing out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and 
come and help them, for they were all like to be 
murdered ; at the same time I heard the firing of 
five muskets, which was the number of the guns 
they had, and that three times over ; for it seems 
the natives here were not so easily frighted with 

f uns as the savages were in America, where I had to 
o with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; 
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I 
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with 
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist our 
men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men 
were in too much haste ; for being come to the 
shore, they plunged into the water to get to the 
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur- 
sued by between three and four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them .had 
fusils with them , the rest had, indeed, pistols and 
swords, but they were of small use to tnem. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty 

[ 191 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


enoagh too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and that which was still worse was, that while we 
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on shore ; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we 
were fain to barricade the side of the boat up with 
the benches and two or three loose boards, which to 
our great satisfaction we had by meie accident, or 
providence, in the boat. 

And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, 
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen 
but the least part of any of us, they would have 
been sure of us We had, by the light of the moon, 
a little sight of them as they stood pelting us from 
the shore with darts and anows; and having got 
ready our firearms, we gave them a volley, and we 
could hear by the cries of some of them that we had 
wounded several. However, they stood thus in bat- 
tle ajrray on the shore till breat of day, which we 
suppose was that they might see the better to take 
their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, becau.se we 
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as 
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bud in a tree with 
small shot. We made signals of distre.ss to the ship, 
which, though we lode a league off, yet my nephew, 
the captain, heaniig our finng, and by glasses per- 
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired 
towards the .shore, pretty well understood us , and 
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the 
shore as be durst w'ith the ship, and then sent an- 
other boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but 
we called to them not to come tix) near, telling them 
what condition we were in. However, they stood in 
nearer to us ; and one of the men taking the end of 
a tow-line in. his hand, and keeping our boat between

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly 
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line 
to the boat, upon which we slipped our little cable, 
and leaving our anchor behind, tney towed us out of 
reach of the airows, we all the while lying dose be- 
hind the barricade we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and 
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, 
she ran along ju.st by them, and we poured in a 
broadside among them, loaden with pieces of iron and 
lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great 
shot, which made a terrible havoc amongst them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occasion of this 
fray; and indeed our supercargo, who had been 
often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he 
was sure the inhabitants would not have toucVied us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not done some- 
thing to provoke them to it. At length it came 
out, viz , that an old woman, who had come to sell 
us some milk, had brought it within our poles, with 
a young woman with her, who also brought some 
roots or herbs , and while the old woman, whether 
she was mother to the young woman or no they 
could not tell, was selling us the milk, one of our 
men offei'ed some rudeness to the wench that was 
with her, at which the old woman made a great 
noise. However, the seaman would not quit his 
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight 
among the trees, it being almost dark. The old 
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose, 
made an outcry among the people she came from ; 
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us m 
three or four hours , and it was great odds but we 
had been all destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at 
him just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


out of tHe tent they had made ; the rest came off 
&ee, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all 
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black 
mistress, for we could not hear what became of him 
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days 
after, though the wind presented, and made signms 
for him; made ou'r boat sail up shore and down 
shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we were obliged 
to give him over ; and if he sdone had suffered for it, 
the loss had been the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven- 
turing on shore once more to try if I could leani 
anything of him or them. It was the third night 
after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if 
I could by any means, what mischief we had done, 
and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I 
was careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be 
attacked again ; but I ought indeed to have been 
sure. that the men I went with had been under my 
command before I engaged in a thing so hazardous 
and mischievous, as I was brought into by it without 
my knowledge or design. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in 
the ship, besides the su[iei-cargo and myself, and we 
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place 
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening be- 
fore. I landed here, because my design, as I have 
said, was chiefly to see if they had quitt^ the field, 
and if they had left any marks behind them of the 
mischief we had done them , and I thought if we 
could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might 
get our man again by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our 
men into two bodies, whereof the boatswain com- 
manded one, and I the other. We neither saw or 
heard anybody stir when we landed, and we marched 
up, one Dody at a distance from the other, to the 
[194J 



ROBIltSON CRUSOE 


S lace, but at first could see nothing, it being very 
ark ; till by-and-by our boatswain, that led the 
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. 
This made them halt awhile; for knowing by the 
circumstances that they were at the place where the 
Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up. 
Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to 
rise, which we knew would be in less than an hour, 
when we could easily discern the havoc we had made 
among them. We told two and thirty bodies upon 
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead ; some 
had an arm, and some a leg, shot oif, and one his 
head , those that were wounded we supposed they 
had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was 
resolved for going on board ; but the boatswain and 
his party sent me word that they were resolved to 
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go 
along with them ; and if they could find them, as 
still they fancied they should., they did not doubt 
getting a good booty, and it might be they might 
find Tho. Jeffery there ; that was the man's name 
we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leaie to go, I knew well 
enough what answer to have ^iven them ; for I 
would have commanded them instantly on board, 
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run who 
had a ship and ship-loading in our chai^, and a 
voyage to make, which depended very much upon 
the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word tney 
were resolved to go, and only asked me and my 
company to go along with them, 1 positively refused 
it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in 
order to go to the boat. One or two of the men 
began to importune me to go, and when 1 refused 
[1961 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

positively began to grumble, and say they were not 
under niy command, and they would go. “ Come, 
Jock,” says one of the men, “ will you go with me ? 
I'll go for one." Jack said he would ; and another 
followed, and then another ; and in a word, they all 
left me hut one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a 
boy left in the boat ; so the supercargo ana I, with 
the third man, went back to the boat, where we told 
them we would stay for them, and take care to take 
in as many of them as should be left ; for I told 
them it was a mad thing they were going about, 
and supposed most of them would inin the fate of 
Thomas Jeffery. 

They told me, like .seamen, they'd warrant it 
they would come off again, and they would take 
care, &c. So away they went. I entieated them to 
consider the ship and voyage ; that their lives were 
not their own ; and that they were entrusted with 
the voyage in some measure , that if they miscar- 
ried, the ship might be lost for want of their help , 
and that they could not answer it to God or man. 
I said a great deal more to them on that head, but 
I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the 
ship , they were mad upon their journey ; only they 
gave me good wortls, and begg^ I would not be 
angry , that they would be very cautious, and they 
did not doubt out they would be back again in 
about an hour at farthest, for the Indian town, 
they said, was not above half a mile off, though 
they found it above two miles before they got 
to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and though 
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but 
madmen would have gone about, yet, to give 
them their due, they went about it as warily as 
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that's true; 
for they had every man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, 
[ 196 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and every man a pistol; some of them had broad 
cutlasses, some of them hangers, and the boatswain 
and two more had pole-axes ; besides all which they 
had among them thirteen hand grenades. Bolder 
fellows, and better provided, never went about any 
wicked work in the world. 

When they went out their chief design was plun- 
der. and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold 
there , but a circumstance, which none of them were 
aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and made 
devils of them all. When they came to the few 
Indian houses which they thought had been the 
town, which was not above half a mile off, they 
were under a great disappointment ; for there were 
not above twelve or thirteen houses , and where the 
tow'n was, or how big, they knew not. They con- 
sulted therefore what to do, and were some time 
before they could resolve ; for if they fell upon these 
they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to 
one but some of them might escape, it being in the 
night, though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, 
he would run away and raise all the town, so they 
should have a whole army upon them. Again, on 
the other hand, if they went away, and left those 
untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could 
not tell which way to look for the town. 

However, the last was the best advice; so they 
resolved to leave them, and look for the town as 
well as they could. They went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree ; this they presently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them ; for they said 
the COW' certainly belonged to the town before them 
or the town behind them, and if they untied her 
they should see which way she went. If she went 
back, they had nothing to say to her ; but if she went 
forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her ; 
so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, 

[ 197 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and the cow went on before them. In a word, the 
cow led them directly to the town, which, as they 
report, consisted 6f above two hundred houses or 
huts, and in some of these they tound several families 
living together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly 
secure as sleep and a country that had never seen 
an enemy of that kind could made them And first 
they called another council to consider what thw 
had to do, and in a word, they resolved to divide 
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses 
on fire in three parts of the town , and as the men 
came out, to seize them and bind them , if any le- 
sisted, they need not be asked what to do then, and 
so to search the rest of the houses for plunder ; but 
they resolved to march silently first through the 
town, and see what dimensions it was of, and if they 
might venture upon it or no. 

UTiey did so, and despeiately resolved that they 
would venture upon them , but while thw were ani- 
mating one another to the work, three of them that 
were a little liefore the rest colled out aloud to 


them, and told them they had found Tom Jeffery ; 
they all ran up to the place , and so it was indera, 
for there they found the poor fellow, hanged up 
naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was 
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found 
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians who had 
been concerned in the fray with us before*, and two 
or three of them wounded with our shot , and our 
men found they were awake, and talking one to 
another in that house, but knew not theii number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en- 
raged them, as before, that they swore to one 
another they would be revenged, and that not an 
Indian who came into their hands should have quar- 
ter ; and to work they went immediately, and yet not 
[ 198 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


so madly as by the ra^ and fury they were in mi^ht 
be expected. Their first care was to get something 
that would soon take fire ; but after a little search 
they found that would be to no purpose, for most 
of the houses were low, and thatched with flags or 
rushes, of which the country is full ; so they pres- 
ently made some wild-fire, as we call it, by wetting a 
little powder in the palms of their hands ; and in a 
quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four 
or five places, and particularly that house where the 
Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the fire 
began to blaze, the poor flighted creatures bej^an to 
rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate 
ill the attempt, and especially at the door, wliere 
they drove them back, toe boatswain himself killing 
one or two with his pole-axe , the house being large, 
and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called 
for a hand-grenade, and threw it among them, which 
at first frighted them ; but when it burst made such 
havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous 
manner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the house were killed or hurt with the gren- 
ade, except two or three more, who pressed to the 
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with 
their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and 
despatched all who came that way. But there was 
another apartment in the house, where the prince, 
or king, or whatever he was, and several other, were ; 
and these they kept in till the house, which was by 
this time all of a light flame, fell in upon them, and 
they were smothered or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they 
would not waken the people faster than they could 
master them ; but the fire began to waken them fast 
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies ; for the fire grew so raging, all 
[ 199 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the houses heine made of light combustihle stuff, 
that they could hardly bear the street between them, 
and their business was to follow the iiie for the surer 
execution. As fast as the fire either forced the people 
out of those houses which were burning, or flighted 
them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still calling and 
hallooing to one another to remember Thomas Jeffery. 

While this was doing I must confess I was very 
uneasy, and especially w’hen I saw the flames of 
the town, which, it being night, seemed to be just 
by me. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his 
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not 
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
was in ; especially hearing the guns too, for by this 
time they began to use their firearms. A thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the 
supercarm, what should become of us ; and at last, 
though he could ill spare any more men, yet, not 
knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes 
another boat, and with tliirtecn men and himself 
come on shore to me. 

He was snrprised to see me and the sufiercargo in 
the boat with no more than two men ; and though 
he was glad that we wei'e well, yet he was in the 
same impatience with us to know what was doing ; 
for the noise continued, and the flame increased. In 
shoi't, it was next to an impossibility for any men in 
the world to restrain their curiosity to know what 
had happened, or their concern for the safety of the 
men. In a word, the captain told me he would go 
and help his men, let what would come. I aigued 
with him, os I did before with the men, the safety 
of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest 
of the owners and merchants, &c., and told him I 
would go, and the two men, and only see if we could. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


at a distance, learn what was like to be the event, 
and come back and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to ray nephew, as it was to 
talk to the rest before ; he would go, he said, and he 
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for 
he could not think of having his men lost for want 
of help ; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and 
his life and all, and away went he. 

In a word, I was no more able to stay behind now 
than I was to persuade them not to go ; so, in short, 
the captain oraered two men to row back the pin- 
nace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long- 
boat at an anchor ; and that when they came back 
six men should keep the two boats, and six more 
come after us, so that he left only sixteen men in 
the ship ; for the whole ship's company consisted of 
sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the last 
quai'i'el which brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt 
little of the ground we trod on ; and being guided 
by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the 
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns were 
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people 
were now of quite another nature, and filled us with 
horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking 
a city, or at the taking a town by storm. I had 
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ire- 
land, and killing man, woman, and child ; and I had 
read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebui^, 
and cutting the throats of 22,000 of all sexes ; but 
I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is 
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was 
upon our minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to the 
town, though there was no entering the streets of it 
for the fire. The fimt object we met with was the 
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for 
[201 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the house was consumed ; and just before it, plain 
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men 
and three women killed ; and, as we thought, one or 
two more lay in the heap among the fire. In short, 
there were such instances of a rage altogether bar- 
barous, and of a fury something beyona what was 
human, that we thought it impossible our men could 
be guilty of it ; or if they were the authois of it, we 
thought thw ought to be every one of them put to 
the worst of deaths. But this was not all , we saw 
the fire increased forward, and the cry went on just 
as the fire went on, so that we were in the utmost 
confusion. We advanced a little way farther, and 
behold, to our astonishment, three women naked, and 
crying in a most dreadful manner, come flying as if 
they had indeed had wings, and after them sixteen 
or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and 
consteniation, with three of our English butchers, 
for Lean call them no better, in their rear, who when 
they could not overtake them fired in among them, 
and one that was killed by their shot fell ^wn in 
our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be 
their enemies, and that we would murder them as 
well as those that pursued them, they .set up a most 
dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of 
them fell down as if already dead with the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and m\ blood ran 
chill in my veins when I .saw this; and I believe had 
the three English sailors that pursued them come on, 
I had made our men kill them all. However, we 
took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know 
that we would not hurt them, and immediately they 
came up to us, and kneeling down, with theii hands 
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save 
them, which we let them know we would; where- 
upon they crept all together in a huddle close behind 
us as for protection. I left my men drawn up to- 
[ 202 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

gether, and charged them to hurt nobody, but if 
possible to get at some of our people, and see what 
devil it was possessed them, ana what they in- 
tended to do ; and in a word, to command them off, 
assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they 
would have a hundred thousand men about their 
eel's ; I say, I left them and went among those flying 
people^ taking only two of our men with me ; and 
there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them. 
Some of them had their feet terribly burnt with 
trampling and running through the Are, others their 
hands burnt. One of the women had fallen down in 
the fire, and was very much burnt before she could 
get out again , and two or three of the men had cuts 
III their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; 
and another was shot through the body, and dira 
while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all 
this was, but I could not understand one word they 
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them 
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was 
so terrified in iny thoughts at this outrageous at- 
tempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to 
my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of 
the town through the fire, or whatever might be in 
the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would. 
Accordingly, as soon as I came back to my men, I 
told them my resolution, and commanded them to 
follow me, when in the very moment came four of 
our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving 
over the heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered 
with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people 
to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud 
as they could halloa, and with much ado one of them 
made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and 
came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a 
[SOS] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


halloo, like a shout of tnutnph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come; and without bearing to hear 
oie, “ Captain," s^s he, noble captain, I am glad 
you are come ! We have not half done yet, villain- 
ous hell-hound dogs ! I 'll kill as many of them as 
poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have sworn 
to spare none of them ; we '11 root out the very 
nation of them from the earth." And thus he ran 
on, out of breath, too, with action, and would not 
give us^leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him 
a little, “ Barbarous dc^ ! " said 1, “ what are you 
doing ? I won't have one creature touched more 
upon pain of death. I charge you upon your life to 
stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a 
dead man this minute." 

“ Why, sir," says he, “ do you know what you do, 
or what they have done ? If you want a reason for 
what we have done, come hither ; " and with that he 
showed me the poor feUow hanging with his throat 
cut. 

I confe.ss I was urged then myself, and at another 
time would have been forward enough , but I thought 
they had carried their rage too far, and I thought 
of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, “Cursed 
be their anger, for it was fieix£ ; and their wrath, for 
it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my 
hands ; for when the men I earned with me saw the 
sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain 
them as I should have had with the others ; nay, my 
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in 
their hearing that he was only concerned for fear of 
the men being overpowered ; for as to the people, he 
thought not one of them ought to live ; for they had 
all glutted themselves with the muider of the poor 
man, and that they ought to be used like murderers. 
Upon these words away ran eight of my men with 
[ 204 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the boatswain and his crew to complete their bloody 
work; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to 
restrain them, came away pensive and sad, for I could 
not bear the sight, much less £he horrible noise and 
cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the 
supercargo and two men, and with these I walked 
back to the lioats. It was a very great piece of folly 
in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for 
os it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had 
run over the country, there stood above forty men 
armed with lances and bows at the little place where 
the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned be- 
fore ; but by accident I missed the place, and came 
directly to the seaside , and by the time I got to the 
seaside it was broad day. Immediate^ I took the 
. pinnace and went aboard, and sent her oack to assist 
the men in what might happen. 

I observed about the time that I came to the boat- 
side that the fire was pretty well out, and the noise 
abated ; but in about half-an-hour after I got on 
board I heard a volley of our men’s firearms, and 
saw a great smoke , this, as I underetood afterwards, 
was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, 
stood at the few houses on the way ; of whom they 
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those houses 
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or 
children. 

By that time the men got to the shore again with 
the pinnace our men began to appear; they came 
dropping in some and some, not in two bodies, and 
in torm, as they went, but all in heaps, straggling 
here and there in such a manner that a small force 
of resolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole 
countiy ; and the men were amazed and surprised, 
and so ftighted, that I believe a hundred of them 
[ 206 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


would have fled at the sight of but five of our men. 
Nor in all this terrible action was there a man who 
made any considerable defence ; they were so sur- 
prised between the terror of the Are, and the sudden 
attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not 
which way to turn themselves ; for if they fled one 
way, they were met by one party , if back again, by 
another: so that they were every^^here knocked 
down. Nor did any of our men receive the least 
hurt, except one, who strained his foot, and another 
had one or his hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, 
and indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular, as well for his acting so out of his 
duty as commander of the ship, and having the 
charge of the vovage upon him, as in his prompting 
rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody* 
and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me 
very I'espectfully, but told me that when he saw the 
body” of the poor seaman whom they had murdered 
in such a cruel and barbarous manner he was not 
master of himself, neither could he govern his pas- 
sion. He owned he should not have done so, as he 
was commander of the ship ; but as he was a man, 
and nature moved him, he could not bear it. As 
for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me 
at all, and they knew it well enough, so thej took 
no notice of niy dislike. 

The next day we set .sail, so we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed ; some said one thing, some 
another; but according to the best of their ac- 
counts, put all together, they killed or destroyed 
about one hundred and fifty people, men, women, 
and children, and left not a house standing in the 
town. 

As for the poor fellow, Tho. Jeffery, as he was 
[S06] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head 
was half off, it would do him no service to bring 
him away ; so they left him where they found him, 
only took him down from the tree where he was 
hanged by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was 
against them in it, and I always after that time told 
them God would blast the voyage; for I looked 
upon all the blood they shed that night to be mur- 
der in them ; for though it is true that they had 
killed Tho. Jeffery, yet it was as true that Jeflery was 
the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated 
or demiuched a young woman of theirs, who came 
down to them innocently, and on the faith of their 
public capitulation. 

The faioatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said it is true that 
we seemed to break the truce, but really had not, 
and that the war was begun the night before by the 
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed 
one of our men without any just provocation ; so 
that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we 
might also be in a capacity to do ouiwelves justice 
upon them in an extraordinary manner; that though 
the poor man had taken a little liberty with a 
wench, he ought not to have been 'murdered, and 
that in such a villainous manner ; and that they did 
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of 
God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to 
have warned us against going on shore among 
heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to 
make mankind wise but at their own experience; 
and their experience seems to be always of most use 
to them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and 
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to 
[ 207 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


touch at Surat; but the chief of the supercai^’s 
design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he missed 
of his business outward-bound he was to go up to 
China, and retura to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of 
Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore on 
the Arabian side of the gulf were surrounded by the 
Arabians, and either all killed or cairied away into 
slavery ; the rest of the boat’s crew were not able to 
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their 
boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retri- 
bution of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain 
very warmly told me he thought I went farther in 
my censures than I could snow any warrant for 
in Scripture, and referred to the 18th of St. Luke, 
verse 4, where our Saviour intimates that those men 
on whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinnera 
above all the Galileans , but that which indeed put 
me to silence in the case was, that not one of these 
five men who were now lost were of the number of 
those who went on shore to the massacre of Mada- 
gascar (so I always called it, though our men could 
not bear the woixl massacre with any patience) ; and, 
indeed, this last ciicumstance, os I have said, put me 
to silence for the present. 

But my frwjuent preaching to them on this sub- 
ject had w oi-se consequences than I expected , and 
the boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me ne 
found that I continually bi ought that afikir upon 
the stage, that I made unjust reflections upon it, 
and had used the men very ill on that account, and 
himself in particular ; that as I was but a passenger, 
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the 
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it , that they 
did not know but I might have some ill design in 
my head, and perhaps to call them to account for it

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

when they came to England; and that, therefore, 
unless I would resolve to .lave done with it, and also 
not to concern myself farther with him, or any 
of his affairs, he would Jca<'e the ship ; for he did not 
think it was safe to ''ail with me among them. 

I heard him ^o^■<^lltiv enough till he had done, 
and then told him that 1 did confess I had all along 
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would 
always call it; and that I had on all occasions 
spoken my mind fieely about it, though not more 
upon him than any of the rest ; that as to my having 
no command in the ship, that was true, nor did I 
exercise any authority, only took my liberty of 
speaking my mind in things which publicly con- 
cerned us all ; and what concern I had in the voyage 
was none of his business , that I was a considerable 
owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I 
had a right to speak, even farther than 1 had yet 
done, and would not be accountable to him or any 
one else ; and began to be a little warm with him. 
He made but little reply to me at that time, and I 
thought that affair had been over. We were at 
this time in the road at Bengal ; and being willing 
to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo 
in the ship’s boat to divert myself; and towaras 
evening was preparing to go on hoard, when one of 
the men came to me, and told me he would not have 
me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for 
they had oixiers not to carry me on board any more. 
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so 
insolent a messaige ; and 1 asked the man who bade 
him deliver that errand to inep He told me the 
coxswain I said no more to the fellow, but bade 
him let them know he had delivered his message, 
and that 1 had given him no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo 
and told him the story, adding what 1 presently {on<

aaw, viz., that there would certainly be a mutiny in the 
ship, and entreated him to go immediately on board 
the ship in an Indian boat, and acciuaint the cap- 
tain of it. But I might have spared tins intelligence, 
for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter 
was effwited on board. The boatswain, the gunner, 
the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior officers, 
as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came up to the 
quarter-deck and desired to speak with the captain ; 
and there the boatswain making a long harangue, fur 
the fellow talked very well, and repeating all he had 
said to me, told the captain in a few uoids that as I 
was now gone peaceably on shore, they w ere loath to 
use any violence with me ; which if I had not gone 
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige 
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell 
him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the 
ship under his command, they would perform it well 
ana faithfully ; but if 1 would not quit the ship, or 
the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave 
the ship, and sail no farther with him , and at that 
word “ all,” he turned his face about towards the 
mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agieed on 
between them, at which all the seamen being got 
together they cried out, “One and all, one and all' ” 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and 
of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur- 
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly that he would consider of the thing, 
but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken 
to me about it. He used some arguments with them 
to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of 
the tiling, but it was all in vain , they swore, and 
shook hands round, before his face, that they would 
go all on shore unless he would engage to them not 
to suffer me to come any more on Board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew hi.<>

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; bo he began to talk cavalierly to them ; 
told them that I was a very considerable owner of 
the ship, and that in justice he could not put me 
out of my own house ; that this was next door to 
serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who 
made the mutiny in a ship, set the captain on shore 
in an uninhabited island, and mn away with the 
ship ; that let them go into what ship they would, 
if ever they came to England again it would cost 
them dear; that the ship was mine, and that he 
could not put me out of it; and that he would 
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than dis- 
oblige me so much ; so they might do as they 
pleased. However, he would go on shore, and talk 
with Aie oh shore, and invited the boatswain to go 
with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the 
matter with me. 

But they all rejected the proposal, and said they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither 
on board or on shore; and if I came on boaid, they 
would all go on shore. “ Well," said the captain, 
if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and 
talk with him ; " so away he came to me with this 
account, a little after the message had been brought 
to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew I must confess, 
for I was not without apprehensions that they would 
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with 
the ship ; and then I had been stripped naked, in a 
remote country, and nothing to Wlp myself; in 
short, I had been in a worse case than when I was 
all alone in the island. 

But they had not come that length, it seems, to 
my gi'eat satisfaction ; and when my nephew told me 
what they had said to him, and how they had swam, 
and shook hands, that they would one and all leave 
[ 211 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the ship if I was suiFered to come on board, I told 
him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I 
would stay on shore. I only desired he would take 
care and send me all my necessary things on shore, 
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would 
find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew ; but 
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it. 
So, in short, he went on board the ship again, and 
satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their 
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on 
board the ship. So that matter was over in a very 
few hours ; the men returned to their duty, and I 
b^an to consider what course I should steer. 

I was now alone in the remotest part of the world, 
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thou- 
sand leagues, by sea, farther off from England than 
I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might travel 
here ,by land over the Great Mogul’s country to 
Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up 
the Gulf of Persia, and from thence might take the 
way of the caravans over the desert of Arabia to 
Aleppo and Scanderoon, from thence by sea again 
to Itjy, and so overland into France ; and this, put 
together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the 
globe ; but if it were to be measured, I suppose it 
would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait 
for some English ships which were coming to Bengal 
from Acheen, on the island of Sumatra, and get pas- 
sage on board them for England ; but as I came 
hither without any concern with the English East 
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from 
hence without their licence, unless with great favour 
of the captains of the ships, or of the Company’s 
factors ; and to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


contraries, to see the ship sail without me ; a treat- 
ment, 1 think, a man in m}' circumstances scarce 
ever met with, except from pirates running away 
with a ship, and setting those that would not agree 
with their villainy on shore ; indeed, this was next 
door to it .both ways. However, my nephew left me 
two servants, or rather, one companion and one ser- 
vant ; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he en- 
gaged to go with me, and the other was his own 
servant. I took me also a good lodging in the 
houie of an Englishwoman, where several merchants 
lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, 
and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely 
enough entertained ; and that I might not be said 
to run rashly upon anything, 1 stayed here above 
nine months, considering what course to take, and 
how to manage myself. I had some English goods 
with me of vuuc, and a considerable sum of money ; 
my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occa- 
sion, that I niiglit not be straitened, whatever might 
happen. I quickly disposed of my goods, and to 
advantage too , and as I originally intended, I 
bought here some very good diamonds, which, of aU 
other things, was the most proper for ine in my 
present circumstances, because I might always carry 
my whole estate about me. 

After a long stav here, and many proposals made 
for my return to England, but none falling out to 
my mind, the English merchant who lodged with 
me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate 
acquaintance, came to me one morning. Country- 
man,” says he, “ 1 have a project to communicate 
to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, 
for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you 
shall have thoroughly considered it. 

Here we are posted,” says be, “ you by accident,

and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very 
remote froth our own country ; but it is in a country 
where, by us who understand trade and business, a 
great daal of money is to be got. If you will put a 
thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will 
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; 
you shall be captain, I 'll be merchant, and we will 
go a trading voyage to China ; for what should we 
stand still for? The whole wot Id is in motion, roll- 
ing round and round ; all the creatures of God, 
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent , 
why should we be idle ^ There arc no drones in 
the world, but men ; why should we be of that 
number ? ” 

I liked his proposal very well ; and the more be- 
cause it seemra to be expressed with so much good 
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say 
but that I might, by my loose and unhinged circuni- 
staoces, be the fitter to embrace a proposal for 
trade, or indeed for anything else; whereas other- 
wise, trade was none of my element. However, I 
might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade 
was not my element, rambling was ; and no proposal 
for .seeing any part of the world which I never had 
seen before, could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a 
ship to our minds ; and when we had got a vessel, it 
was not easy to get English sailors ; that is to say, 
so many as were necessary to govern the voyAge, and 
manage the sailors which we should pick up there. 
After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a 
gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Port- 
uguese foremastmen , with these we found we could 
do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they 
are, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have wrote the 
history' of their voyages and travels this way, that it 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


would be very little diversion to anybody to give a 
long account of the places we went to, and the 
people who inhabit there. Those things I leave to 
others, and refer the reader to those journals and 
travels of Englishmen, of which many I find are 
published, and more promised every day. 'Tis 
enough to me to tell you that I made this voyage to 
Aehecn, in the island of Sumatra, and from thence 
to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for 
opium, and some arrack ; the first a commodity 
which bears a great price among the Chinese, and 
which, at that time, was very much wanted there ; 
in a word, we went up to Suskan, made a very great 
voyage, were eight months out, and returned to 
Bengal, and I was very well satisfied with my 
adventure. 

I observe, that our people in England often ad- 
mire how the officers wnich the Company send into 
India, and the merchants which generally stay there, 
get such very great estates as they do, and some- 
times come home worth sixty to seventy and a hun- 
dred thousand pounds at a time. But it is no 
wonder, or at least w-e shall see so much farther into 
it, when we consider the innumerable ports and 
places where they have a free commerce, that it will 
then be no wonder ; and much less will it be so when 
we consider, at all those places and poits where the 
English ships come, there is so much and such con- 
stant demand for the growth of all other countries, 
that there is a certain vent for the returns, as well 
as a market abroad for the goods carried out. 

In short, we made a veiy good voyage, and I got 
so much money by the first adventure, and such an 
insight into the method of getting more, that had I 
been twenty years younger I should have been 
tempted to nave stayra here, and sought no farther 
for making my fortune. But what was all this to a 
ffilS] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a 
restless desire of seeing the world, than a covetous 
desire of getting in it? And indeed I think 'tis 
with great justice that I now call it a restless desire, 
for it was so. When I was at home, I was restless 
to go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was restless 
to be at home. I say, what gain was this to me ? 
I was rich enough, nor had I any uneasy desires 
about getting more money ; and therefore the prof- 
its of the voyage to me were things of no great 
force for the prompting me forwaitl to farther under- 
takings , and I thought that by this voyage I had 
made no progress at all, because I was come back, as 
I might call it, to the place f^om whence 1 came, as 
to a home , w hereas my eye, which, like that which 
Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing, 
was still more desirous of w-andering and seeing, I 
was^ come into a part of the world which I w as never 
in before, and that part in particularly hich I had heard 
much of, and wa.s resolved to see as much of as I 
could, and then I thought I might say I had seen all 
the world that was worth seeing. 

But ray fellow-traveller and I had different 
notions. I do not name this to insist upon my own, 
for I acknowledge his were the most just, and the 
most suited to the end of a merchant’s life, who, 
when he is abroad upon adventuics, ’tis his w isdom 
to stick to that as the best thing for him, which he 
is like to get the most money by. My new friend 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would 
have been content to have gone, like a earner’s 
horse, always to the same inn, backward and forward, 
provided he could, as he called it, find his account in 
it ; on the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad 
rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing twice 
over. 

[ 216 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un- 
settled resolution imaginable which way to go. In 
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the search for business, proposed 
another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and 
to bring home a loading of cloves fram the Manillas, 
or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, the Dutch do 
trade, but islands belonging partly to the Spaniards ; 
though we went nut so far, but to some other, where 
they have not the whole jiower, as they have at 
Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing 
for this voyage ; the chief difficulty was in bringing 
me to come into it. However, nothing else offer- 
ing, and finding that really stirring about and trad- 
ing, the profit being so great, and, as I may say, 
certain, had more pleasure in it, and more satis^tioii 
to the mind, than sitting still, which, to me espe- 
cially, was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on 
this voyage too, which we made very successfully, 
touching at Borneo and several islands, whose names 
[ do not remember, and came home in about five 
months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, 
and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who 
cai Tied them away for the gulf ; and making near five 
of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled 
at me. “ Well, now,” said he, with a sort of agree- 
able insult upon my indolent temper, “is not this 
better than walking about here, like a man of noth- 
ing to do, and spending our time in staring at the 
nonsense and ignorance of the pagans?” “Why 
truly,” says I, “ my friend, I think it is, and I begin 
to be a convert to the principles of merchandising ; 
but I must tell you,” said I, “ by the wAy, you do 
not know what I am a-doing ; for if once 1 conquer 
my backwardness, and embwk heartily, as old as I 
[ 817 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


am, I shall harass you up and down the world till 
I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall 
never let you lie still.” 

But to be short with my speculations. A little 
while after this there came in a Dutch ship from 
Batavia , she was a coaster, not an European trader, 
and of about two hundred tons burden , the men, as 
they pretended, having been so sickly, that the cap- 
tain nad not men enough to go to sea with. He 
lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, got money 
enough, or being willing for other reasons to go for 
Europe, he gave public notice that he would sell his 
ship. This came to my ears before my new partner 
hei^ of it, and I had a great mind to buy it ; so I 
goes home to him, and told him of it. He considered 
awhile, for he was no rash man cither , but musing 
some tune, he replied, “She is a little too big; but, 
however, we will have her.” Acfordingly we bought 
the «hip ; and agreeing with the master, we paid for 
her, and took posses.sion. When we had done so, we 
re.solved to entertain the men, if we could, to join 
them with those we had, for the pursuing our busi- 
ness ; but on a sudden, they having received not 
their wages, but their share of the money, not one 
of them was to be founcL We inquiied much about 
them, and at length were told that they were all 
gone together, by land, to Agra, the gieat city of 
the Mogul’s residence; and from thence were to 
travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, 
as that I inihsed the opportunity of going with them ; 
for such a ramble I thought, and in such company as 
would both have guarded me and diverted me, would 
have suited mightily with my great design ; and I 
should both have seen the world, and gone home- 
wards too. But I was much better satisfied a few 
days after, when I came to know w'hat sort of fellow's 
[ 218 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


they were ; for, in short, their history was, that this 
man they called captain was the gunner only, not the 
commander ; that they had been a trading voyage, 
in which they were atta<-ked on shora by some of the 
Malayans, who had killed the captain and three of 
his men ; and that after the captain was killed these 
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away 
with the ship, which they did, and brought her in at 
the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men 
more on shore ; of whom we shall hear further. 

Well, let them pome by the ship how they would, 
we came honestly by her, as we thought , though we 
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as 
we ought; for we never inquired anything of the 
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly 
have faltered in their account, contradicted one an- 
other, and perhaps contradicted themselves ; or, one 
how or other, we should have seen reason to have 
suspected them. But the man showed us a bill of 
sale for the ship to one Emanuel Clostershovcn, or 
some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, 
and called himself by that name; and we could not 
contradict him ; and being withal a little too un- 
wary, or at least having no suspicion of the thing, 
we went through with our bargain. 

We picked up some more English seamen here 
after this, and some Dutch, and now we resolved 
for a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c., 
that IS to say, among the Philippine and Malacca 
Isles , and in short, not to fill this port of my story 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark- 
able, I spent, from first to lost, six years in this 
country, trading from port to port, backward and 
forward, and with very good success ; and was now 
the last year with niy new partner, going in the ship 
above-mentioned, on a voyage to 'China, but design- 
ing flrst to Siam, to buy rice. 

[ 219 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
and among the islands, we were no sooner 
got clear of those difficult seas, but we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our industry, to find it out where it was. This 
forced us to make for some port , and my partner, 
who knew the country better than I did, directed 
the captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for 
I had made the English mate, one Mr. 'rhompson, 
captain, not being willing to take the charge of two 
ships upon myself. This river lies on the north 
side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to 
Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on shore for 
refreshment, them comes to me one day an English- 
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner’s mate on 
board an English East India ship, which rode in 
the^me river, up at or near the city of Cambodia. 
What brought him hither, we know not , but he 
comes up to me, and speaking in English, “ Sir," 
says he, " you are a stranger to me, and I to you ; 
but I have something to tell you, that very nearly 
concerns you." 

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought 
at first I had known him, but I did not. “If it 
very nearly concerns me,” said I, “ and not yourself, 
what moves you to tell it me ? ” — “I am moved," 
says he, “ by the imminent danger you are in ; and, 
for ought I see, you have no knowl^ge of it.” — “I 
know no danger I am in," said I, “ but that my 
ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out , but I pur- 
pose to lay her aground to-moiTow, to see if I can 
find it.” — “ But, sir,” says he, “ leaky or not leaky, 
find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay 
your ship on shore to-inorrow, when you hear what 
1 have to say to you. Do you know, sir,” said he, 
[ 220 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

“the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues 
up this river? And there are two large English 
ships about five leagues on this side, and three 
Dutch.” — “Well,” said I, “and what is that to 
me !' ” — “ Why, sir,” said he, “ is it for a mao that 
is upon such adventures as you are upon to come 
into a port and not examine first what ships there 
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them P 
I suppose you do not think you are a match for 
them P” I was amused very much at his discourse, 
but not amazed at it, for 1 could not conceive what 
he meant. I turned shoi-t upon him, and said, “ Sir, 
I wish you would explain yourself ; I cannot imagine 
what reason I have to be afraid of any company of 
ships, or Dutch ships , I am no interloper ; what 
can they have to say to me ^ ” 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased ; 
and pausing awhile, but smiling, “ Well, sir,” said 
he, “if you think yourself secure, you must take 
your chance. I am sorry your fate should blind 
you against good advice ; but assure yourself if you 
do not put to sea immediately, you will the very 
next tide be attacked by five longboats full of men ; 
and perhaps, if you are taken, you will be hanged 
for a pirate, and the particular be examined after- 
wards. I thought, sir,” added he,*“l should have 
met with a better reception than this for doing you 
a piece of service of such importance.” — “I can 
never be ungrateful,” said I, “ for any service, or to 
any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is past 
my comprehension,” said I, “ what they should have 
such a design upon me for. However, since you 
say there is no time to be lost, and that there is 
some villainous design in hand against me, I 'll go 
on board this minute, and put to sea immediately, 
if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim 
without stopping it ; but, sir,” said I, “ shall I go 
[«*1] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


away ignorant of the reason of all this ? Can you 
give me no farther light into itP" 

“ I can tell you but part of the story, sir,* says 
he ; but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and 
I believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest ; 
but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the 
story is this, the first part of which, I suppose, you 
know well enough, viz., that you was with tnis ship at 
Sumatra ; that there your captain was murdered by 
the Malayans, with three of his men; and that y;>u, or 
some of those who were on board with you, ran away 
with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the 
sum of the story, and you will be all seized as pirates, 
I can assure you, and executed with very little cere- 
mony ; for you know merchant-ships show but little 
law to pirates, if they get them into their power.* 

“ Now you speak plain English,* said I, “ and I 
thank you ; and though I know nothing that we have 
done like what you talk of, but am sure we ‘came 
honestly and fairly by the ship, yet seeing such work 
is a-doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean 
honestly, I ’ll be upon my guard.” — “ Nay, sir,* says 
he, “ do not talk of being upon your guara ; the best 
defence is to be out of the danger. If you have any 
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men, put 
out to sea without fail at high-water ; and as you 
have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too 
far out before they can come down, for they come 
away at high-water , and as they have twenty miles 
to come, you get near two hours of them by the 
difference of the tide, not reckoning the len^h of 
the way ; besides, as they are only boats, and not 
ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to 
sea, especially if it blows.* 

“ Well,* says I, “you have been very kind in this ; 
what shall I do for you to make you amends?* — 
“ Sir,* says he, “ you may not be so willing to make 

[2Sa] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


me any amends, because you may not convinced 
of the truth of it. I'll make an offer to you. I 
have nineteen months' pay due to me on b<»rd the 

ship , which I came out of England in ; and 

the Dutchman that is with me has seven montLs' 
pay due to him ; if you will make good our pay to 
us, we will go along with you ; and if you find no 
more in it, we will desire no more ; but if we do con- 
vince you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, 
and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the 
rest to you.” 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately 
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as 1 
came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on 
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to 
me with a great deal of joy, “ O ho ! O ho ! we have 
stopped the leak ! we have stopped the leak ! '' — 
“ Say you so ? ” said I ; “ thank God ! but weigh 
the— anAor immediately.” — “Weigh!” says he; 
“ what oo you mean by that ? What is the mat- 
ter ? ” says he. — “ Ask no questions,” says I, “ but 
all hands to work, and weigh without losing a 
minute.” He was surpnsed ; but, however, he called 
the captain, and he immediately onlered the anchor 
to be got up , and though the tide was not quite 
done, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out 
to sea Then I called him into the cabin, and told 
him the story at large ; and we called in the men, 
and they told us the rest of it. But as it took us up 
a great deal of time, so before we had done a seaman 
comes to the cabin door, and calls out to us, 
that the captain bade him tell us we were chased. 
“Chased'” said I; “by whom,%nd by what?” — 
“ By five sloops, or boats,” says the fellow, “ full of 
men.” — “ Very well,” said I , “ then it is apparent 
there is something in it.” In the next place, I 
ordered all our men to be called up, and toM them

that (here was a design to seize the ship, and to take 
tis for pirates, and asked them if they w'ould stand 
by us, and by one another? The men answered 
cheerfully tliat, one and all, they would live and die 
with us. Then I asked the captain what wav he 
thought best for us to manage the fight with them, 
for resist them I was resolvea we would, and that to 
the last drop. He said readily, that the way was to 
keep them off witli our great shot as long as we 
could, and then to fire at them with our small anns 
as long as we could , but when neither of these would 
do any longer, we should retire to our dose quarters ; 

E erhaps they had not materials to break open our 
ulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the meantime, order to bring 
two guns to bear fore and aft out of the steerage, 
to clear the deck, and load them with musket- 
bullets and small pieces of old iron, and what next 
came to hand, and thus we made ready for fight; 
but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind 
enough, and could see the boats at a distance, being 
five large longboats, following us with all the sau 
they could make. ■* 

Two of these boats, which by our glasses w^e could 
see were English, outsailed the rest, and were near 
two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us con- 
siderably, so that we found they would come up with 
us; upon which w'c fired a gun without ball, to 
intimate that they should bring to ; and we put out 
a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they kept 
crowding after us till they came within shot, when we 
took in our white flag, they having made no answer 
to it, hung out a red flog, and fired at them with a 
shot Notwithstanding this they came on till they 
were near enough to call to them with a speaking- 
trumpet, which we had on board; so we called to 
them, and bid them keep off at their peril. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeav- 
oui'ed to come under our stem, so to board us on 
our quarter ; upon which, seeing they were resolute 
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that 
followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so 
that they lay upon our broadside, when immediately 
we fired five guns at them, one of which had been 
levelled so true as to carry away the stem of the 
hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of 
taking down their sail, and running all to the head 
of the boat to keep her from sinking. So she lay 
by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremost 
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her 
in particular 

While this was doing, one of the thi'ee boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out 
the men. We called again to the foremost boat, and 
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her business with us, but had no answer : only 
she crowded close under our stem. Upon this our 
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his 
two chase-guns, and fired again at her ; but the 
shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved 
their caps, and came on. But the gunner, getting 
(quickly ready again, fired among them the second 
time, one shot of which, though it missed the boat 
itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily 
see had done a great deal of niischief among them ; 
but wc, taking no notice of that, wared the ship again, 
and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and 
firing three guns more, we found the boaf was split 
almost to pieces; in particular, her mdder, and a 

i iiece of her stem, were shot quite away ; so they 
landed their sail immediately, and were in great 
disorder ; but to complete their misfortune our 
voi. n. — 1$ [ 226 3 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


gunner let flj two guns at them again ; where he 
nit them we could not tell, but we found the boat 
was sinking, and some of the men already in the 
water. Upon this I im mediately manned out our pin- 
nace, which we had kept close by our side, with oraers 
to pick up some of the men, if they could, and save 
them from drowning, and immediately to come on 
board with them, b^use we saw the rest of the 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace 
followed their orders, and took up three men ; one 
of which was just drowning, and it was a good while 
before we could recover him. As soon as they were 
on board we crowded all the sail we could make, and 
stood farther out to sea ; and we found that when 
the other three boats came up to the first two, they 
gt^ye over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though 
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we 
wduld change our course, and not let anyone imagine 
whither we were going ; so we stood out to sea east- 
ward, quite out of the course of all European ship, 
whether they were bound to China, or anywhere else 
within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult 
with the two seamen, and inquire first what the 
meaning of all this should be ? and the Dutchman 
let us into the secret of it at once, telling us that the 
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whose name too he told us, 
though I do not remember, was treacherously mur- 
dered by«the natives on the coast of Malacca, with 
three of his men ; and that he, this Dutchman and 
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered 
about a great while ; till at length he, in prticular, 
in a miraculous manner made his escape, and swam 
[ 226 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


off to a Dutch ship, which sailing near the shore in 
its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for 
fresh water ; that he durst not come to that part of 
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the 
night to take the water farther offj and the ship's 
boat took him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, 
having deserted the rest in their travels ; and gave 
an account that the fellow who had nin away with 
the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which 
were gone a-cruising in her, and that they had al- 
ready taken an English ship and two Dutch ships, 
ve^ richly laden. 

This latter pai-t we found to concern us directly ; 
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my part- 
ner said very well, if we had fallen into their hands, 
and they had had such a prepossession against us 
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have de- 
fended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter 
at their hands ; and especially considering that our 
accusers had been our judges, and that we could 
have expected nothing from them but what rage 
would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion 
liave executed ; and therefore it was his opinion we 
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we 
came, without putting in at any port whatever, be- 
cause there we coula give a good account of our- 
selves, could prove wheio we were when the ship put 
in, whom we bought her of, and the like ; and which 
was more than cill the rest, if we were put to the 
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we 
should be sure to have some justice, and not be 
hanged hrst, aud judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but 
after a little more serious winking, I told him 1 
thought it was a verj' great hazard for us to attempt 
[ 287 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


retumine to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong 
side of the Straits of Malacca , and that if the alarm 
waa given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every 
side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English 
elsewhere ; that if we should be taken, as it were run- 
ning away, we should even condemn ourselves, and 
there would want no more e\idence to destroy us. I 
also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he 
was of my mind, and that we should certainly be 
taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and all 
the ship's company ; and we immediately resolved to 
go away to the coast of Tonqum, and so on to the 
coast o? China ; and pursuing the first design as to 
trade, find some way or other to dispose of ^e ship, 
and come back in some of the vessels of the country, 
such as we could get. This was approved of as the 
best method for our security , ana accoidingly we 
steeped away N.N.E , keeping above fifty leagues off 
from the usual course to the enstw ard. 

This, however, put us to some inconveniences ; for 
first the winds, when we came to the distance firom 
the shore, seemed to be nioie steadily against us, 
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east 
and E.N.E., so that we were a long while upon our 
voyage, and we were bet ill provided with victuals 
for so long a voyage ; and which was still worse, there 
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships, 
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were hound 
that way, might be got in before us ; and if not, 
some other ship bound to China might have infor- 
mation of us from them, and pursue us with the 
same vigour. 

I must confess I was now veiy uneasy, and thought 
myself, including the late escape from the longboats, 
to have been in the most dangerous condition that 
ever I was in through all my past life; for whatever 
[ 2«8 1 



BOBINSON CRUSOE 


ill cirrumstances I bad been in, I was never pursued 
for a thief before ; nor had I ever done anything that 
merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much 
less thievish. I had chiefly been my own enemy ; or, 
as I may rightly say, I had been nobody’s enemy but 
my own. But now I was embaiTassea in the worst 
condition imaginable ; for though I was perfectly in- 
nocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence 
appear ; and if I had been taken, it had been under 
a supposed guilt of the worst kind, at least a crime 
esteemed so among the people I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an escape, 
though which way to do it I knew not, or. what port 
or phu-e we should go to. My partner, seeing me 
thus dejected, though he was the most concenied at 
first, began to encourage me, and describing to me 
the several ports of that coast, told me he wouli^ut 
in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Ton- 
quin ; intending to go afterwards to Macao, a town 
once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where 
still a great many European families resided, and par- 
ticularly the missionary priests usually went thither, 
in order to their going forwai’d to China. 

Hither then wc resolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular course, and veiy 
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight 
of the coast very early in the morning,; and upon 
reflection upon the past circumstances we were in, 
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved 
to put into a small river, which, however, had a 
depth enough bf water for us, and to see if we could, 
either overland or by the ship's pinnace, come to 
know what ships were in any ports thereabouts. 
This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance; for 
though we did nut immediacy see any European 
ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning 
there came into the bay two Dutch ships, and a

bdieved to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two

aM in the afternoon went by two English ships, 
ateering the same course; and thus we thought we 
saw oiuselves beset with enemies, hoth one way or 
other. The place we were in wtu$ wild and barbar- 
ous. the people thieves, even by occupation or pro- 
fession ; and though, it is true, we had not much to 
seek of them, and except getting a few provisions, 
cared not how little we had to do with them, yet it 
was wifh much difficulty that we kept ourselves 
from being insulted by them several ways. 

We were in a small river of tins country, within a 
few leagues of its utmost limits iiorthwaid, and by 
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land 
which o^ns the great hay of Toiujiiin , and it was 
in this oeating up along the shore that we dis- 
covered as above, that in a woitl, we wtne surrounded 
with enemies. The people we were among were the 
most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast, hav- 
ing no correspondence with an) other nation, and 
dealing only in fish and oil, and such guiss commodi- 
ties ; and it may be particularly seen that they are, 
as I said, the most barbarous of any of the inhabi- 
tants, viz., that among other customs they have this as 
one, viz., that if any vessel have the misfortune to be 
shipwrecked upon the coast, they presently make the 
men all prisoners or slaves , and it was nut long be- 
fore we found a spice of tlieir kindness this way, on 
the occMion following. 

I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak 
at sea, and that we could not find it out ; and however 
it bapmned that, as I have said, it was stopped unex- 
pectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized 
by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam, 
yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and 
[ 280 ] 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


sound as we desired, we resolved while we were in 
this place to lay her on shore, take out what heavy 
thingii we had on board, which were not many, and 
to wash and clean her bottom, and if possible to find 
out where the leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the .ship, and 
brought all our guns and other movable things to one 
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; but on second thoughts we did 
not care to lay her dry on ground, neither could we 
find out a proper plate for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with such a sight, came wondering down to the shore 
to look at us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one 
side in such a manner, and heeling in towards the 
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on 
her bottom with stages and with their boats, on the 
off side, they presently concluded that the ship was 
cast away, and so lay fast on the ground. 

On this supposition they came all about us in two 
or three hours’ time, with ten or twelve large boats, 
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the ship ; and if they had found us there, 
to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or 
whatever they call him, for we knew' nothing who was 
their governor. 

When they came up to the ship and began to row 
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on the 
outside of the ship’s bottom and side, washing, and 
graving, and stooping, as every seafaring maa\nows 
how. 

They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their 
dedgn was ; but being willing to be siire, we topk 
this opportunity to get some of us into the sliip, and 
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those 
[231 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that were at work to defend themselves with, if 
there should be occasion ; and it was no more than 
need, for in less than a quarter of an hour’s consul- 
tation they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really 
a wreck ; that we were all at work endeavouring to 
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our 
boats; and when we handed our arms into the 
boats, they concluded by that motion that we were 
endeavouring to save some of our goods. Upon 
this they took it for granted we all belonged to 
them, and away they came don n upon our men, as 
if it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men seeing so many of them began to be 
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, 
and cried out to us to know- what they should do. 
I immediately calle'd to the men who worked upon 
the stage to slip them down and get up the side 
into the ship, and bade those in the boat to row 
round and come on boaid; and those few of us who 
were on board worked with all the strength and 
hands we had to bring the ship to rights ; but, how- 
ever, neither the men upon the stage, or those in 
the boats, could do as they were ordered before the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and two of their 
boats boarded our longboat, and began to lay hold 
of the men as their piisonei-s. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English 
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who having a musket 
in his hand never offered to fire it, but laid it down 
in the boat, like a fool as 1 thought. But he un- 
derstood his business better than I c*ould teach him ; 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their own boat into ours, where 
taking him by the two ears he beat his head so 
against the boat’s gunnel, that the fellow died in- 
stantly in his hands ; and in the meantime a Dutch- 
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and 
[233 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he 
knocked down five of them who attempted to enter 
the boat. But this was doing little towaitls resist- 
ing thirty or forty men, who, fearless, because ig- 
norant of their danger, began to thniw themselves 
into the longboat, where we had but five men in all 
to defend it. But one accident gave our 'men a 
complete victory, which deserved our laughter rather 
than anything else, and that was this. 

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the out- 
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where 
he had caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two 
kettles just let down into the Imat, one filled w'ith 
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and 
oil, and such stuff a.s the shipwrights u.se for that 
work ; and the man that attended the carpenter had 
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup- 
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff. 
Two of the enemy’s men entered tlie boat just where 
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; he im- 
mediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, 
boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. 
The carpenter saw it, and cried out, “Well done. 
Jack, give them some more of it,” and .stepping 
forward himself takes one of their mops, and dip- 
ping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it 
among them so plentifidly, that, in short, of all the 
men in the three boats there was not one that was 
nut scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful 
and pitiful manner, and made such a howling and 
ciying, that I never heard a woi'se noise, and, in- 
deed, nothing like it ; for it is worth observing, that 
though pain naturally makes all people cry out, 
yet eveiw nation has a particular way of exclama- 
tion, and making noises as different from one another 
[ 838 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


as their speech. I cannot give the noise these 
creatures made a better name than howling, nor a 
name more proper to the tone of it ; for I never 
heard anything more like the noise of the wolves 
which, as' I have said, I heard howl in the forest 
on the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I wds never pleased with a victory better in my 
life ; not only as it was a perfect suiprise to me, and 
that our dangei was imminent before, but as we got 
this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man 
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I 
was very much concerned at , for I was sick of kill- 
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in 
my own defence, knowing they came on ei rands 
which they thought just, and knew no better ; and 
that though it may be a just thing, because neces- 
sary, for there is no necessary w ickedness in nature , 
yet I thought it was a sad life in which we must be 
always obliged to lie killing oui fellow -creatures to 
preserve our own, and, indeed, I think so still, and I 
would, even now, suffer a great deal rather than I 
would take away the life even of the person injuring 
me ; and I believe all considering people, who know 
the value of life, would be of my opinion, at least 
they would if they entered seriously into the consid- 
eration of it. 

But to return to my story. All the while this 
was doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest 
of the men on board, had with gi-cat dexterity 
brought the ship almost to rights , and having got- 
ten the guns into their places again, the gunner 
called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for 
he would let flv among them. I called back again 
to him, and bid him not offer to ffre, for the carpen- 
ter would do the work without him, but bade him 
heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was 
on board, took care of. But the enemy was so ter- 
[ 234 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

rified with what they had met with in their first at- 
tack, that they would not come on nji^tn ; and some 
of them that were farthest off seeing the ship swim, 
as it were, upright, begun, as we supposed, to see 
their mistake, aud give over the enterprise, finding 
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of 
this merry fight ; and having gotten some rice and 
some roots and bread, with about sixteen good big 
hogs on board two days befoi-e, we resolved to stay 
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it ; 
fur we made no doubt but we should be surrounded 
the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than 
our pitch-kettle would dispose of tor us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same 
evening, and the next morning were reaily to sail. In 
the meantime, lying at an anchor at some distance, we 
were not so much concerned, being now in a fighting 

f iosture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy 
lad presented. The next day, having finished our 
work within board, and finding our ship was per- 
fectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would 
have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted 
to inform ourselves of what was to be known con- 
cerning the Dutch ships that had been there ; but 
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen 
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little be- 
fore ; so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of For- 
mosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or 
English merchant-ship, as a Dutch or English mer- 
chant-ship in the Mraiterraiiean is of an Algerine 
man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea we kept out N.E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 
Islands, and this we did that we might not fall into 
the way of any of our European ships ; and then we 
steered north till we came to the latitude of SS 
degrees 30 minutes, by which means we made the 
[836] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ifilaad of Formosa directly, where we came to an 
anchor in ordei’ to get water and fresh provisions, 
which the people there, who are very couiteous and 
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly, 
and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in ml 
their agieemeiits and bargains; which is what we 
did not find among other people, and may be owing 
to the remains of Christianity, which was once 
planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, 
and is a testimony of what I have often observed, 
vi/., that the Christian religion alw'ays civilises the 
people and reforms their manners, where it is received, 
whether it works saving effects upon them or no. 

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast 
of China at an e<|ual distance, till we knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China where our European 
ships usually come , being resolved, if possible, not 
to fall into any of their hands, especially in this 
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could 
not fall of being entirely ruined , nay, so great 
was my fear in particular as to my Iwiiig taken 
by them, that I Iwlieve firmly I would much rather 
have chosen to fall into the hands of the Spanish 
Inquisition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 
resolved to put into the first trading port we should 
come at, and standing in for the shore a boat came 
off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot 
on board, who, knowing us to be an European ship, 
came to offer his service, which indeed we were veiy 
glad of, and took him on boaid , upon which, with- 
out asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the 
boat he came in, and sent them back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to 
make the old man carry us whither we would, that 
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the 
Gulf of Nanking, which is the most northern part of 
[2361 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the coast of China. The old man said he knew the 
Gulf of Nanking very well; but smilingi asked us 
what we would do there? 

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase 
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrougnt silks, 
&c., and so would return by the same coarse we 
came. He told us our best port had been to have 
put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of 
a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and might, 
for our money, have purebred all sorts of China goods 
as cheap as we could at Nanking. 

Not oeing able to put the ola man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told 
him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, and 
that we had a mind to go and see the great city of 
Peking, and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. “ Why then," says the old man, “ you should , 
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into 
the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of 
the great canal. This canm is a navigable river, 
which goes through the heart of all that vast empire 
of China, crosses all the rivers, pa.s.scs some consider- 
able hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of Peking, being in length near two 
hundred and seventy leagues.” 

“ Well,” said I, “ Seignior Portuguese, but that is 
not our business now ; the great question is, if you 
can carry us up to the city of Nanking, from whence 
we can travel to Peking afterwards? " Yes, he said 
he could do so very well, and that there was a gi^eat 
Dutch ship gone by that way just before. This gave 
me a little shock ; a Dutch ship was now our terror, 
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least 
if he had not come in too frightful a figure, and we 
depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our 
destruction, for we were in no condition to fight them, 
all the ships they trade with into those parts being 
[ 837 ] 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 

of great burden, and of much greater force than we 
were. 

The old man found me a little confused and under 
some concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said 
to me, “Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of 
the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at war with 
your nation ?" — “ No,” says I, “ that ’s true , but I 
Know not what liberties men may take when they are 
out of the reach of the law.” — “Why," says he, 
“you are no pirates, what need you fear? They 
will not meddle with peaceable merchants, sure.” 

If 1 had any blood in nw body that did not fly up 
into my face at that word, it was hindered by some 
stop in the vessels appointed by Nature to prevent 
it ; for it put me into the greatest disoider and con- 
fusion imaginable ; nor was it possible for me to con- 
ceal it so but that the old man easily perceived it. 

“ Sir,” says he, “ I find you are in some disorder 
in your thoughts at my talli , pray be pleased to to 
which way you think flt, and depend upon it I 'll do 
you all the service I can.” — “ Why, seignior,” said 
1, it is true I am a little unscttlra in my resolu- 
tion at this time whither to go in particular, and I 
am something more so for what you said about 
pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas ; 
we are but in an ill condition to meet with them, for 
you see we have but a small force, and but veiy 
weakly manned.” 

“ Oh sir,” says he, “ do not be concerned ; I do not 
know that there has been any pirates in these seas 
these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I 
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since , but 
you may be assured she is gone to the southwaid ; 
nor was she a ship of any great force, or flt for the 
work ; she was not built tor a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board, 
after the captain and some of his men had been mur-

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


dered by the Malayans at or near the island of 
Sumatra.” 

What ! ” said I, seeming to know nothing of the 
matter, “did they murder the captain?” — “No," 
said he, “ I do not understand that they murder^ 
him , but as they afterwards ran away with the ship, 
it IS generally believed they betrayed him into the 
hands of the Malayans, who did murder him, and, 
perhaps, th^ procured them to do it.” — “ Wh^ 
then,” said I, “they deserve death as much as if 
they had done it themselves.” — “ Nay,” says the old 
man, “they do deserve it, and they will certainly 
have it if they light upon any English or Dutch ship, 
for they have all agreed together that if they meet 
that rogue they will give him no quarter.” 

“ But,” said I to him, “ you say the pirate is gone 
out of thcise seas; how can they meet with him?” 
— “ Why, that is true,” says he, “ they do say so ; 
but he was, as I tell you, in the ^y of Siam, in the 
nver Cambodia, and was discovert there by some 
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were 
left on shore when they ran away with her; and 
some English and Dutch traders tong in the river, 
they were within a little of taking him. Nay,” said 
he, “ if the foremost boats had been well seconded 
by the rest, they had certainly taken him ; but he 
finding only two boats within reach of him, tacked 
about, and fired at these two, and disabled them be- 
fore the others came up ; and then standing off to 
sea, the others were not able to follow him, and so 
he got away. But they have all so exact a descrip- 
tion of the ship, that they will be sure to know him ; 
and wherever they find him, they have vowed to give 
no quarter to either the captain or the seamen, out 
to hang them all up at the yardarm.” 

“ What ! ” says I, “ will they execute them, right 
or wrong ; hang them first, and judge them amr-

wwds?” — “Oh, sir,” sajs the old pilot, “there’s 
no need to make a formal business of it with such 
rogues as those; let them tic them back to back, 
and set them a-diving; it is no more tlian they 
richly deser\e.” 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he 
could do me no harm, so that I turned short upon 
him. “ Well now, seignior,” said I, “ and this is the 
very reason why I would ha\e >ou carry us up to 
Nanking, and not to put biu-k to Macao, or to any 
other part of the country where the English or 
Dutch ships come; for he it known to you, seignior, 
those captains of the English and Dutch ships are a 

C el of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither 
V what belongs to justice, or how to behave 
themsehes as the laws of God and Nature direct; 
but being proud of their offices, and not understand- 
ing their power, they svould act the murderers to 
punish robbers; would take upon them to insult 
men falsely accused, and determine them guilty 
without due inquiry, and perhaps I may live to 
csJl some of them to an account for it, where they 
may be taught how justice is to be executed, and 
that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till 
some evidence may be had of the crime, and tliat he 
18 the man.” 

With this I told him that this was the very ship 
they attacked, and gave him a full account of the 
skirmish we had with their boats, and how' foolishly 
and cow’ard-like they behaved. I told him all the 
story of our buying the ship, and how the Dutch- 
men served us. 1 told him, the reasons I had to 
believe that this story of killing the master by the 
Malayans was not true, as also the running away 
with the ship ; but that it was all a fiction of their 
own to suggest that the men were turned pirates ; 
and they ought to have been sure it was so before

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the^ had ventured to attack us bv surorise, and 
oblige us to resist them; adding, that they would 
have the blood of those men whom we killed there 
in our just defence to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told 
us we were very much in the right to go away to the 
north, and that if he might advise us, it should be 
to sell the ship in China, which we might very well 
do, and buy or build another in the country ; “ and," 
said he, “ though you will not get so good a ship, 
you may get one able enough to carry you and all 
your goods back again to Bengal, or anywhere else." 

I told him I would take his advice when I came to 
any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or 
get' any customer to buy this. He replied, I should 
meet with customers enough for the ship at Nan- 
king, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very 
well to go back again; and that he would procure 
me people both to buy one and sell the other. 

“ Well, but, seignior," says I, “ as you say they 
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow 
your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest 
innocent man into a teirible broil, and perhaps to be 
murdered in cold blood ; for wherever they find the 
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by prov- 
ing this was the ship, and so innocent men may 
probably be overpowered and murdered." — “ Why," 
says the old man, “I will find out a way to prevent 
that also ; for as I know all those commanders you 
speak of very well, and shall see them all as tney 
pass by, I will be sine to set them to rights in the 
thing, and let them know that th^ had been so 
much in the wrong, that though the people who 
were on board at first might run away with the ship, 
yet it was not true that they had turned pirates; 
and that in particular these were not the men that 
first went otr with the ship, but innocently bou^t

ftur believe me as at least to act mor^ cautiously for 
the time to come." — “ Well," says I, “ and will you 
deliver one message to them from me ? ’’ — “ Yes, I 
will," says he, “ if you will give it under your hand 
in writing, that I may be able to prove that it came 
from you, and not out of my own head." I answered 
that I would readily ^ve it him under my hand ; so 
T took a pen and ink and paper, and wrote at large 
the story of assaulting me vith the longboats, &c., 
the pretended reason of it, and ,the unjust cruel 
design of it, and concluded to the commanders that 
they had done what they not only should have been 
ashamed of, but also that if ever they came to Eng- 
land, and I lived to see them there, they should all 
pay dearly for it if the laws of ray country were not 
grown out of use before I arrived there. 

Mv old pilot read this over and over again, and 
asked me several times if I would stand to it. I 
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had any- 
thing left in the world, being sensible that I should 
one time or other find an opportunity to put it 
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to let 
the pilot carry this letter, for he never went back 
again. While those things were passing between us 
by way of discourse, wj went forward directly for 
Nanking, and in about thiiicen days' sail came to an 
anchor at the south-west point of the great gulf of 
Nanking ; where, by the way, I came by accident to 
understand that two Dutem ships were gone the 
length before me, and that I should certainly fall 
into their hands. I consulted my partner again in 
this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, 
and would very gladly have been safe on shore al- 
most anywhere. However, I was not in such per- 
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there 
was no creek or harbour which I might put into,

and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, 
and be in no danger of the enemy. He, told me if 
I would sail to the southward about two and forty 
leagues there was a little port called Quinchang, 
ahere the fathers of the mission usually landed from 
Macao on their progress to tearii the Christian 
religion to the Chinese, and where no European 
ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in there, 
I might consider what farther course to take when I 
was ashore. He confessed, he said, it was not a 
place for merchants, except that at some certain, 
times they had a kind of a fair there, when the 
merchants from Japan came over to buy the Chinese 
merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name 
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell 
wrong, for I do not particularly remember i^ hav- 
ing lost this together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was 
spoiled by the water, on an accident, which I shall 
relate in its order ; but this I remember, that the 
Chinese or Japanese merchants we corresponded with 
called it by a differing name from that which our 
Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it, as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to 
this place, we weighed the next day, having, only 
gone twice ashore, where we were to get fresh water; 
on both which occasions the people of the country 
were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of 
things to sell to us ; I mean of provisions, plants, 
roots, tea, rice, and some foals , but nothing with- 
out money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days ; but it was very much to 
our satisfaction, and I was joyiiil, and I may say 
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolv-

ing, and my partner too, that if it was possible to 
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, 
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would 
never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel 
mure; and indeed I must acknowledge, that of all 
the circumstances of life that ever I had any ex- 
perience of, nothing makes mankind so conipletelv 
miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well 
does the Scripture say, “ 'I'he fear of man brings a 
snare ; ^ it is a life of death, and the mind is so 
entirely suppressed by it, that it is capable of no 
relief ; the animal spirits sink, and all the vigour 
of nature, which usually supports men under other 
afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest 
exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the 
fancy by heightening every danger, leprcsenting the 
English and Dutch captains to be men incapame of 
hearing leason, or of ai.stinguishing between honest 
men and rogues ; or between a story calculated for 
our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpo-e to 
deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole 
voyage, pnigress, and design , for wc might many 
ways have convinced any rea.sonable crtatui'e that we 
were not pirates ; the goods we had on board, the 
course we steered, our frankly showing oui selves, 
and entenng into such and such ports , and even 
our very manner, the foice we had, the number of 
men, the few arms, little ammunition, short piovis- 
ions ; all these would have served to convince any 
men that we were no pirates. The opium and other 
goods we had on board would make it appear the 
.ship had been at Bengal , the Dutchmen, who, it 
was said, had the names of all the men that were in 
the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of 
English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two 
Dutchmen on board. These, and many other par- 
[244 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ticular circumstances, might have made it evident 
to the understanding of any commandert whose 
hands we might fall into, that we were no pirates. 

But fear, that blind useless passion, worked an- 
other way, and threw us into the vapours ; it be- 
wildered our understandings, and set the imagination 
at work to form a thoasand terrible things that, 
perhaps, might never happen. We first supposed, 
as inde^ everybody had related to us, that the sea- 
men on board the English and Dutch ships, but es- 
pecially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of 
a pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats 
and escaping, that they would not give themselves 
leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no, but 
would execute us ofl'hand, as we call it, without giv- 
ing us any room for a defence. We reflected that 
there was really so much apparent evidence before 
them, that they would scarce inquire after any more ; 
as first, that the ship was certainly the same, and 
that some of the seamen among them knew her, and 
had been on board her ; and secondly, that when we 
had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they 
were coming down to examine us, we fought their 
boats and fled ; so that we made no doubt but they 
were fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were 
satisfied of the contrary ; and as I often said, 1 know 
not but I should have been apt to have taken those 
circumstances for evidence if the tables were turned, 
and my case was theirs, and have mode no scniple of 
cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or 
perhaps considering, what they might have to ofler 
in their defence. 

But let that be how it will, those were our appre- 
hensions ; and both my partner and I too scarce 
slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard- 
arms, that IS to say, gibbets ; of fighting, and being 
taken ; of killing, and being killed ; and one night I 
[a46j 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Tmu in Mich a fiiiy in my dream, fancying the Dutch- 
meii had bparded us, and I was knocliing one of their 
MMMen down, that I struck my double fist against 
the side of the cabin I la^ in with such a force as 
wounded my hand most gnevouslv, broke my knuck- 
les, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it not 
onljr waked me out of my sleep, but I was once 
afiaid I should have lost two of my Angers. 

Another apprehension I had was, of the cruel 
usa^ we might meet with from them if we fell into 
their hands; then the story of Amboyna came into 
ray head, and how the Duti'h might, perhaps, torture 
us, as th^ did our countrymen there ; and make 
some of the men, by extremity of torture, confess 
those crimes they never were guilty of, own them- 
selves, and all of us, to be pirates , and so they would 
put us to death, with a formal appearance of justice ; 
and that they might be temptra to do thus’ for the 
gain of our snip and cargo, \mich was worth four or. 
flve thousand pounds, put all together. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, 
night and day ; nor did we consider that the captains 
of ships have no authority to act thus ; and if we had 
Burrended prisoners to them, they could not answer 
the destroying us, or torturing "us, but would be 
accountable for it when they came into their own 
country. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction ; for 
if they will act thus with us, what advantage would 
it be to us that they would be called to an account 
for it ; or if we were first to be murdered, what satis- 
faction would it be to us to have them punished 
when they came home? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections 
I now had upon the past variety of my particular 
circumstances; how hard I thought it was that I, 
who had srant forty years in a life of continued diffl- 
oulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


or haven which all men drive at, viz., to have rest 
and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by 
my own unhappy choice , and that I, who'escaped so 
many dangers in my youth, should now come to be 
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for 
a crime I was not in the least inclined to, much less 
really guilty of ; and in a place and circumstance, 
where innocence was not like to be any prot^ion at 
all to me. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would 
come in ; and I would he considering that this seemed 
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence, 
and I ought to look upon it, and subiqit to it, as 
such ; that although I was innocent as to men, I was 
far from being innocent as to my Maker ; and I 
ought to look in and examine what other crimes in 
my life were more obvious to me, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a 
retribution ; and that I ought to submit to this, just 
as I would to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to 
have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural coinage would sometimes take 
its place, and then I would be talking myself up to 
vigorous resolutions, that I would not be taken to be 
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in 
cold blood , that it were much better to have fallen 
into the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters, 
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me when they 
had taken me, than by those who would perhaps glut 
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and bar- 
barities, that in the case of the savages I always 
resolved to die flghting to the last gasp ; and why 
should I not do so, seeing it was much more dreaxl- 
ful, to me at least, to think of falling into these men's 
hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by 
menP for the sava^, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was dead, and killed him first,

an we do 8 bullock ; but that these men had manjr 
art* be^rond the cruelty of death. Whenever these 
thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself in a 
kind of fever with the agitations of a supposed dght ; 
my blood would boil, and my eves sparkle, as if I 
was engaged: and I always resolved that I would 
take no quarter at their hands ; but even at last, if I 
could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, 
and all* that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

By how much the greater weight the anxieties 
and perplexities of these things weic to our thoughts 
while we were at sea, by so much the greater was our 
satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and my 

i iartner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy 
oad upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, 
and found that he was not able to stand long under 
it, but that the Portuguese pilot came and took it 
off his back, and the hill uusappcaicd, the m-ound 
before him showing all smooth and plain , and tiuly 
it was so ; we were all like men who had a load taken 
off their backs. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart that I was not able any longer to bear ; ana, 
as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in 
that ship. When we came on shore the old pilot, 
who was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a 
warehouse for our goods, which, by the way. was 
much the same. It was a little house, or hut, with 
a large house joining to it, all built with canes, and 
paliswoed round with large canes to keep out pil- 
fering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few 
in that country. However, the magistrates allowed 
us also a little guard, and we had a sentinel w’ith a 
kind of halberd, or half pike, who stood sentinel at 
our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice and 
a little piece of money, about the value of three- 
[ 248 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

pence, per day ; so that our goods were kept veiy 
safe. 

The fair or mart usually kept in this place had 
been over some time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two 
Japanners (I mean ships from Japan), with goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not gone 
aw^, having Japanese merchants on shore. 

rnie first thing our old Portuguese pilot dfd for us 
was to bring us acquainted with three missionary Rom- 
ish priests who were in the towm, and who had been 
there some time converting the people to Christian- 
ity ; but we thought they made out poor work of it, 
and made them but soriyr Christians when they had 
done. However, that was none of our bu.siness. 
One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called 
Father Simon. He was a jolly, well-conditioned 
man, very free in his coniersation, not seeming so 
serious and gi-ave as the other two did, one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese ; but 
Father Simon was courteous, easy m his manner, 
and very agreeable company ; the other two were 
more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied 
seriously to the work tliat came about, viz., to talk 
with, and insinuate themselves among, the inhab- 
itants wherever they had opportunity. We often ate 
and drank with those men ; and though I must con- 
fess the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to 
Chnstiaiiity is so far from the true conversion re- 
quired to bring heathen people to the faith of 
Christ, that it seems to amount to little more than 
letting them know the name of Christ, and say 
some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son in a 
tongue which they understand not, and to cross 
themselves and the like ; yet it must be confessed 
that these religious, whom we call missionaries, have 
a firm belief tliat these peonle shall be saved, and 



HOBINSON CRUSOE 


that they are the instruments of it; and on this 
account th^ undergo not only the fatigue of the 
voyage, and hazards of living in such places, but 
oftentimes death itself, with the most violent tor- 
tures, for the sake of this work ; and it would be a 
great want of charity in us, whatever opinion we 
have of the work itself, and the manner of their 
doing it, if we should not have a good opinion of 
their zeal, who undertook it with so many hazards, 
and who have no prospect of the least temporal 
advantage to themselves. 

But to return to iny story. This French priest. 
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of 
the chief of the mission to go up to Peking, the 
royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only 
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him 
from Macao to go along with him , and we scarce 
ever met together but he was inviting me to go that 
jouraey, telling me how he would show me all the 
glorious things of that mighty empire, and among 
the rest the greatest city in the world , a city, said 
he, that your London and our Parf», put together, 
cannot be equal to. Tins was the city of Peking, 
which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of 
people ; but as I looked on those things with differ- 
ent eyes from other men, so I .shall give my opinion 
of them in few words when I come in the course rf 
my travels to speak more particularly of them. 

But first 1 come to my friar or missionary. Dining 
with him one day, and being very ineiry together, 1 
showed some little inclination to go with him ; and 
he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many persuasions, to consent. “ Why, Father 
Simon," says my partner, “ why should you desire 
our company so much P You know we are heretics, 
and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company 
with any pleasure." — “Oh!" says he, “you may, 
[860] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


perhapa, be good Catholics in time; my business 
here 18 to convert heathens, and who knows but I 
may convert you too ? ” — “ Very well, fiatiiet," said 
I, “so you will picach to us all the way." — “I 
won't be troublesome to you," says he ; “ our religion 
does not divest us of good manners ; besides," says 
he, “ we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, 
compared to the place we are in ; and if you are 
Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may be all Chris- 
tians at last , at least," said he, “ we are all gentle- 
men, and we may converse so without being uneasy 
to one another." I liked that part of his mscourse 
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my 
pnest that I had left in the Brazils ; but this Father 
Simon did not come up to his character by a great 
deal ; for though Father Simon had no appearance 
of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not 
that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere 
affection to religion that my other good ecclesiastic 
had, of whom I nave said so much. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, 
nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had some- 
thing else before us at first ; for we had all this while 
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of ; and we 
began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we 
were now in a place of verj little business; and once 
]j|Was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam 
and the city of Nanking ; but Providence seemed 
now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to concern 
itself in our affair ; and I was encouraged from this 
very time to think I should, one way or other, get 
out of this tangled circumstance, and be brought 
home to my own country again, though I had not 
the least view of the manner; and when I began 
sometimes to think of it, could not imagine by what 
method it was to be done ; Providence, I say, began 
here to clear up our wire a little ; and the first tmng 
[ 261 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot 
bfoqght a Japan merchant to us, who liegan to in- 
t)uire what gt^s we had ; and, in the first place, he 
booglht all our opium, and gave us a very good price 
for it, paying us in gold by weight, sonic in small 
pieces of their own coin, and some in small wedges, 
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him fur our opium, it came into niy 
head that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the 
ship too ; and I ordei^ the interpreter to propose 
it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it when it 
was first proposed to him ; but in a few days aftei 
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for 
his inteipreter, and told me he had a proposal to 
make to me, and that was this ; he had bought a 
great quantity of goods of us when he had no 
thou^ts, or proposals made to him, of buying the 
ship, and that, tnereforc, he had not money enough 
to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the same men 
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the 
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence 
to the Philippine Islands with another loading, w hich 
he would pay the freight of before they went from 
Japan ; and that, at their return, he would buy the 
ship. I began to listen to his proposal , and so 
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I 
could not but begin to entertain a notion of goiqg 
myself with him, and to sail from the Philippine 
Islands awOT to the South Seas ; and accordingly I 
asked the Japan merchant if he' would nut hire us 
to the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there. 
He said no, he could not do that, for then he could 
not have the i-eturn of his cargo ; but he would dis- 
char« us in Japan, he said, at the ship's return. 
Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, 
and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than my- 
self, penuadra me fiom it, representing the dangers 
[2S8] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


as well of the seas as of the Japane8e« who ore a 
false, cruel, and treacherous people ; and then of the 
Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, 
and more treacherous than they. 

But to bring this lung turn of our affairs to a con- 
clusion. The nrst thing we had to do was to consult 
with the captain of the ship and with his men, and 
know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and while 
I was doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my 
nephew had left a ith me as my companion for my 
travels, came to me, and told me that he thought 
that voyage promised very fair, and that th€re was a 
great prospect of advantage, and he would be very 
glad it I undertook it ; but that if I would not, and 
would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or 
how I pleased to order him ; that if ever he came to 
England, and I was there, and alive, he would render 
me a faithful account of his success, and it should be 
as much mine as I pleased. 

I was really loath to part with him ; but consid- 
ering the prospect of advantage, which was really 
considerable, and that he was a young fellow as 
likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to 
let him go ; but first I told niin I would consult my 
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My 
partner and I discoursed about it, and my partner 
i|^ade a most generous offer. He told me, “You 
know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both re- 
solve not to go to sea in it again ; if your steward (so 
he called my man) will ventuie the voyage, I ’ll leave 
my sharo of the vessel to him, and let him make his 
brat of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and 
he meeta with success abroad, he shall account for 
one-half of the profits of the ship's freight to us, the 
other shall be his own.” 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my 
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no 
[ 268 ] 



BOBINSON CRUSOE 


Jam thin o^r him the same ; and all the ship's oom- 
pany being willing to go with him, we made over 
baJf the ship to him in property, and took a writing 
from him, obliging him to account for the other ; 
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant 
proved a veiy punctual honest man to him, protected 
him at Japan, and got him a licence to come on 
shore, which the Europeans in general have not 
lately obtained, paid him his freight very punctu- 
ally, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan 
and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who 
trafficking with the Spaniards brought back Euro- 
pean goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and 
other spices { and there he was not only paid his 
freight very well, and at a very good price, hut being 
not willing to sell the ship then, the merchant fur- 
nished him with goods on his own account ; that for 
some money and some spices of his own, which he 
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, to 
the Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. 
Here naving gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, 
he got his ship made a free ship ; and the governor 
of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, in Amenca, 
on the coast of Mexico ; and gave him a licence to 
land there, and travel to Mexico; and to pass in any 
Spanish ship to Europe, with all his men. 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and 
there he sold his ship; and having there also ob- 
tained allowance to travel by land to Porto fiello, 
he found means somehow or other to get to Jamaica 
with all his treasure, and about eight years after 
came to England exceeding lich, of the which I 
shall take notice in its place ; in the meantime, I re- 
turn to our particular affairs. 

Being now to pai't with the ship and ship's com- 
pany, it came betore us, of course, to consider what 
recompense we should give to the two men that they

gav«i us such timely notice of the design ag^nst us in 
the river of Cambodia. The titith was, thM: tbw 
had done us a considerable service, and deserved wul 
at our hands, though, by the way, they were a couple, 
of rogues too ; for as they believed the story of our 
lieing pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the ship, they came down to us not only to oetiay 
the design that was formed against us, but to go to 
sea with us as pirates ; and one of them confessed 
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going 
a-roguing brought him to do it. However, the ser- 
vice they did us was not the less ; and therefore, as 
I had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered 
the money to be paid to them which they said was 
due to them on board their respective ships ; that is 
to say, the Englishman nineteen months' pay, and to 
the Dutchman seven , and over and above that I 
gave them, each of them, a small sum of nionw in 
gold, and which content^ them very well, linen 
I made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gun- 
ner being now made second mate and pmaer; the 
Dutchman 1 made boatswain, so they were both 
very well pleased, and proved very serviceable, being 
both able seamen, and veiy stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China. If 1 thought 
myself banished and remote from my own country at 
Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for my 
money, what could I think of myself now, when I 
was gotten about a thousiuid leagues farther off from 
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pros- 
pect of return ? 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
months' time there was to be another fair at the 
place where we were, and then we mi^t be able to 
purchase all sorts of the manufiictures of the country, 
and withal might possibly find some Chinese Judm 
or vessels from Tonquin that would be to be sold, 
[S55] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


and would cany us and our goods whither we pleased. 
Tliis I liked very well, and resolved to wait ; heside^ 
as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if 
any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps 
we might have an opportunity to load our goods, 
and get passage to some other place in India nearer 
home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; 
but to divert ourselves we took two or three journeys 
into the country. First, we went ten days’ journey 
to see the city of Nanking, a city well worth seeing 
indeed ; they say it has a million of people in it, 
which, however, I do not believe. It is regularly 
built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one 
another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it 
great advantage. 

But when I come to compare the miserable people 
of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their man- 
ner of living, their government, their religion, their 
wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must con- 
fess I do not so much as think it is worth naming, 
or worth my while to write of, or any that sh^ 
come after me to read. 

It is ver^ observable that we wonder at the grand- 
eur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the gov- 
ernment, the manuUutures, tlic commerce, and the 
conduct of these people ; not that it is to be won- 
dered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded ; 
but because, h&ving first a true notion of the oarbar- 
ity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance 
that prevails there, we do not expect to find any 
such things so far off. 

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces 
and royal hidings of Europe? What is their 
trade to the univei-sal commerce of England, Hol- 
land, France, and Spain ? What are their cities to 
ours for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


furniture, And an infinite variety ? What are their 
ports, supplied with a few junlu and barks, to our 
naviration, our merchant fleets, our large and pow- 
erfuf navies P Our city of London has mcne trade 
than all their mighty empire. One English, or 
Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty mns would 
fight and destroy all the shipping of Chino. But 
the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power 
of their government, and strength of their armies, is 
surprising to us, because, as I nave said, considering 
them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better 
than savages, we did not expect such things among 
them ; and this, indeed, is the advantage with which 
all their greatness suid power is represented to us, 
otherwise it is in itself nothing at all. For as I 
have said of their ships, so may be said of their arm- 
ies and troops ; all the forces of their empire, though 
they were to bring two millions of men into the fimd 
together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the 
country, and starve themselves. If they were to be- 
siege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disci- 
plined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of 
French cavidry, would overthrow all the horse of 
China ; a million of their foot could not stand before 
one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not 
to be surrounded, though they were to be not one to 
twenty in number ; nay, I do not boast if I say that 
30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000 French 
horse, would &irly brat all the forces of China. 
And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of our 
engineers, in assaulting and defending towns ; there 's 
not a fortified town in China could hold out one 
month against the batterira and attacks of an Euro- 
pean army ; and at the same time, all the armies in 
China could never take such a town as Dunkirk, 
provided it was not starved ; no, not in ten yean' 
siege. They have firearms, 'tis true, but they are

awkwsud, dumsy, and uncertain in going off ; they 
hsr« powder, but it ia of no stren^h ; they have 
neither disciph'ne in the field, exercise to their arms, 
skill to attack, or temper to retreat ; and therefore 
I must confess it seemed strange to me when I came 
home and heard our people say such fine thinra of 
the power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of 
the Chinese, because I saw and knew that they were 
a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid 
slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to 
rule such a people ; and, in a word, for I am now 
launched quite beside my design, I say, in a word, 
were not its distance inconceivably great from Mus- 
covy, and was not the Muscovite einpii'e almost 
as rude, impotent, and ill-governcd a crowd of slaves 
as they, the Czar of Muscovy might, with much ease, 
drive them all out of their country, and conquer 
them in one campaign ; and had the Czar, who I 
since hear is a growing pnnee, and begins to appear 
formidable in the world, fallen this way instead of 
attacking the warlike Swedes, in which attempt none 
of the powers of Europe would have envied or inter- 
rupted him, he might, by this time, have been Em- 
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the King 
of bweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to 
six in number. 

As their strength and their grandeur, so their navi- 
gation, commerce, and husbandry is imperfect and 
impotent compared to the same things in Europe. 
Also in their knowledge, their learning, their skill in 
the sciences; they have globes and spheres, and a 
smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics ; but 
when you come to inquire into their knowledge, how 
sh<Ht-sighted are the wisest of their students ! They 
know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies ; 
and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the 
sun is ewpsea they think 't is a great dragon has

assaulted and run away with it, and they fall a-dat- 
terin^ with all the drums and kettles in the country 
to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a 
swarm of bees. 

As this is the only excursion of this kind which 
I have made in all the account I have given of my 
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of coun- 
tries and people; 'tis none of my business, or any 
part of my design, but giving an account of my own 
adventures, through a life of inimitable wanderings, 
and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few 
that come after me will have heard the like of. I 
shall, therefore, say very little of all the mighty 
places, desert countries, and numerous people I have 
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own 
story, and which ray concern among them will make 
necessary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in 
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty de- 
grees north of the line, for we were returned from 
Nanking. I had, inde^, a mind to see the city of 
Peking, which I had heard so much of, and Father 
Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length his 
time of going away being set, and the other mission- 
ary, who was to go with him, being arrived from 
Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either 
to go, or not to go ; so I referred him to my part- 
ner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length 
resolved it in the affirmative, and we prepared for 
our journey. 

We set out with very good advantage as to finding 
the way ; for we got leave to travel in the retinue of 
one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy, or princi- 
pal magistrate, in the province where th^ reside, 
and who take great state upon them, travelling with 
great attendance, and with great homage from the 
people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by , 
them, because all the countries they pass through 
[ 269 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


are obliged to furnish provisions for them, and all 
their attendance. That which I particularly ob- 
served as to our travelling with his baggage, was 
this,* that though we received sufficient provisions, 
both for ourselves and our horses, from the country, 
as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were oblige 
to pay for everything we had after the market-price 
of the country, and the mandarin's steward, or rom- 
missary of the provisions, collected it duly from us ; 
so that our travelling in the retinue of the man- 
darin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was 
not such a mighty favour in him, but was, indeed, a 
great advantage to him, consideiing there were above 
thirty other people travelled in the .same manner be- 
sides us, under the protection of his I'etinue, or, as 
we may call it, under his convo\ , this, I say, w-as a 
great advantage to him, for the country furnished 
all the provisions for nothing, and he took all our 
money for them. 

We were five and twenty days tiavelhng to 
Peking, through a country infinitely populous, but 
miserably cultivated; the hiisliandry, tlie economy, 
and the way of living miserable, though thev boa.st 
so much of the industry of the people , I say miser- 
able;, and so it is, if we, who undei-stand how to 
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our 
own ; but not so to these poor wretches, who know 
no other. The pride of these people is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, 
which adds to that which I call their misery ; and I 
must needs think the naked savages of America live 
much more happy, because, as they have nothing, so 
they desire nothing; whereas these are proud and 
insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and 
drudges ; their ostentation is inexpressible, and is 
.chiefly showed in their clothes and Duildings, and in 
keeping multitudes of servants or slaves ; and which 
[ 260 ] 



ROBINSOxV CRUSOE 


is to the last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all 
the world but themselves. 

I must confess I travelled more pleasantly after- 
wards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand 
Tartary than here ; and yet the roads here are 
well paved and well kept, and very convenient for 
travellers ; but nothing was more awkward to me than 
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people in 
the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignoranc'ej_for 
all their famed ingenuity is no more ; and my friend 
Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these 
occasions to see the beggarly pride of those people. 
For example, coming by the house of a country gentle- 
man, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues 
off of the city of Nanking, wc had, fii-st of all, the 
honour to ride with the master of the house about 
two miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Don 
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poierty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for 
a scaramouch or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, 
with all the tawdry and trapping of a fool’s coat, 
such as hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes 
almo.st on every side, it covered a taffeta \est, a.s 
gimsy as a butcher, and which testified that his 
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven. His 
horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, 
such as in England might sell for about thirty or 
forty shillings , and he had two slaves followed him 
on foot, to drive the poor creature along. He had 
a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as 
fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail ; 
and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve 
servants ; and we were told he was going from the 
city to his country scat, about half a league before 
us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a 
gentleman rode away before us, and we stopped at a 
village about an hour to refresh us. 

[ 261 ] 



AOBINSON CRUSOE 


When we came by the country seat of this great 
man, we saw him in a little place before his door, 
esting his repast. It was a hind of a garden, but 
he was easy to be seen ; and we were given to under- 
stand that the more we looked on him, the better 
he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, some- 
thing like the palmetto- tree, which effectually shaded 
him over the head, and on the south side; but 
under the tree also was placed a large umbrella, 
which made that part look well enough. He sat 
Iplling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, 
corpulent man, and his meat being brought him 
by two women slaves. He had two more, whose 
office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would ac- 
cept of their service in, viz., one fed the squire with 
a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, 
ana scraped off' what he let fall upon his worship's 
beard and taffeta vest , while the great fat brute 
thought it below him to employ his own hands in 
any of those familiar offices which kings and monarehs 
would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy 
fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pains men's pride 
puts them to, and how tioiiblesome a haughty 
temper, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of 
common-sense ; and leaving the poor wretch to please 
himself with our looking at him, as if we admired 
his pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned 
him, we pursued our journey; onlj Father Simon 
had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what 
dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his 
state ; which he said he had the honour to taste of, 
and which was, I think, a dose that an English 
hound would scarce have eaten if it had been offered 
him, viz., a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of 
garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, 
and another plant which they have there, something 
[86S] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

like our giujrer, but smelling like musk, and tasting 
like mustara. All this was put to^tiier, and a 
small lump or piece of lean mutton Imiled in it ; 
and this was his worship's repast, four or five ser- 
vants more attending at a distance. If he fed them 
meaner than he was fed himself, the spice excepted, 
they must fare very coai'sely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was respected like a king; surrounded alwavs with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a 
distance , but this I observed, that there was not a 
horse in his retinue but that our carriers' pack-horses 
in England seem to me to look much better ; but 
they were so covered with equipage, mantles, trap- 
pings, and such like trumpery, that you cannot see 
whether they are fat or lean , in a word, we could 
see scarce anything but their feet and their heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an. account of being 
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which 
made this journey the pleasanter to me ; nor had I 
anv ill accident attended me, only in the passing or 
fording a small nver my horse fell, and made me 
free of the country, as they call it , that is to say, 
threw me in. The place was not deep, but it wfettM 
me all over. I mention it, because it spoiled my 
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of 
several people and places which I had occasion to 
remember, and which, not taking due care of, the 
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be 
read, to my great loss as to the names of some places 
I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrivM at Peking. I had nobody 
^ith me but the youth, whom my nephew, the cap- 
tain, had given me to attend me as a servant, and 
who proved very trusty and diligent , and my part- 
t 26S] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was 
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being 
desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage, 
that is to say, bore his charges for his company, and 
to use him as an interpreter, for he undei stood the 
lan^age of the country, and spoke good French and 
a little English ; and, indeed, this old man was a 
most useful implement to iis everywhere; foi we had 
not been above a week at Peking, when he came 
laughing. “Ah, seignior Inglese,” says he, “I have 
something to tell you will make your heart glad.” — 
“ My heart glad,” savs 1, “ what can that be I 
doni; know anything in this couiitiy can either give 
me joy or grief, to any great degree.” — “ Yes, yes,” 
saici the md man in broken English, “make you 
glad, me sorrow ,” sorry, he would have said. This 
made me more inquisitive. “Whi,” said I, “will 
it make you sorry ? ” — “ Because,” said he, “ you 
have brought me here twenty-five days’ |ourney, and 
will leave me to go bavk alone; and which way shall 
I get to my port aft,cnvaid.s, without a ship, without 
a horse, without pecune so he called money , being 
his broken I.Mtin, of which he had abundance to 
make us meny with. 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of 
Muscovite and Polish merchants in tlie city, and 
they were preparing to set out on their journey, by 
land, to Muscovy within four or five weeks, aiid he 
was sure we would take the opportunity to go with 
them, and leave him behind to go back all alone. I 
confess I was surprised with his news. A secret joy 
spread itself over my whole soul, which I cannot 
desmbe, and never felt before or since ; and I had 
no power, for a good while, to speak a word to the 
old man ; but at last 1 turned to him. “ How do 
you know this? ” said I ; “are you sure it is true?" 
— “ Yes,” says he, “ I met thi.s morning in the street 
r264] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one 

J rou call a Grecian, \iho is among them; he came 
ast from Astrakhan, and was designing to go to 
Tunquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered 
his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan 
to Moscow, and so down then verVolga to Astrakhan." 
— “ Well, seignior,” s^s I, “ do not be uneasy about 
being left to go hack alone. If this be a method for 
my return to England, it shall be your fault if you 
go back to Macao at all." We then went to con- 
sulting together what W'as to be done, and I asked 
my paitner whnt he thought of the pilot’s news, and 
whether it would suit with his affairs. He told me 
he would do just as I would ; for he had settled all 
his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in 
such good hands, that as wc hnd made a good voy- 
age heie, if he could vest it in China silks, wi-ougnt 
and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, 
he would be content to go to England, and then 
make his voyage back to ]^ngal by the Company’s 
ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our 
Portugal pilot would go with us we would bear his 
charges to Moscow, or to England if he pleased; 
nor, indeed, weio we to be esteemed over-geiieious 
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther ; for the service he had done us was really 
worth all that, and more , for he hod not only been 
a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker 
for us on shoie, and his procuring for us the Japan 
merchant was some luiiidi^ of pounds in ourpcxiket. 
So we consulted together about it ; and being willing 
to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him jus- 
tice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, 
for be was a most necessary man on all occasions, we 
agreed to give him a quantity of coined ^old, which, 
as I compute it, came to about .£176 sterling between 
[ 266 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


ua, and to bear all his charges, both for himself and 
horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him 
to let him know what we had resolved. I told him 
he had complained of our being to let him go back 
alone, and 1 was now to tell him we were resolved he 
should not go back at all ; that as we had resolved 
to go to Europe with the caravan, we lesolved also 
he should go with us, and that we called him to know 
his mind. He shook his head, and said it was a long 
journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, 
or to subsist himself when he came there. We told 
him we believed it was so, and therefore we had 
resolved to do something for him that should let 
him see how sensible we were of the service he had 


done us, and also how agreeable he was to us ; and 
then 1 told him what we had resolved to give him 
here, which he might lay out as we would do our 
own ; and that as for his charges, if he would go 
with us, we would set him safe ashore, life and 
casualties excepted, either in Muscovy or England, 
which he would, at our own chai’ge, except only the 
carriage of his goods. 

He received the proposal like a man transported, 
and told us he would go with us over the whole 
world; and so, in short, we all prepared oui'selves 
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it 
was with the other merchants; they had many 
things to do, and instead of being ready in five 
weeks, it was four months and some odd days before 
all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when 
we set out from Peking. My partner and the old 

□ t had gone express back to the port where we 
drst put in, to dispose of some goods which we 
had left there ; and I, with a Chinese merchant, 
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanking, and 
[* 6 ^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


who came to Pekine on his own affairs, went to 
Nanking, where I nought ninety pieces of fine 
damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other 
very fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed with 
gold, and had all these brought to Peking against 
my partner's return. Besides this, we bought a 
very large quantity of raw silk, and some other 
goods ; our cargo amounting, in these goods only, 
to about three thousand five hundred pounds ster- 
ling, which, together with tea, and some fine calicoes, 
and three camels' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded 
in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those we 
rode upon ; which, with two or three spare horses, 
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in 
short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hundred 
horse, and upwards of a hundred and twenty men, 
very well armed, and provided for all events ; for, as 
the eastern caravans are subjected to be attacked 
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but they 
are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor 
so barbarous when they prevail. 

The company consists of pecmie of several nations, 
such as Muscovites chiefly; lor there were above 
sixty of them who were merchants or inhabitants 
of Momxjw, though of them some were Livonians; 
and to our particular satisfaction, five of them were 
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experi- 
ence in business, and men of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen- 
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the passen- 
gers, except the servants, to a great council, as they 
call^ it. At this great council every one deposited 
a cei-tain quantity of money to a common stock fiw 
the necessary expense of^i^ing forage on the wayt 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satis- 
fying the guides, getting horses, and the like. And 
here they constituted the journey, as they call it, 
via., they named captains and officers, to draw us all 
up, and give the command in case of an attack, and 
gave every one their turn of command ; nor was 
tins forming us into order, any more than what we 
found neemul upon the way, as shall be observed 
in its place. 

The road all on this side of the country is very 
populous, and is full of potters and earth makers ; 
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for 
the China ware; and as I was coming along, our 
Portugal pilot, who had always something or other 
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and 
told roe he would show me the greatest rarity in all 
the countiy ; and that I should have this to say of 
China, after all the ill-humoured things I had said 
of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be 
sfeen in all the world beside. I was very importu- 
nate to know what it was. At last he told me it 
was a gentleman's house, built all with China ware. 
“Well,” says I, “are not the materials of their 
building the product of their own country ; and so 
is all China ware, is it not ” — “ No, no," says he, 
“ I mean it is an house all made of China ware, such 
as you call it in England ; or, as it is called m our 
country, porcelain.” — “ Well,” says I, “ such a 
thing may be ; how big is it ? can we carry it in 
a box upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it.” — 
“ Upon a camel ! ” says the old pilot, holding up 
both his hands ; “ why, there is a family of thirty 
people in it.” 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it , and when I 
came to it, it was nothing but this : it was a timber 
house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with 
lath and plaster, but all the plastering was really 
[268 J 



BOBINSON CRUSOE 


China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the 
earth that makes China ware. 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfect white, and 

g linted with blue ligures, as the large China ware in 
ngland is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. 
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, 
were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like 
the little smiare tiles we calls galley tiles in England, 
all made or the finest china, and the figures exceed- 
ing fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, 
mixed with gold, many tiles making but one hgure, 
but joined so aiiificaliy, the mortar being m^e of 
the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the 
tiles met. The doors of the rooms were of the same 
composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we 
have in use in several parts of England, especially 
Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c., 
as hard as a stone, and smooth, but not burnt and 
painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, 
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile ; 
the ceiling and, in a word, all the plastering work in 
the whole house were of the same earth ; and, after 
all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but 
of a deep shining black. 

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and 
literally to lie called so; and had I not been upon 
the journey, I could have stayed some days to see 
and examine the particulars of it. They told me 
there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, 
all paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and 
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely 
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so 
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very 
sure they excel in their accounts of it, for they told 
me such incredible things of their performance in 

[ 269 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


«i!k)ckety-ware, for such it is, that I care not to rdat^ 
as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in 
patticalar, of one workman that made a ship, with 
all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in eaiihenware, 
enough to cany fifty men. If he had told me 
he Uuinched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, 
I might have said something to it indeed ; but as it 
was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in 
short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow 
lied; so I bmiled, and said nothing to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the 
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three shillings , and told me, 
if it had been three days' journey without the wall, 
as it was three days within, he must have fined me 
four times as inucli, and made me ask pai-don the 
next council-day ; so I promised to lie more orderly ; 
for, indeed, I found afterward the oidei's made for 
keeping all together were absolutely neccssaiy fur our 
cointnon safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification against the Tartars , and a 
very great work it is, going over hills and mountains 
in a iieedlevs traik, where the rocks are impassable, 
and the precipices such as no enemy lould possibly 
enter, or iiidera climb up, or where, if they did, no 
wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is 
near a thousand English miles, but that the country 
is five huiidreii in a straight measuied line, which the 
wall hounds, without measuring the windings and 
turnings it takes ; 'tis about four fathoms high, and 
as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without tres- 
passing our orders, for so long the caravan was in 
passing the gate , I say, I stood still an hour to look 
at it on every side, near, and far off ; I mean, that 
was within my view ; and the guide of our caravan,

who had been extolling it for the wonder of the 
world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. 
I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep off 
the Tartars, which he happened not to understand 
as I meant it, and so took it for a compliment ; but 
the old pilot laughed. “O seignior Inglese," says 
he, “you speak in colours." “ In colours ! " said I ; 
“ what do you mean by that ? ” “ Why, you speak 
what looks white this way, and black that way — 
gay one way, and dull another w'ay. You tell nim 
it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me, by 
that, it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, 
or it will keep out none but Tartars. I understand 
you, seignior Inglese, I understand you," says he, 
“ but seignior Chinese understood you his own 
way." 

“ Well," says I, “ seignior, do you think it would 
stand out an army of our country-people, with a good 
train of artillery, or our engineers, wito two com- 
panies of niiners ? Would not they batter it down 
in ten days, that an array might enter in battalia, or 
blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there 
should be no sign of it left " — “ Ah, ah ' ” says he, 
“ I know that.” The Chinese wanted mightily to 
know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him 
a few days after, for he was then almost out of their 
country, and he was to leave us in a little time after- 
ward ; but when he knew what I had said, he was 
dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more 
of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness 
while he stayed. 

After we had passed this mighto nothing, called a 
wall, something like the Piets' wall, and so &mous in 
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we be- 
gan to find the country thinly inhabited, and the 
people rather confined to live in fortified towns and 
cities, as being subject to the inroads smd depreda-

tioDf of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and 
therrfore are not to resisted by the naked inhabi- 
tants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping 
together in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw 
several troops of Tartars roving about , but when I 
came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that 
the Chinese Empire could be conquered by such con- 
temptible fellows ; for they are a iiici'e horde or 
crowd of wild fellows, keeping no order, and under- 
standing no discipline, or manner of fight 

Their horses are pool, lean, starved creatures, 
taught nothing, and fit for nothing; and this we said 
the fimt day we saw them, which was after we entered 
the wider part of the country. Our leader for the day 
gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, 
as they call it, and what was this but hunting of 
sheep ? However, it may be called hunting too , 
for the creatures arc the wildest and swiftest of foot 
that ever I saw of their kind, onl) they will not run 
a grcat way, and you are sure of sport when you be- 
gin the chase, for they appemr generally thirty or 
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep to- 
gether when they fl). 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it w as our hap 
to meet with about forty Tartars. Whether they were 
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another kind of prey, I know not ; but as scxni 
as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very 
loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never 
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear 

r in. We all supposed this was to call their fhends 
ut them; anci so it was fur hi less than half a 
quarter of an hour a trcx>p of forty or fifty more 
appeared at about a mile distanee ; but our work 
was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscxiw happened 

[ 272 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


to be amon^ us ; and as soon as he heard the hom 
he told US, in short, that we had nothing to do but 
to charge them immediateiv, without loss of time; 
and drawing u^ up in a line, he asked if we were 
resolved? We told him we were ready to follow 
him ; so he rode directly up to them. They stood 
gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no 
order, nor showing the face of any order at all ; but 
as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their 
aiTOws, which, however, missed us very happily. It 
seems they mistook not their aim, but their dis- 
tance , fur their arrows all fell a little short of us, 
but with so true an aim, that had we been about 
twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men 
wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great distance, we dred, and sent them leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, to 
fall in among them sword in hand, for so our bold 
Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a 
merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and 
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool 
courage too, that I never saw any man in action 
fitter for command. As soon as we came up to them 
we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew, but 
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. The 
only stand any of them made was on our right, where 
three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to 
come back to them, having a kind of sc-ymitar in 
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. 
Our brave commander, without a.sking anybody to 
follow him, gallops up close to them, and with his 
fusee knocks one of them off his horse, killed the 
second with his pistol, and the third ran away, and 
thus ended our fight. But we had this misfortune 
attending it, viz., that all our mutton that we had 
in chase got away. We had not a man killed or 
voi. n. — 19 [ 27S ]

hart; bat as for the Tartars there was about five 
uf iSi^em killed. Who were wounded, we knew not ; 
ImR this we knew, that the other party was so 
iHjg^ted with the noise .of our ^ns, ^at they 
made oiT, and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominion, 
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after- 
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast 
great wild desert, which held us three days' and 
nights' march; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leather bottles, and to en- 
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in the 
desert of Arabia. 

I asked whose dominion this was in, and they told 
me this was a kind of bonier, that might he called 
No Man's Land; being a part of the Great Kara- 
kathie, or Grand Taitary, but that, however, it was 
all reckoned to China , but that there was no care 
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, 
and therefore it was reckoned the woist desert in the 
whole world, though we were to go over some much 
laimr. 

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was 
at the first very frightful to me, we saw two or thiee 
times little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed 
to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design 
upon us ; and so, like tlie man who met the devil, if 
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to 
say to them ; we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to 
stand and gaze at us ; whether it was to consider 
what they should do, whether attack us or not attack 
us, that we knew not ; but when we w-ere passed at 
some distance by them, we made a reaiguard of forty 
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan 
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us ; but after 
a while they marched off, only we found they saluted

ns with five arrows at their partine, one of which 
wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and we left 
him the next day, poor creature, in great need of a 
good farrier. We suppose they mi^t shodt more 
arrows, which might short of us ; but we saw no 
more arrows, or Tartars, that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not so bad as at first, though still in the domin- 
ions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the most 
part, in villages, some of which were fortified because 
of the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to 
one of these towns (it was about two days and a half 
journey before we were to come to the city Naum), 
I wanted to buy a camel, of which theie are plenty 
to be sold all the way upon that I'oad, and of horses 
also, such as they aie, because so many caravans 
coming that way they are often wanted. The person 
that I spoke to to get me a camel would have gone 
and fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must be 
officious, and go myself along with him. The place 
was about two miles out of the village, where, it 
seems, they kept the camels and horses feeding under 
a guard. 

I walked it on foot with my old pilot, being 
very desirous, forsooth, of a little variety. When 
we came to the place it was a low marshy ground, 
walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, with- 
out mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a 
little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having 
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came 
away ; and the Chinese man, that went with me, led 
the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars 
on horseback. Two of them seized the fellow, and 
took the camel from him, while the other three 
stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it 
were, unarmed ; for I had no weapon about me but 
my sword, which could but ill defend me against 
[ 276 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


three horsemen. The first that came up stopped 
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are 
arranl^ cowards), but a second coming up on my left 
gave me a blow on the head, whith I never felt till 
afterward, and wondered, when I came to myself, 
what was the matter with me, and where I was, for 
he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never-failing 
old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked 
for, directs deliverances from dangers which to us 
are unforeseen), had a pistol in his jiocket, which I 
knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither ; if they 
had, I suppose they would not have attacked us , 
but cowards are always boldest when there is no 
danger. 

The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart 
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laid 
hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down 
by main force a little towards him with the othei, 
shot him into the hetul, and laid linn dead upon the 
spot. He then iimnediately stepped up to him who 
had stop]ied us, as I said, and before be could come 
forward again, for it was all done as it were in a 
moment, made a blow at him with a scymitar, which 
he always wore, but missing the man, cut his horse 
into the side of his head, cut one of his ears off by 
the root, and a great slice down the .side of his face. 
The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no 
more to lie governed by his rider, though the fellow 
sat well enough too ; but away lie flew, and carried 
him quite out of the pilot’s reach, and at some dis- 
tance, rising up upon his hind-legs, threw down the 
Tartar, and fell upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had 
lost the camel, but he had no weapon. However 
seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fellen upon 
him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly 
ill-favoui^ weapon he had by his side, somethms 
[ 276 ] ^ 



ROBINSON CHUSOE 


like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neitlier, he 
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock 
his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man 
had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing 
he did not fly as he expected, nor come on to fight 
him as he apprehended, but stand stock still, the 
old man stood still too, and falls to work with his 
tackle to charge his pistol again. But as soon as the 
Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to be 
the same or another, I know not; but away he 
scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called 
him afterward, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when first I began to wake, that I had been in a 
sweet sleep , but as I said above, I wondered where I 
was, how 1 came upon the giound, and what was the 
matter; in a word, a few moments after, as sense 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where. 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody , then I felt my head ache, and then, in 
another moment, memory returned, and everything 
was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold 
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a 
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly 
by him ; and looking farther, I saw my champion 
and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese 
had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand 
The old man seeing me on iny feet came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and seeing me 
bloody, would see how I was hurt ; but it was not 
much, only what we call a broken head ; neither did 
I afterwaras And any great inconvenience flora the 
blow other than the pume which was hurt, and was 
•well again in two or tnree days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory,

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


fd* we lost a camel, and gained a horse , but that 
whidi was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village the man demanded to l)e paid for the camel. 

1 dispated it, and it was brought to a hearing before 
the Chinese judge of the place ; that is to say, in 
English, we went before a justice of the peace. Give 
him his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence 
and impartiality , and having heard both sides, he 
gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me to 
Buy the camel whose servant he was ? “ I am no 
servant,” says he, “ but went with the stranger.” — 
“ At whose request ? " says the justice. — “ At the 
stranger's request,” says ha — “ Why then,” says the 
justice, “ you were the stranger’s servant for the time, 
and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was 
delivered to him, and he must pay for it.” 

I confess the thing was clear, that I had not a word 
to say ; but admiring to see such just reasoning upon 
the consequence, and so accurate stating the case, I 

E aid willingly for the camel, and sent lor another ; 

ut you may observe, I sent for it ; I did not go and 
fetch it myself any more ; I had enough of that. 

The city of Naun is a frontier of the Chinese Em- 
pire. They call it foi'tified, and so it is, as fortifica- 
tions go there ; for this I will venture to affirm, that 
all the Tartars in Karakathie, which, I believe, are 
soiqe millions, could not batter down the walls with 
their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, if it 
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those 
who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' jour- 
ney of this city when messengers were sent express to 
every part of the road to tell all travellers and cara- 
vans to halt till they had a guard sent for them, for 
toat an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thou- 
sand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty ‘ 
miles beyond the city. 

[* 78 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


This was very bad news to traveUers. However, 
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were 
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord- 
ingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, 
and three hundred more from the city of Naun, and 
with those we advanced boldly ; the three hundred 
soldiers from Naun marched in our front, the two 
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side or 
our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan 
in the centre. In this order, and well prepared for 
battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole 
ten thousand Mongol Tartars if thejf had appeared ; 
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite 
another thing. 

It was early in the morning when, marching from 
a little well-situated town called Changu, we had a 
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry ; and had 
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the 
time to have attackra us, when, the caravan being over, 
the rearguard was behind ; but they did not appear. 

About three hours after, when we were entered 
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 
enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand indeed, 
for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had 
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and 
the soldiers frequently lookecl behind them, which is 
a certain sign in a soldier that he is ^ust ready to 
run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and be- 
ing near me, he called out, “ Seignior Inglese," says 
he, “ those fellows must be encouraged, or they will 
min us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they^ will 
never stand it.” — “I am of your mind,” said I, 
“ but what course must be done ? ” — “ Done ! ” says 
he, “ let fifty of our men advance and flank them on 

[ 879 ] 



ROBJNSON CRUSOE 


eadi wing, and encourage them, and they will fight 
like brave fellows in brave company ; but without, 
th^ will every man turn his baA.” Immediately I 
roM up to our leader and told him, who was exaitly 
of our mind ; and accordingly fift\ of us marched to 
the right wing, and fifty to ihe left, and the rest 
made a line of reserve, and so we marched, leading 
the last two hundred men to make another be dy by 
themselves, and to guard the camels , only that, if 
need were, they should send a bundled men to assist 
the last fifty. 

In a word, t^e Tartars came on, and an inminiei- 
able company they were; how many, we could not 
tell, but ten thousand we thought was ihe least. A 
party of them came on first and viewed our postuie, 
traversing the giound in the fiont of our line; and 
ns we found them within gunshot, our leader oidercd 
the two wings to advance swittlj, and give them a 
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done, 
hut they went off, and I suppose back to give an 
account of the reception thev were like to meet 
with; and indeed that salute i legged their stomach, 
for they immediately halted, stood a while to con- 
sider of it, and wheeling off to the left they gave 
over the design, and said no more to us for that 
time; which was very agreeahle to our circum- 
stances, which were hut very indifl'eient fora battle 
with such a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naun, 
or Naum. We thanked the governor for his care 
for us, and collected to the value of a bundled 
crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiei-s 
sent to guard us, and here we rested one day. This 
is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine bundled 
soldiers kept here , hut the reason of it was, fhat 
formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them 
than they do now, the Muscovites having abandoned 
[ 280 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


that part of the country (which lies from this city 
west for about two hundred miles) as desolate and 
unfit for use ; and more especially, being so very re- 
mote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its 
defence ; for we had yet above two thousand mil^ 
to Muscovy, propeidy so called. 

After this we pa.ssed several great riveis, and two 
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days 
passing over, and which, a.s I said, was to be called 
No Man’s Land , and on the 13th of April we came 
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I 
think the first city, or town, or foi tress, whatever it 
might be called, that belonged to the Czar 6f Mus- 
covy, was called Argunsk, being on the west side of 
the river Argun. 

I could nut but discover an infinite sati.sfaction 
that I was soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian 
country, or at least in a country governerl by Chris- 
tians , for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, 
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such 
they pretend to be, and are very devout in their 
way. It would certainly occur to any man who trav- 
els in the woild as I have done, and who had any 
power of reflection, I say, it would occur to him to 
reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the 
world where the name of God and of a Redeemer is 
known, worshipped, and adoied , and not where the 
people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions, 
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks 
and stones, worship monsters, elements, horrible 
shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters. 
Not a town or city we paased through but had their 
pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant 
people worshipping even the works of their own 
hands. 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the Chris- 
tian H’orship appeared, where the knee was bowed to 
[ 281] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Jesus ; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the 
Christ^ religion was owned, and the name of the 
true God was called upon and adored, and it njade 
the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. I sa- 
luted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above 
with my first acknowledgment of this ; and taking 
him by the hand, I said to him, “ Blessed be Go^ 
we are once again come among Christians ! " He 
smiled, and answered, “Do not rejoice too soon, 
countryman ; these Muscovites are but an odd sort 
of Ch^ians ; and but for the name of it, you may 
see veiy little of the substance for some months far- 
ther of our journey." 

“ Well," says I, “ but still ’t is better than pagan- 
ism, and worshipping of devils." — “Why, I ’ll tell 
you," says he, “ except the Russian soldiers in garri- 
sons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon 
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a 
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst 
and most ignorant of pagans." And so indeed we 
found it 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of 
solid earth, if I understand anything of the surface 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
earth. We had at least twelve hundrra miles to 
the sea, eastward ; we had at least two thousand to 
the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward ; and above 
three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went 
on west to the British and French channels ; we had 
full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea, 
south ; and about eight hundred miles to the Frozen 
sea, north; nay, if some people may be believed, 
there might be no sea north-east till we came round 
the pole, and consequently into the north-west, and 
so had a continent of land into Ameiica, the Lord 
knows where; though I could give some reasons 
why I bdieve that to be a mistake. 

[as*] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


As we entered into tbe Muscovite domioions a ' 
good while before «e came to any considerablfi towns, 
we had nothing to observe there but tiiis ; first, that 
all the rivers t^t run to the east -r* as I understood 
by the charts, which some in our caravan had with 
them — it was plain all those rivers ran into the 
great river Amour, or Gammour. This river, by 
the natural course of it, must run into the east sea, 
or Chinese ocean. I'he story they tell us, that the 
mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes of 
a monstrous growth, viz., three feet about, and twenty 
or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say I believe 
nothing of ; but as its navigation is of no use, because 
there is no trade that way, the Taiiars, to whom 
alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so 
nobody that ever I heard of has been curious enough 
either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or 
come up from the mouth of it in ships ; but this is 
certain, that this river running due east, in the lati- 
tude of [fifty degrees], carries a vast concourse of 
rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty 
itself in that latitude ; so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due 
north as the Amour runs east; and these are all 
found to join their waters with the great river Tar- 
tarus, named so from the northernmost nations of 
the Mongol Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the 
first Tartars in the world ; and who, as our geogra- 
phers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in 
sacred story. 

These rivers running all northward, as well as ail 
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that 
side, so that it does not seem rational in the least to 
think that the land can extend itself to join with 
America on that side, or that there is not a oom-

nninication between the northern and the eaetem 
/bcetM , bt^ of this I shall say no more ; it was my 
ob^iervidinn at that time, and therefoie I take notice 
of it in this We now advanced from the river 

Ai^un by eojK and inodemte journe}s, and were very 
visibly oblji^ to the care the Cssar of Muscovy has 
taken to have cities and towns built m as many places 
as are jsossible to place them, where his soldiers keep 
garrisbn something like the stationary soldiers placed 
by tlie Romans in the remotest countries of their 
empire, some of which I had read particularly were 
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and 
for the lodging 'travellers. And thus it was here; 
for wherever we came, though at these towns and 
stations the garrisons and governor were Russians 
and professed Christians, yet the inViabitants of the 
country were mere {lagans, sacriHcing to idols, and 
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or ^all the 
host of heaven , and not only so, but were, of all 
the heathens and pagans that ever 1 met with, the 
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man's flesh, as our savages of America did. 

tiome instances of this we met with in the country 
between Argunsk, where we entei the Muscovite 
dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians to- 
gether, called Nertcliinsk, in which is a continued' 
desert or forest, which cost us twenty days tn travel 
over it. In a village near the last of those places, I 
had the ciniosity to go and see their way of living, 
which IS most brutish and unsufierable. Tiiey had, 
I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood 
out U{)on an old stump of a tree an idol made of 
wood, fi*iehtful as the devil, at least as anything we 
can think of to represent the devil can be made. 
It had a head certainly not so much as resembling 
any creature that the world ever saw ; ears as big as 
goat’s horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown-

piece; a nose like a crooked ram's bom; and a 
mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion, 
with horrible teeth, hooked like a paiTot's under- 
bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that 
you could suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep- 
skins, with the w(x>l outward ; a great Tartar bonnet 
on the head, with two horns growing through it : it 
was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, 
or an^' other proportion of parts. 

This scarcecrow was set up at the outer side of 
the village; and when I came near to it there was 
sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women 
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by 
their habits, either of body or head ; these lay aU 
flat on the ground, lound this formidable block of 
shapeless wood. I saw no motion among them any 
more than if they had been all logs of wood, like 
their idol; and at firat really thought they had been 
so ; but when I came a little nearer, they started up 
upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it 
had been so many deepmouthed hounds, and walked 
away as if they were displeased at our disturbing 
them. A little way off' from the idol, and at the 
door of that tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins 
and cow-skins, dried, stood thi'ee butchers ; 1 thought 
they were such; when I came nearer to them I 
found they had long knives in their hands, and in 
the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, 
and one young bullock, or steer. These, it seems, 
were sacriflees to that senseless log of an idol, and 
these three men priests belonging to it; and the 
seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who 
brought the offering, and were making their prayers 
to that stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and 
brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever 1 was at 
anything in niy life ; to see God's most glorious and

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


bnl creature, to whom He had granted so many 
adcttitages, eveti by creation, above the rest of the 
works of His hands, vested with a reasonable sc>ul, 
and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities 
adapted both to honour his Maker and be honoured 
by Him, sunk and degenerated .to a degree so more 
than stupid as to prostrate itself to a inghtful 
nothing, a mere imaginan object dressed up b^ 
themsmves, and made terriine to themselves by their 
own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; 
and that this ^ould be the effect of mere ignorance, 
wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil him- 
self, who, envying (to his Maker) the homage and 
adoration of His creatures, had deluded them into 
such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things as 
one would think should shock Nature itself. 

But what signiffed all the astonishment and re- 
flection of thoughts Thus it was, .and I saw it 
before my eyes ; and there was no room to wonder 
at it, or think it impossible. All my admiration 
turn^ to rage; and I rode up to the image, or 
monster, call it what you will, and with my sword 
cut the bonnet that was on its bead in two in the 
middle, so that it hung down by one of the horns ; 
and one of our men that was with me took hold of 
the sheep-skill that covered it, and pulled at it, 
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling 
ran through the village, and two or three hundred 
people came about my ears, so that 1 was glad to 
scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; 
but I resolved from that moment to visit them 
again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, 
which was about four miles off, in order to provide 
some horses which they wanted, several of the horees 
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the 
way long march over the last desert ; so we had 
[* 86 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


some leisure here to put my design in execution. 1 
communicated my project to the Scots merchant ot 
Moscow, of whose courage I had had sufficient testi* 
mony, as above. I told him what I had seen, and 
with what indignation I had since thought that 
human nature could be so degenerate. I told him I 
was resolved, if I could but get four or five men well 
armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and de> 
stray that vile, abominable idol, and let them see 
that it had no power to help itself, and consequently 
could not be an object of worship, or to be prated 
to, much less help them that offei^ sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me. Sa^ns he, “ Your zeal ma^ be 
good, but what do you propose to yourself by it ? ” 
— “ Propose ! ” said I ; “to vindicate the honour of 
Grod, which is insulted by this devil worship.” — 
“ But how will it vindicate the honour of God,” 
said he, “ while the people will not be able to know 
what you mean by it, unless you could speak to 
them, and tell them so ? and then they will fight you, 
and beat you too, I 'll assure you, for they are des- 
perate fellows, and that especially in defence of their 
idolatry.” — “Can we not,” said I, “do it in the 
night, and then leave them the reasons and causes in 
wilting, in their own language?” — “Writing!” 
said he ; “ why, there is not a man in five nations 
of them that know anything of a letter, or how to 
read a word in any language, or in their own.” — 
“ Wretched ignorance ! ” said I to him ; “ however, 

I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps Nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how 
brutish they are to worship such horrid things.” — 
“ Look you, sir,” said he, “if your zeal prompts you 
to it so warmly, you must do it ; but in the next 
place I would have you consider these wild nations 
of people are subjects W force to the Czar of Mus* 
covy'a dominions ; and if you do this 'tis ten to one

bat tb^ will come by tbousaiidii to the governor of 
Nertdunek, and complain, and demand satisfaction ; 
and if he cannot ffve them satisfaction, 't is ten to 
one but they revolt, and will occasion a new nar with 
all the Tartars in the country.” 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for 
a while ; but I harped upon the same string still, and 
all that day I was uneasy to put my project in 
execution. Towards the evening the Scots merchant 
met me by accident in our wuk about the town, 
and desired to speak with me. “I believe,” said 
he, “ I have put jou off of your good dchign ; I have 
been a little concerned about it since, for I abhor 
the idol and idolatry as much as you can do.” — 
“ Truly,” says I, “ you have put it off a little as to 
the execution of it, but you have not put it all out 
of my thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still be- 
fore I q^uit this place, though I were to be delivered 
up to them for satisfaction.” — “ No, no,” says he ; 
“ God forbid they should deliver you up to such a 
crew of monsters 1 they shall not do that neither ; 
that would be murdering you indeed.” — “Why,” 
says I, “ how would they use me ? ” — “ Use you ' ” 
says he ; “ I ’ll tell you how they served a poor Rus- 
sian who affronted them in their worship just as you 
did, and who they took prisoner after they had 
lamed him with an arrow, that he could not run 
away. They took him and stripped him stark naked, 
and set him up on the top of the idol monster, and 
stood all round him, and shot as many arrows into 
him as mould stick over his whole body; and then they 
burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as a 
sacrifice to the idol." — “ And was this the same 
idol Yes,” says he, “the very same.” — 
“ Well,” says I, “ I ’ll tell you a story.” So I related 
the stoty of our men at Madimascar, and how they 
burnt and sacked the village there, and killed man,

woman, and child for their murdering one of our 
men, just as it is related before ; and when 1 had 
done, I added that I thought we ought to do so to 
this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but 
when I talked of doing so to that village, says he, 
“You mistake very much; it was not this village, 
it was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but 
it was the same idol, for they carry him about in 
procession all over the countrv.” — “ Well then,” 
says I, “ then that idol ought to be punished for it ; 
and it shall,” says I, “if 1 live this night out.” 

In a word, finding me lesolute, he liked the design, 
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go 
with me, and bring a stout fellow, one of his country- 
men, to go also with us; “and one,” says he, “as 
famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be 
against such devilish things as these.” In a won!, 
he brought me bis comrade, a Scotsman, whom he 
called Captain Richardson; and I gave him a full 
account of what I had seen, and, in a word, of what 
I intended ; and he told me readily he would go 
with me if it co.st him his life , so we agreed to go, 
only us three. I had, indeed, proposM it to my 
partner, but he declined it He said he wtu ready 
to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, 
for my defence ; but that this was an adventure quite 
out of his way ; so, I say, we resolved upon our work, 
only us three, and my man-servant, and to put it in 
execution that night about midnight, with all the 
secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts we were willing to 
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being 
to set forward in the morning, we supposed the gov- 
ernor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction 
upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots

priae as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's 
^Tobfr gown of the sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a 
bow ana arrows, and had provided the same for him- 
self and his counjx}’man, the people, if they saw 
us, should not be able to determine who we were. 

AD the first night we spent in mixing up some 
combustible matter with aqua-vitse, gunpowder, and 
such other materials as we could get ; and having a 
good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour 
after night we set out upon our exp^ition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people had not the least 
jealousy of danger attending their idol ; the night 
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough to 
see that tne idol stood just in the same posture and 
place that it did before. The people seemed to be 
all at their rest ; only, that in tne great hut, or tent, 
as we called it, where we saw the three prieste, whom 
we mistook for butchers, we saw a light, and going 
up close to the door we heard people talking, as if 
there were five or six of them. We concluded, 
therefore, that if we set idle wild-fire to the idol, 
these men would come out immediately and run up 
to the place to rescue it from the destruction that 
we intended for it ; and what to do with them we 
knew not Once we thought of carrying it away, 
and setting fire to it at a distance; but when we 
came to hmdle it, we found it too hu^ for our 
carriage, so we were at a loss again. The second 
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and 
knocking the creatures that were there on the head 
when they came out ; but I conld not join with that. 
I was against killing them, if it was possible to be 
avoided *'Well ^en,” said the Scots merchant, 
“I'll tell you what we will do ; we will tiy to take 
them prisoners, tie their handb behind them, and 
make them stand still and see their idol destroyed." 
[ 890 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
enough about us, which was used to tieonr fiiewnrks 
together with ; so we resolved to attack the peofde 
first, and with as little noise as we could. The 6rst 
thing we did we knocked at the door, which issued 
just as we desii«d it ; for one of their idol priests 
came to the door. We immediately seized uprni 
him, shaped his mouth, and tied his hands behitod 
him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged him 
that he might not make a noise, tied his mt also 
together, and left him on the ground. 

Two us then waited at the dom-, expecting that 
another would come out to see what the matter was ; 
but we waited so long till the third man came back 
to us, and then nobody coming out, we knocked 
again gently, and immediately out came two more, 
and we serv^ them just in the same manner, but 
were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down 
by the idol some distance from one another; when 
going back we found two more were come out to the 
door, and a thiid stood between them within the 
door. We seized the two, and immediately tied 
them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, 
my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking 
out a composition we had made, that would only 
smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it in 
among them. By that time the other Scotsman and 
my man taking chaige of the two men who were 
already bound, and tied together also by the arm, 
led them away to the idol, and left them there, to 
see if their idol would relieve them, making haste back 
to us. 

When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the but 
with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated, 
we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind,' 
which darned like a candle, and following it in we 
found there was but four people left, who^ it seons,

appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least 
BO as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to 
speak neither for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had 
the others, and all without any noise. I should have 
said we brought them out of the house, or h**!, first ; 
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any 
more than they were. When we had done this, 
we carried them all together to the idol. When we 
came there, we fell to work with him ; and first we 
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar and 
such other stuff as we bad, which was tallow mixed 
with brimstone ; then we stopped his eyes, ears, and 
mouth full of gunpowder ; and then we wrapped up 
a great piece of wild*fire in his bonnet; and then 
sticking all the combustibles we had brought with 
us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find 
anything else to help to bum him ; when my man 
remembered that by the tent or hut, where the men 
were, there lay a heap of diy forage, whether straw 
or rushes I do not remember ; away he and one of 
the Scotsmen ran, and fetched their arms full of that 
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, 
and brought them, having untied their feet and 
ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, 
and set them just before their monstrous idol, and 
thaw set fire to the whole. 

We staved by it a (quarter of an hour or there- 
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and 
ears of the idol blew up, and we could perceive had 
split and deformed the shape, and in a word, till we 
saw it bum into a mere block or log of wood ; and 
then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would 
be quite consumed, when we began to think of going 
away ; but the Scotsman said, ** No, we must not go,

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


for these poor deluded wretches will all throw them* 
selves into the fire, and bum themselves with the 
idol." So we resolved to stay till the forage was 
burnt down too, and then we came away and left 
them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow- 
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our 
ioume" ; nor could any man suggest that we had 
oeen anywhere but iii our beds, as traveHers might 
be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigue 
of that day’s journey. 

But it did not end so. The next day came a 
great multitude of the country people, not only of 
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I 
know, to the town gates, and in a most outrageous 
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian gov- 
ernor for the insulting their priests, and burning 
their great Cham-Chi-l’haungu, such a hard name 
they gave the monstrous creature they worshipped. 
T’he people of Nertchinsk were at first in a great 
consternation ; for they said the Tartars were no less 
than thirty thousand, and that in a few days more 
would be one hundred thousand strong. 

The Russian governor sent out messengers to ap- 
pease them, and gave them all the good words imag- 
inable. He assured them he knew nothing of it, and 
that there had not a soul of his garrison been 
abroad ; that it could not be from anybody there ; 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
should be exemplarily punished. They returned 
haughtily that all the country reverenced the great 
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no 
mortal would have dared to offer violence to his 
image but some Christian miscreant, so they called 
them, it seems ; and they therefore denounced war 
against him and all the Russians, who, they said, 
were miscreants and Christiana 
[2931 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


llw governor, still patient, and unwilling to make 
a bream, or to have any cause of war aHeged to be 
given by him, the Czar having strictly chaiged them 
to treat the conquered country with gentleness and 
civility, mve them still all the good words he could. 
At last he told them there was a caravan gone to- 
wards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some 
Off them who had done them this injury ; and that if 
they would be satisfied with that, he would send 
afbw them, to inquire into it. This seemed to ap- 
pease them a little ; and accordingly the governor 
sent after us, and gave us a particular account how 
the thing was, intimating withal that if any in our 
caravan had done it they should make their escape ; 
but that whether they had done it or no, we should 
nuke all the haste mrward that was 'possible, and 
that in the meantime he would keep them in play as 
long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. However, 
when it came to the caravan there was nobody knew 
anything of the matter ; and as for us that were guilty, 
we were the least of all suspected ; none so much as 
asked us the question. However, the captaiii of the 
caravan for the time took the hint that the governor 
gave us, and we martiied or travelled two days and 
two nights without any considerable stem, and then 
we lay at a village called Plotbiis ; nor aid we make 
any long stop here, but hastened on towards Jera- 
weoa, another the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and 
where we expected we should be safe. But it is to 
be obsei'ved that here we b^an, for two or three 
days' march, to enter upon the vast nameless desert, 
of which I riudl say more in its place, and which if 
we had now been upon it, it is more than probable 
we had been all destroyed. It was the second day's 
march from Plotbus that by the clouds of dust be- 
hind us, at a great distance, some of our people 
[ 294 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


b^an to be sensible we were pursued. We had 
entered the detiert^ and bad passed by a great lake 
jcalled Schaks'Oser, when we perceived a very great 
body of horse appear on the other side oi the 
lake to the north, we travelling west. We observed 
they went away west, as we did, but had supposed 
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas 
we very happily took the south side; and in two 
days more we saw them not, for they, believing we 
were still before them, push^ on till they came to 
the river Uda. This is a very great river when it 
passes farther north, but where we came to it we 
found it narrow and fordable. 


TTie third day they either found their mistake, or 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us 
towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our 
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our 
ramp which was veiy conienicnt for the night ; for 
as we were upon a desert, though but at the begin- 
ning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, 
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected 
none but the city Jerawena, which we had yet two 
days’ march to ; the desert, however, had some few 
woods in it on this side, and little rivers which ran 


all into the great river Uda. It was in a narrow 
strait, between two little but very thick woods, that 
we pitched our little camp for that night, expecting 
to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued 
for ; but as it was usual for the Mongol Tartars to 
go about in troops in that desert, .so the Caravans 
always fortify themselves every night against them 
as against armies of robbers ; and it was, therefore, 
no new thing to be pursued. But we had this night, 
of all the nights of our travels, a most advantageous 
camp ; for we lay between two woods, with a little 
rivulrt running just before our fron^ so that we 
[295J 



ROBINSON CEUSOE 


could not be sutrounded or attacked any way but in 
our firont or rear. We took care also to make our 
fbont as strong as we could by placing our packs, 
with our camas and horses, all in a line on the 
in»de of the river, and felling some trees in our 
rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but 
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our 
situation. They did not come on us like thieves, as 
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to 
demand the meu to be ddivei-ed to them that had 
abused their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi- 
Thaungu with fire, that they might bum them with 
fire : and upon this, they said they would go away, 
and do us no farther harm ; otherwise, they would 
bum us ail with fire. Our men looked very blank 
at this message, and began to stare at one another 
to see who looked with most giiilt in their faces; 
but “ nobody ” was the word, nobody did it. The 
leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured 
it was not done by any of our camp , that we were 
peaceable merchant travelling on our business ; that 
we had done no harm to them, or to any one else ; 
and that, therefore, they must look farther for their 
enemies who had injured them, for we were not the 
people ; so desired them not to disturb us, for if 
they did, we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied wil^ this for 
on answer, but a great crowd of them caine down in 
the morning, by oreak of day, to our camp, but 
seeing us in such an unaccountable situation, they 
durst come no farthei than the brook in our front, 
where they stood and showed us such a number, that 
indeed temfied us very much ; for those that spoke 
least of them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they 
stood and looked at us a while, and then setting up 
a great bowl, they let fl^a crowd of arrows among 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


us ; but we were well enough fortified for that, for 
we sheltered under our baggage ; and I do not re- 
member that one man of us nas hurt. 

Some time after this we saw them move a little to 
our right, and expected them on the rear, when a 
cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of Jera- 
wena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the 
leader of the caravan, said to him, “ I 'll go send all 
these people away to Shilka ; ” this was a city four 
or five da^s' journey at least to the south, and 
rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, 
and getting on horseback, he rides away from our 
rear directly, as it were back to Nertchinsk ; after 
this he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the 
army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express 
to tell them a long story, that the people who had 
burnt the Cham-Chi-'lliaungu were gone to Shilka 
with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that 
is to say, Christians, and that they had resolved to 
bum the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and per- 
fectly spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, 
that they all took it from him, and away they drove 
in a most violent hurry to Shilka, which it seems 
was five days' journey to the north ; and in less than 
three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and 
we never heard any more of them, and we never 
knew whether they went to that other place called 
Shilka or no. So we passed safely on to the city of 
Jerawena, where there was a garrison of Muscovites ; 
and there vie rested five days, the caravan being ex- 
ceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard march, 
and with want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which 
held us three and twenty days’ march. We furnished 
ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom- 
modating ourselves in the night ; and the leader of 
[ 297 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wa^^ns, 
of- the country for carrying our water and provisions ; 
.and these carriages were our defence every night 
round our little camp ; so that had the Taitars ap- 
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, 
thw would not have been able to hurt us. 

' We may well be supposed to want rest again after 
this long journey ; for in this desert we saw abun- 
(huice of the sable-hunters, as they called them. 
These are all Tartars of the Mongol Tartaiw, of 
which this country is a part, and they frequently at- 
tack small caravans ; but we saw no numbers of them 
together. I was curious to see the sable skins the) 
catched, but could never speak with any of them, 
for they dumt not come near us, neither durst we 
stramle from our company to go near them. 

Amr we had passed this desert, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we 
found towns and castles settled by the Czar of Mus- 
covy with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect 
the caravans, and defend the country against the 
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very danger- 
ous travelling ; and his czansh majesty has given 
such strict oiders for the well guarding the caravans 
and merchants, that if there are anv Tartars heard 
of in the country, detachments of tbe garrisons are 
always sent to see the Lravellers safe fiom station to 
station. And thus the governor of Udihsk, whom I 
had opportunity to make a visit to by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of- 
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there 
was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought long liefore this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe we should find the country better peopled, 
and the pmple more civilised ; but I found myself 
mistakoi in both, for we had yet the nation of the 
Tmiguaes to pass through, where we saw the same 
[ 898 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than 
before ; only as they were conquered by the Mus- 
covites, and entirely reduced, they were not so 
dangerous ; but for rudeness of manners, idolatry, 
and multitheism, no people in the world ever went 
beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of 
beasts, and their houses are built of the same. You 
know not a man from a woman, neither by the 
ruggedness of their countenances or their clothes ; 
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
snow, they live undergi-ound, in houses like vaults, 
which have cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham -Chi -Thaungu for a 
whole village or country, these had idols in every but 
and in every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the 
sun, the water, the snow ; and in a word, everything 
that they do not understand — and they understand 
but very little — so that almost every element, every 
uncommon thing, sets them a-sacrificing. 

But I am no more to describe people than countries, 
any farther than my own story comes to be con- 
cerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar to 
myself in this country, which I I'eckon was, from the 
desert which I spoke of last, at least four hundred 
miles, half of it being another desert, which took us 
up twelve days’ severe travelling, without house, or 
tree, or bush, but were obliged again to carry our 
own provisions, as well water as oi'ead. After we 
were out of this desert, and had travelled two days, 
w'e came to Yeniseisk, a Muscovite city or station 
on the great river Yenisei. This river, they told us, 
parted Europe from Asia, though our map-makens 
os I am tola, do not agree to it ; however, it is 
certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia, 
which now niakes up a province only of the vast

the whole empire of Germany.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


And yet here I obiiervod ignorance and paganism 
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite ganisons. 
All the countiy between the river Obi and the river 
Yenisd is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar* 
harous, as the remotest of the Taitaro ; nay, as any 
nation, for ought I know, in Asia or America. 1 
also found, which I observed to the Muscovite 
governors, whom I had opportunity to converse 
with, that the poor pagans are not much the wiser, 
or the nearer Christianity, for being under the Mus- 
covite government, which they acknowledged was 
true enough, but as they said, was none of their 
business ; that if the C/Mr expected to convert his 
Siberian, or Tongusc, or Tartar subjects, it should 
be done by sending cleigyinen among them, not 
soldieix : and they added, with more sincerity than I 
expected, that they found it was nut so much the 
concern of their inonanh to make the people Chris- 
tians, as it was to make them subjects 

From this river to the great iiver Obi we crossed 
a wild and uncultivated country , I cannot say 't is a 
barren soil ; 't is only liarien of jieople, and good 
management, otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, 
fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants 
we found in it are all peigans, except such as are 
sent among them from Russia ; for this is the country, 
I mean on both sides the river Obi, whither the 
Muscovite criminals, that are not put to death, are 
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible 
thCT should ever come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular 
affairs till I came to Tobolsk, the capital city of 
Siberia, where I continued some time on the follow- 
ing occasion. 

vVe had been now almost seven months on our 
journey, and winter be^mn to come on apace, where- 
upon my partner and I called a council almut our

particular aflairs, in which we found it proper, con' 
sidering that we were bound for England, and not 
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. 
They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over 
the snow in the winter-time ; and, indeed, they have 
such things, that it would be incredible to relate the 
particulars of, by which means the Russians travel 
more in the winter than they can in summer, be- 
cause in these sledges they are able to run all night 
and day; the snow being frozen, is one univei^ 
covering to Nature, by which the hills, the vales, 
the rivers, the lakes all are smooth, and hard as a 
stone, and they run upon the surface without any 
regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey 
of this kind. I was bound to England, not to Mos- 
cow, and my route lay two ways ; either I must go 
on, as the caravan went, till I came to Jaroslav, and 
then go off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, 
and so either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I 
might possibly sell my China cargo to good advan- 
tage, or I must leave the caravan at a little town on 
the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water 
to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of 
shipping either to England, Holland, or Hamburg. 

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter 
would have oeen preposterous ; for aa to Dantzic, the 
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get pas- 
sage ; and to go by land in those countries, was far 
less safe than among the Mongol Tartars ; likewise 
to go to Arehangel in October, all the ships would 
be gone from thence, and even the merchants, who 
dwell there in summer, retire south to Moscow in 
the winter when the ships are gone, so that I should 
have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, 
with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in 
an empty town all the winter; so that, upon the

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


whole* 1 thought it a much better wav to let the 
carwvao go, and to make provision to winter where 
I was, viz., at Tobolsk, in Siberia, in the latitude of 
(fifty-dght] degrees, where I was sure of three things 
to wear out a cold winter with, viz., plenty of pro- 
vision, such as the country affoided, a warm house, 
with fuel enough, amd excellent company ; of all 
which I shall give a full account in its place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my 
beloved island, where I nei'er felt cold, except when 
I had my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do 
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any 
fire but without doors, and for my necessity, in dress- 
ing my fo(xl, &c. Now I mode me three good vests, 
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down 
to the TMt, and button close to the wrists, and all 
tliese lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis- 
liked our way in England of making fires in every 
roqpi in the house, in open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, alway.s kept the air in the room 
cold as the climate ; but taking an apartment in a 

E l house in the town, I oitlered a chimney to be 
t like a furnace, in the centre of six several 
rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to can v the smoke 
went up one way, the door to come at the fire went 
in another, ana all the rooms were kept equally 
warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat tne bagnios 
in England. 

By this means we had always the same climate in 
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and 
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm 
within ; and yet we saw no fire, nor was incommoded 
with any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it 
should be possible to meet with good company 
here, in a country so barbarous as that of the most

northerly parts of Europe, near the Frozen ocean', 
and within but a very few degrees of Nova 2emUa. 

But this being the country where the state crim- 
inals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all 
banished, this city was full of noblemen, princes, 
gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the 
nobility, gentiy, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. 
Here was the famous Prince Galliozen, the old 
General Robostiski, and several other persons of 
note, and some ladies. 

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe- 
less, I parted with here, 1 made an acquaintance 
here with several of these gentlemen, and some of 
them of the first rank ; and from these in the long 
winter nights in which I stayed here I received 
several very agreeable visits. It was talking one 
night with Prince one of the banished min- 

isters of state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, 
that my talk of my particular case began. He had 
been telling me abundance of fine things of the 
greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the 
absolute power of the Emperor of the Russians. I 
inteiTupted him, and told him I was a greater and 
more powerful prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy 
was, though my dominions were not so large, or my 
people so many. The Russian grandee looked a 
little surprised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon 
me, began to wonder what I meant. 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had ex- 
plained myself. First, I told him I had the absolute 
disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects ; 
that notwithstanding my absolute power, I had not 
one person disaffected to my government or to my 
person in all my dominions. He shook his head at 
that, and said, there indeed I outdid the Czar of 
Muscovy. I told him that all the lands in my 
kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were not

would all fight for me to the last drop ; and that 
never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, 
waa ever so universally beloved, and yet so horribly 
fbared, by his subjects. 

After amusing them with these riddles in wvem- 
ment for a while, 1 opened the case, and told them 
the story at large of my living in the island, and 
how I managed lioth myself and the people there 
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it 
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, 
and especially the prince, who told me with a sigh 
that the true greatness of life was to be master of 
ourselves I that he would nut have exchanged such 
a state of life as mine to have been Czar of Muscovy ; 
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found 
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his master the Czai- ; that the height of human wis- 
dom was to bring our tempera down to our circum- 
stances, and to make a calm within, under the weight 
of the greatest storm without. When he came first 
hither, he said, he used to tear the hair from bis 
head, and the clothes from his bock, as others had 
done before him, but a little time and considera- 
tion had made him look into himself, as well as 
round him, to things without; that he found the 
mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect 
upon the state of univeraal life, and how little this 
world was concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly 
capable of making a felicity for itself, fully satisfy- 
ing to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and 
desires, with but very little assistance from the 
worid ; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise in order 
to health, completed, in bis opinion, all that the 
world couid do for us; and though the greatness,

the 'authoiHtVi the riches, and the pleasures which 
some enjoyed in the world, and which. he had en* 
joyed his share of, had much in them that was 
agreeable to us, yet he observed that all those thinra 
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our aflections, su^ 
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, 
our vanity, and our sensuality; all which were, 
indeed, the mere product of the worst part of man, 
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the 
seeds of all manner of crimes ; but neither were re- 
lated to, or concerned with, any of those virtues that 
constituted us wise men, or of those graces which 
distinguished us as Christians ; that *being now de- 
prived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in 
the full exercise of all those vices, be said he was 
at leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where 
he found all manner of deformity ; and was now 
convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, 
rich, and great, and preserves him in the way to a 
superior happiness in a future state ; and in this, he 
said, they were more happy in their banishment than 
all their enemies were, who had the full possession 
of all the wealth and power that they, the oanished, 
had left behind them. 

“ Nor, sir,” says he, “ do I bring my mind to this 
politically by the necessity of my circumstances, 
which some call miserable ; but if I know anything 
of myself, I would not now go back, though the 
CzEir, my master, should call me, and reinstate me 
in all my former grandeur ; I say, 1 would no more 
go back to it, than I believe my soul, when it shall 
be delivered from this prison of the body, and has 
had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, would 
come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now 
inclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and 
crime of human affairs.”

00 latidi earnestne0s and motion of his spirits, which 
wene apparent in his countenance, that it was evident 
it was toe true sense of his soul ; there was no room 


to doubt his sincerity. 

1 told him I once thought myself a kind of a 
monan'h in my old station, of which I had given him 
an account, but that I thought he was not a monarch 
onl^, but a great conqueror , for that he that has got 
a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the 
absolute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely 
governs his will, is c'ertainly greater than he that 
conquers a city. “ But, my lord," said I, “ shall I 
take the liberty to ask you a question — “With 
all my heart," says he. — “ If the door of your liberty 
was opened," said I, “ would \ ou not take hold of it 
to deliver yourself from this exile ? " 

“Hold,’’^ said he, “jour question is subtle, and 
requires some serious just distinctions to give it a 
sincere answer, and I 'll give it you from the bot- 
tom of my heart Nothing that I know of in this 
world would move me to deliver myself from this 
state of banishment, except these two , first, the en- 
joyment of niy relations; and, secondly, a little 
warmer climate. But I protest to \ou, that to go 
back to the pomp of the court, the ghny, the power, 
the hurry of a minister of state, the wealtn, the 
gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a 
courtier; if my master should send me word this 
moment that he restores me to all he banished me 
from, I protest, if I know myself at all, I would not 
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen 
lakes, for the palace at Moscow." 


“"But, my lord," said I, "perhaps you not only 
are banishra from the pleasure or the court, and 
^m the power, and authority, and wealth, you en- 
jwed before, but you may be absent too from some 
of the conveniences of life^our estate, perhaps, con- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


fiscated, and your effects plundered ; and the supplies 
left you here may not oe suitable to the orainaiy 
demands of life." 

“ Ay," says he, “ that is, as you suppose me to be 
a lord, or a prince, &c. So indeed 1 am ; but you 
are now to consider me only as a man, a human crea- 
ture, not at all distinguished from another ; and so 
I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited with 
sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques- 
tion out of dispute, you see our manner ; we are in 
this place five persons of rank; we live perfectly 
retires!, as suited to a state of banishment ; we have 
something rescued from the shipwreck of our for- 
tunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of 
hunting for our rood ; but the poor soldiers who are 
here, without that help, live in as much plenty as 
we, who go into the woods and catch sables and 
foxes ; the labour of a month will maintain them a 
vear, and as the way of living is not expensive, so 
it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves ; so that 
objection is out of doors." 

I have not room to give a full account of the most 
agreeable convei'sation I had with this truly great 
man, in all which he showed that his mind was so 
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup- 

S orted by religion as well as by a vast share of wis- 
om, that his contempt of the world was really as 
much as he had expressed, and that he was always 
the same to the last, as will appear in the stoiy I am 
going to tell. 

1 had been here eight months, and a dark, dread- 
ful winter I thought it to be, the cold so intense, 
that I could not so much as look about without be- 
ing wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my 
face, or rather a hood, with only a bole for breath, 
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was, 
as we reckons, for three months, not above five 
[ 807 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


hoars a dav, and six at most ; only that the snow 
lying on the ground continually, and the weather 
clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were 
kept, or rather starved, underground; and as for 
our servants, for we hired three servants here to 
look after our horses and belves, we had every now 
and then their dngers and toes to thaw, and take care 
of, lest tliey should mortify and fall oif. 

It is true withiu doors we ucrc warm, the houses 
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the 
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh 
of deer, dried and cuied in the season ; good bread 
enough, but hak«;d as biscuits , dried fish of several 
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes, 
which is pretty good lieef. All the stores of provi- 
sion for the winter are laid up m the summer, and 
well cured. Our dniik was water mixed with aqua- 
vjtsc instead of brandy . and for a treat, mead instead 
of wine, which, however, they have excellent good. 
The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, fre- 
quently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and 
good ; and soinetiincN lieai’s flesh, but we did not 
much care for the last. Wc had a good stock of 
tea, with which we treated our friends, as above; 
and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully and well 
all things considered. 

It was now March and the days grown consider- 
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable, so 
the other travellers began to prepare sleds to carry 
them over the snow, and to get things i-eady to be 
going; but my measuies being fixed, as I have said, 
for Archangel, and not to Muscovy or the Baltic, I 
made no motion, knowing very well that the ships 
from the south do not set out for tliat pait of the 
world till May or June, and that if I was there by 
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any 
ships would be readv to go away, and therefore. I

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


say, I, made no haste to be gone, as others did ; in a 
word, I saw a great many people — nay, all the 
travellers — go away before me. It seems evmy year 
they go from hence to Moscow for trade, viz., to ctaty 
furs and buy necessaries with them, which they bring 
back to furnish their shops ; also others went of the 
same errand to Archangel, but then they also, being 
to come back again above eight hundrea miles, went 
all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, 
it occuri'ed to me that seeing all these people were 
banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet 
when they came there were left at liberty to go 
whither they would, why did they not then go away 
to any part of the worm wherever they thought fit ? 
and I mgan to examine what should hinder them 
from making such an attempt. 

But ray wonder was over when I entered upon 
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who 
answered me thus : “ Consider first, sir," said he, 
“ the place where we are, and secondly, the condition 
we are in ; especially,” said he, “ the generality' of 
the pecmle who are banished hither. We are sur- 
rounded,” said he, “ with stronger things than bars 
and bolts ; on the north side an unnavigable ocean, 
where ship never sailed, and boat never swam , neither, 
if we had both, could we know where to go with them. 
Every other way,” said he, “ we have above a thousand 
miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and 
by ways utterly unpassable except by the roads made 
by the governor, and by the towns garrisoned by his 
troops, so that we could neither pass undiscovered 
by the road, or subsist any other way, so that it is in 
vain to attempt it.” 

I was silenc^ indeed at once, and found that they 
were in a prison every jot as secuie as if they had 
[ 809 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


been locked up in the castle at Moscow. However, 
H CMoe into tnj thought that I might certainly be 
made an instrument to pitx^ure the escape of this 
excellent person, and that whatever liazara I ran, I 
would cerimnly try if I could cany him off. Upon 
this 1 took an occasion one evening to tell him my 
thoughts. I represented to him that it was very 
easy for me to carry him awav, there being no guard 
over him in the country ; and as I was not going to 
Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the 
nature of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to 
lie in tlie stationary towns in the desert, but could 
encamp every night where I would, we might easily 
|>as8 uninterrupted to Archangel, where I would 
immediately secure him on biiard an English or 
Dutch ship and carry him off safe along with me , 
and as to his subsistence and other particulars, it 
should be my care till he could better supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and IcMiked earnestly 
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his 
very-f^e that what I said put his spirits into an 
excxedine ferment ; his colour frequently changed, 
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it 
might be even perceived in his countenance, nor 
could he immediately answer me when I had done, 
and, as it were, ex[iected what he would say to it ; 
but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, 
and said, « How happy are we, unguarded creatui-es 
as we are, that even our ^atest acts of friendship 
are made snares to us, and we aie made tempters of 
one another ! My dear friend,” said he, “ your offer 
is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinter- 
ested in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, 
ttat I must have veiy little knowledge pf the world 
if I did not both wonder at it and acknowl^ge the 
oblimtion I have upon me to you for it But did

to you of my contempt of the world? Did vou 
believe I spoke my very soul to vou, and that I Wl 
really obtained that degree of felicity here, that had 

S laced me above all that the world could give me, or 
o for me ? Did you believe I was sincere when I 
told you I would nut go back, if I was recalled even 
to all that once I was in the court, with the favour 
of the Czar tny master? Did you believe me, my 
friend, to be an honest man P or did you think me 
to be a boasting hypocrite ? ” Here ne stopped ^ 
if he would hear what I would say ; but indeed I 
soon after perceived that he stopped because his 
spirits were in motion , his great heart was full of 
sti'uggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, 
astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I 
used some arguments with him to urge him to set 
himself free ; that he ought to look upon this as a 
door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
summons by Providence, who has the care and dis- 
position of all events, to do himself good, and to 
render himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. “ How do 
you know, sir,” says he warmly, “ that instead of a 
summons from Heaven it may not be a feint of an- 
other instrument, repiesenting in all the alluring 
colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance, 
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly 
to my ruin ? Here I am, free from the temptation 
of returning to my former miserable matness ; there 
I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, am- 
bition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in 
nature, may revive and take root, and in a word, 

X in overwhelm me ; and then the happy prisoner,

of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in

of life, niher than purchase a show of fi'eedom at 
the expense of the lioerty of my reason, and at the 
expense of the future happiness which now I have in 
my “view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight 
of; •tor I am but flesh, a man, a mere man, have 
passions and aflcctiont as likely to possess and over- 
throw me as any man Oh, be not my friend and 
my tempter both together ! ” 

If I was surprised Ijefore, I was quite dumb now, 
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed admired 
at what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so 
great, that though the weather was extremely cold 
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he 
waut«l to give vent to his mind ; so I said a word or 
two, that 1 would leave him to consider of it, and 
wait on him again, and then 1 withdrew to my own 
apartment. 

About two hours after I heard somebody at or 
near the door of my room, and I was goin^ to open 
the door ; but he hod opened it, and came in. “ My 
dear friend,” says he, “you had almost overeet me, 
but I am recovered, do not take it ill that I do 
not clo>)e with your offer , I assure j’ou ’t is not for 
want of a sense of the kindness of it in you, and I 
came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it 
to you ; but I hope I have got the victory over 
myself.” 

“ My lord," said I, “ I hope you are fully satisfied 
that you do not resist the call of Heaven.” — “ Sir,” 
said ne, “if it had been from Heaven, the same 
Power would have influenced me to accept it; but I 
hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven 
that I decline it ; and I have an infinite satisfaction 
in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest 
man stul, though not a free man.” 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make 
professions to him of my having no cud in it but a

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me vei^ 
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, 
and should, always acknowledge it ; and with that 
he offered me a very fine present of sables, too mudi 
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum- 
stances; and I would have avoided them, but be 
would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord- 
ship with a small present of tea and two pieces of 
China damask and four little wedges of Japan mid, 
which did not all weigh above six ounces or there- 
about, but were far short of the value of his sables, 
which indeed when I came to England I found worth 
near £200. He accepted the tea and one piece of 
the damask and one of the pieces of gold, which had 
a fine stamp upon it of the Japan coinage, which I 
found he trok for the rarity of it, but would not 
take any more, and he sent word by my servant that 
he desired to speak with me. 

When 1 came to him, he told me I knew what 
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move 
him any more in that affair ; but that since I had 
made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I 
had kindness enough to offer the same to another 
person that he would name to me, in whom he had 
a great share of concern. I told him that I could 
not s^ I inclined to do so much for any one but him- 
self, for whom I had a particular value, and should 
have been glad to have been the instrument of his 
deliverance. However, if be would please to name 
the person to me, I would give him my answer, and 
hoped he would not be displeased with me if he was 
with my answer. He told me it was only his son, 
whom, though I had not seen, yet was in the same 
condition with himself, and above two hundred miles 
from him, on the other side the Obi ; but that if I 
consented, he would send for him. 

[818] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


I nuuilt no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 
I madb some oeremony in letting him understand 
that it was wholly on his account and that seeing I 
could not prevail on him, I would show my respect 
to him by my concern for his son ; but these things 
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the 
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he 
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
bOTses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the 
whole, amounted to a very great value. His ser- 
vants brought the horses into the town, but left the 
young lorn at a distance till night, when he came 
incognito into our apartment, and his father pre- 
senteti him to me, and in short, we concerted there 
the manner of our travelling, and everything proper 
for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, 
black f9X-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as 
are very rich ; I say, I had bought them in that city in 
exchange for some of the goods I brought from China ; 
in particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I 
sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards 
at Archangel, for a much better price than I could 
have done at London , and my partner, who was 
sensible of the profit, and whose business, more par- 
ticularly than mine, was n'erchandise, was mightily 
pleased with our stay on account of the traffic we 
made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this re- 
mote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the 
world.; and inde^ it is so far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it should be much 
talked of. We wexie now come to a very small cara- 
van, being °nly thirty-two horses and camels in all, 
and all of them paswd for mine, though nre new 
guest was pronrietor of eleven of them. It was 
most natural also that I should take more servants

with me than I had before, and the young lord 
passed for my steward ; what gr^t man 1 passed for 
myself 1 know not, neith^ did it concern me to in*- 
quire. We had here the worst and the largest desert 
to pass over that we met with in all the journey ; 
indeed I call it the worst, because the way was very 
deep in some places, and very uneven in others ; the 
best we had to say for it was, that we thought we 
had no troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and 
that they never came on this side the Obi, or at 
least but very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite 
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per- 
fectly acquainted with the country, and led us by 
private roads that we avoided coming into the prin- 
cipal towns and cities upon the great road, such 
as Tuimen, Solikamsk, and several others, b^use 
the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are 
very curious and strict in their observation upon 
travellers, and searching lest any of the banisned 
persons of note shoidd make their escape that way 
into Muscovy ; but by tJiis means, as we were kept 
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, 
and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, 
when we might have had very good accommodation 
in the cities on the way. This the young loixl was 
so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie 
abroad when we came to several cities on the way, 
but lay abroad bimself with his servant in the woods, 
and met us always at the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the 
river Kama, which in these parts is toe boundary 
between Europe and Asia ; and the first city on the 
European side was called Solikamsk, which is as 
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama ; 
and here we thought to have seen some evident al> 
teration in the people, their manner, their habit,

tbeir rdigioa, and their businessi ; but »e were mis* 
taken ; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which by 
relation is near seven hundred miles long in some 
places, but not above two hundred miles oyer where 
we passed it, so till «e came past that horrible place 
we found very little difference between that country 
md the Mongol Tai-tary , the people most pagans, 
and Httle better than the savages of America ; their 
bouses and towns full of idolii, and their way, of liv- 
ing wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, and 
the Tillages near them ; where there are Christians, 
as they call themselves of the Greek Church, but 
have their religion mingled with so many relics of 
superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some 
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, es- 
caped, as before, have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered, bv a troop of thieves ; of what 
country they were, whether the roving bands of the 
Ostiaks, a kind of Taitars, or wild people on the 
bank of the Obi, and ranged thus far, or whether 
they were the sable-huntere of Siberia, I am yet at 
a loss to know ; but they were all on horseback, 
carried hows and arrows, and weie at first about five 
and forty in number. They came so near to us as 
within about two musket-shot ; and asking no ques- 
tions, they surrounded us with their horse, and 
look^ very earnestly upon us tw’ice. At length 
they placed themselves just in our way, upon which 
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being 
not above sixteen men in all ; and heinjg drawn up 
thus we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant 
who attended his loi-d to see who they were. His 
master was the more willing to let him go, becau.se 
he was not a little apprehensive that they were a 
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came 
[3161 



BOBINSON CHUSOE 


up near them with a flag of truce, and called them ; 
but though be spoke several of their languages, or 
dialects of langui^s rather, he could not undetstam} 
a word they said. However, after some signs to 
him not to come nearer to them at bis peril, so he 
said he understood them' to mean, oflering to shoot 
at him if he advanced, the fellow came ba^ no wiser 
than he went, only that by their dress, he said he 
believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of 
Circassian hordes ; and that there must be more of 
them upon the great desert, though he never heard 
that any of them ever were seen so far north before. 
This was small comfort to us ; however, we had 
no remedy. There was on our left hand, at about a 
quarter oif a mile's distance, a little gi-ove or clump 
of trees, which stood close together, and very near 
the road. I immediately resolved we would advance 
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we 
could there ; for first, I considered that the trees 
would in a gi^t measure cover us from their arrows ; 
and in the next place, the^ could not come to charge 
us in a body. It was indeed my old Portuguese 
pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency 
attending him, namely, that he was always readiert 
and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of 
the most danger. We advanced immediately with 
what speed we could and gained that little wood, 
the Tartars, or thieves, for we know not what to call 
them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to 
hinder us. When we came thither, we found to our 
great satisfaction that it was a swampy, springy 
piece of ground, and on the one side a very great 
spring of water, which running out in a little rill 
or brook, was a little &rther joined by another of 
the like bigness, and was, in short, the head or 
source of a considerable river, called afterwards the 
Wirtska. The trees which grew about this spring

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


were not in all above two hundred, but were very 
large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we 
got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from tbe 
enemy, unless they alighted and attacked us on foot. 
But to make this more difficult our Portuguese, with 
indefatigaUe application, <iut down great arms of 
the trees, and laid them hanging, not quite cut off, 
from one tree to another, so that he made a con- 
tinued fence almost round us. 

We stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy 
some hours, without perceiving they made any mo- 
tion ; when, about two hours before night, they 
came down directly upon us; and though we had 
net perceived it, we found they had been joined by 
some more of the same, so that they were near four- 
score horse, whei'eof, however, «c fancied some were 
women. They came on till they were within half 
diot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 
without ball, and called to them in the Russian 
tongue to know what they wanted, and bid them 
keep off; but as if they knew nothing of what we 
said, they came on with a double fury directly up to 
the wood-side, not imagining we were so barricaded 
that they could not break in. Our old pilot was 
our captain, as well as he had been our engineer, and 
desirea of us not to fire upon them till they came 
within pistol-shot, and that we might be sure to kill, 
and that when we did fire we shoidd be sure to take 
good aim. We bade him give the word of com- 
mand, which he delayed so long that they were, 
some of them, within two pikes' length of us when 
we fired. 

We aimed so true, or Providence directed our shot 
so sure, that we killed fourteen of them and wounded 
several others, as also several of their horses ; for we 
had all of us loaded our pieces with two or three 
bidlets at least 

[ 818 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


They were terribly surprised with our &re, and 
retreatra immediately about one hundred rods from 
us, in which time we loaded our pieces again, and 
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and 
catched four or nve of their horses, whose riders, we 
suppose, were killed ; and coming up to the dead, we 
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not 
from what country, or how they came to make an 
excursion such an unusual length. 

About an hour after they made a motion to attack 
us again, and rode round our little wood to sec where 
else they might break in ; but finding us always 
ready to face them, they went off again, and we 
resolved not to stir from the place for that night. 

We slept little you may be sure, but spent the 
most part of the night in strengthening our situation, 
and mrricading the entrances into the wood, and 
keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, 
and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome dis- 
covery indeed ; for the enemy, whom we thought 
were discouraged with the reception they had met 
with, were now increased to no less than three hun- 
dred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, 
as if they were resolved to besiege us ; and this little 
camp they had pitched upon the open plain, at about 
three-quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed 
surprise at this discovery; and now, I confess, I 
gave myself over for lost, and all that 1 had. The 
loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though they 
were very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into 
the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my 
journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as 1 
nad gone through, and even in sight of our port, 
where we expectra safety and deliverance. As for my 
partner, he was raging; he declared that to lose his 
goods would be his ruin, and he would rather die than 
be starved, and he was for fighting to the kst drop. 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 

The youiig' lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed 
tksdft was fi>r fighting to the last also ; and^ my old 
jtikit *as of the opinion we were able to resist them 
all in tile situation we were then in, and thus we spent 
the day in debates of what we should do ; but towai^ 
evening we found that the number of our enemies 
■till increased. Perhaps, us they were abroad in sev- 
eral parties for prey, the first had sent out scouts to 
call ^ help, and to acquaint them of the booty ; and 
we did not know but by the morning they might still 
be a greater number ; so I began to inquire of those 
people we had brought from Tobolsk if there was 
no other, or more private ways, by which we might 
avoid them in the night, and perhaps either retreat to 
some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. 

The Sibenan, who was servant to the young lord, 
told us if we designed to avoid them and not fight, 
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a 
way that went north towards the Petrov, by which 
he made no question but we might get away, and 
the Tartars never the wiser, but he said his lord had 
told him he would not retreat, but would rather 
choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord, for 
that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the 
sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave enough 
by what he had showed already ; but that his lord 
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or 
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoid- 
ame necessity forced them to it ; and that if he 
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we 
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He 
answered, if his lord gave him such orders, he would 
lose his life if he did not perform it. We soon 
brought his loid to give that order, though privately, 
and we immediately prepaied for the putting it in 
practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark we kin-

KOBINSON CRUSOE 


died a Sre in oar little camp, which we kept bunting, 
and prepared so as to make it bum tJl night, that 
the Tartars might conclude we were still there ; but 
as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we could 
see the stars, for our guide would not stir before, 
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we 
followed our new guide, who, I soon found, steered 
himself by the pole or noiih star, all the country 
being level for a long wav. 

After we bad travelled two hours very hard it 
b^an to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark 
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in a 
word, it was rather lighter than we wi^ed it to be ; 
by six o'clock the next morning we were gotten near 
forty miles, though the tmth is we almost spoiled 
our horses. Here we found a Russian village named 
Kermaziuskoy p Kertchernskoy], where we rested, 
and heard notning of the Kalmuck Tartars that 
day. About two hours before night we set out 
again, and travelled till eight the next morning, 
though not quite so quiet as before; and about 
seven o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza, 
and came to a good large town inhabited by Rus- 
sians, and very populous, called Ozomoys [?]. There 
we heard that several troops or hordes of Kalmucks 
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were 
now completely out of danger of them, which was to 
our great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we 
were obliged to get some fresh horses, and having 
need enough of rest, we stayed five days ; and my 
partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian 
who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles for 
his conducting us. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima upon 
the river Vychegda, and running into the Dwina ; 
we were there very happily near the end of our 
travels by land, that river ming navigable in seven

day*' puutte to A wtiang p]. From hence we came 
to Lawretmoy [? Jarenskj the 8rd of J uly, and pro- 
viding ourselves with two luggage-boats and a baige 
for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and 
airived all safe at Archangel the 18th, having been 
a year and five months and three days on the jour- 
ney, including our stay of eight months and odd 
days at Tobmsk. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks 
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried 
longer had not a Hambur^r come in above a month 
sooner than any of the English ships, when, after 
some consideration that the city of Hamburg might 
happen to be as good a market for our goods as 
London, we all took freight with him; and having 
put my goods on board, it was most natural for me 
to put my steward on board to take c»re of them, by 
which means my young lord had a sufficient oppor- 
tunity to concern himself, never coming on shore in 
all the time we stayed there ; and this he did, that 
he might not be seen in the city, where some of the 
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and 
discoveied him. 

We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August the 
same year, and after no extraordinary bad voyage 
arrived in the Elbe the ISth of September, fiere 
my partner and I found a very gciod sale for our 
goods, as well those of China as the sables, &c., of 
Siberia ; and dividing the produce of our effects, my 
shm amounted to jf’3475, 17s. 8d., notwithstanding 
so many losses we had sustained, and charges we had 
been at ; only remembering that I bad included in 
this about six hundred pounds' worth of diamonds, 
which I bod purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
wait up the Elbe in order to go to the court of 
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and

where he could correspond with those of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude 
for the service I had done him, and his sense of my 
kindness to the prince his father. 

To conclude. Having stayed near four months 
in Hambuig, I came from thence overland to the 
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived 
in London the 10th of January 1705, having been 
gone from England ten years and nine months. 

And here resolving to harass myself no more, I am 
preparing for a longer journey than all these, having 
lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, and 
learnt sufficiently to know the value of retiiement, 
and the blessing of ending our days in peace.
