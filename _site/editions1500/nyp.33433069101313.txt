PREFACE.
TDROGRESS and improvement characterize almost every art and
.*. science; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic
has received many important additions and improvements, which
have appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises
published upon this subject.
In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to
combine, and to present in one harmonious whole, all these modern
improvements, as well as to introduce some new methods and prac-
tical operations not found in other works of the same grade; in short,
to present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science
than an art; to teach him methods of thought, and how to reason,
rather than lohat to do; to give unity, system, and practical utility to
the science and art of computation.
The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the
privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the
thinking and the labor necessary to the study of Arithmetic; hence
the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of
"notes," "suggestions," and superfluous operations so common to
most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the
cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that
vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind.
The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not supe-
riority over, others of the kind in the following particulars, viz.: In
the mechanical and typographical style of the work; the open and
attractive page; the progressive and scientific arrangement of the
subjects; clearness and conciseness of definitions; fullness and accu-
racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses;
brevity and perspicuity of rules; and in the very large number of
examples prepared and arranged with special reference to their prac-
tical utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The
iV PREFACE
answers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner
may acquire the discipline resulting from verifying the operations.
Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of
Common Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Pro-
portion, Analysis, Alligation, and the Roots, as it is believed these
articles contain some practical features not common to other authors
upon these subjects.
The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial
changes of the last few years are especially noticeable. The different
kinds of United States Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are
described, and their comparative value in commercial transactions
illustrated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and
Currency, and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in
trade, are taught and illustrated, and many other things that every
commercial student and business man ought to know and understand.
It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is im-
possible; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific,
comprehensive, and complete system, sufficiently full for the busi-
ness man and the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories,
and yet combining and systematizing real improvements of a practical
and useful nature. How nearly this end has been attained the intel-
ligent and experienced teacher and educator must determine.
The Author.
NOTICE.
This book has been newly electrotyped in the latest and best style
of typography. No change has been made in the text, except to cor-
rect positive errors, drop a few obsolete terms from the tables, and in
place of " Gold Investments" and the Colonial Currency of shillings
and pence, some practical matter has been substituted.
These improvements are designed to give new life to a book that
has proved its real merits by the very large circulation it has obtained.

DEFINITIONS.
1. Quantity is any thing that can be increased, dimin
Ished, or measured.
2. Mathematics is the science of quantity.
3. A Unit is one, or a single thing.
4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units.
5. An Integer is a whole number.
6. The Unit of a Number is one of the collection of
units forming the number. Thus, the iCnit of 23 is 1; of
23 dollars, 1 dollar; of 23 feet, 1 foot.
7. Like Numbers are numbers that have the same kind
of unit. Thus, 74,16, and 250; 7 dollars and 62 dollars;
4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches.
8. An Abstract Number is a number used without
reference to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17;
365; 8540.
9. A Concrete Number is a number used with refer-
ence to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars;
365 days; 8540 men.
1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and is called Unity.
2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Numbers. Denomination
means the name of the unit of a concrete number.
10. Arithmetic ia the Science of numbers, and the Art
»f computation.
11. A Sign is a character used to indicate an operation,
»r for abbreviating an expression.
12. A Rule is a prescribed method for performing an
operation.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
NOTATION AND NUMEKATION.
13. Notation is a method of writing or expressing num-
bers by characters.
14. Numeration is a method of reading numbers ex
pressed by characters.
15. Two systems of notation are in general use—thw
Roman and the Arabic.
The Roman Notation is supposed to have been first nsed by the Romans; hence
Its name. The Arabic Notation was introduced into Europe by the Arabs, by wh*m
it was supposed to have been invented. But investigations have shown that it was
adopted by them about 600 years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin-
doos more than 2000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes called the Indian
Notation.
The Roman Notation.
16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers.
Thus,
Letters. I V X L C D M
Values. One. Five. Ten. Fifty. ^ared. hundred- thousand.
17. The Roman Notation is founded upon five principles,
as follows:
1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre-
sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred.
2d. If a letter of any value is placed after one of greater
value, its value is to be added to that of the greater. Thus,
XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred.
3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater
value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater.
Thus, IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred.
Define notation. Numeration. What systems of notation are now
in general use 1 From what are their names derived? What are used
to express numbers in the Roman notation 1 What is the value of
each? What ia the first principle of combination? Second? Third?

4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters,
each of greater value, its value is to be taken from the sum
of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen, XXIX
twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four.
5th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value
one thousand times. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou-
sand; L fifty, and L fifty thousand.

The system of Boman notation is not well adapted to the purposes of numerical
calculation; it is principally confined to the numbering of chapters and sections of
books, public documents, etc.
Express the following numbers by letters:
1. Eleven. Ans.
2. Fifteen. Ans.

7. One hundred fifty-nine.
8. Five hundred ninety-four.
9. One thousand five hundred thirty-eight.
10. One thousand nine hundred ten.
11. Express the present year.
The Arabic Notation.
18. Employs ten characters or figures to express num-
bers. Thus,
Figures. 0123 450789
Names. Cipher. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
19. The first character, or cipher, is called naught, be-
cause it has no value of its own. The other nine characters
are called significant figures, because each has a value of its
own.
20. The significant figures are also called Digits, a word
derived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies finger.
21. The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero.
The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic,
and by combining them according to certain principles, all
numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most
important of these principles.*
22. Each of the nine digits has a value of its own.
hence any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by
one figure.
* Fractional and decimal notation, and the notation of compound numbers, will
be discussed in their appropriate places.
What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation 1 What
is the value of each? What general name is given to the significant
figures t Why? Numbers less than ten, how expressed?
23. As there is no single character to represent ten, we
express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0,
thus, 10. In the same manner we represent
2 tens,
3 tens,
4 tens,
5 tens,
6 tens,
7 tens,
8 tens,
9 tens.

24. When a number is expressed by two figures, the right
hand figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens.
We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing
the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respec-
tively in the place of units. Thus,

In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and
30, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens.
Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93.
The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures
is 99.
25. We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left
hand of one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write
two hundred, three hundred, etc., to nine hundred. Thus,
One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nino
hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred,
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900.
26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the
right hand figure is called units, the second figure, tens, and
the left hand figure, hundreds.
As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are
always used to denote the absence of value in the places they

occupy, we express tens and units with hundreds, by writ-
ing, in place of the ciphers, the numbers representing the
tens and units. To express one hundred fifty we write 1
hundred, 5 tens, and 0 units; thus, 150. To express seven
hundred ninety-two, we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2
units; thus,
ell

The greatest number that can be expressed by three figures
is 999.
Examples for Practice.
1. Write one hundred twenty-five.
2. Write four hundred eighty-three.
3. Write seven hundred sixteen.
4. Express by figures nine hundred.
5. Express by figures two hundred ninety.
6. Write eight hundred nine.
7. Write five hundred five.
8. Write five hundred fifty-seven.
27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at the left
hand of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of
one cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two
thousand, three thousand, etc., to nine thousand; thus,
One Two Three Four Fiye Six Seven Eight Nine
thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousands
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000.
28. When a number is expressed by four figures, the
places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hun-
dreds, thousands.
Use of the cipher, what? Greatest number that can be expressed by
three figures 1 One thousand, how expressed? How many figure*
used? Names of each?
To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, wo
write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish
to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun-
dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in
the place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the
place of units; thus,
P w S S

The greatest number that can be expressed by four figures
is 9999.
Examples for Practice.
Express the following numbers by figures:
1. One thousand two hundred.
2. Five thousand one hundred sixty.
3. Three thousand seven hundred forty-one.
4. Eight thousand fifty-six.
5. Two thousand ninety.
6. Seven thousand nine.
7. One thousand one.
8. Nine thousand four hundred twenty-seven.
9. Four thousand thirty-five.
10. One thousand nine hundred four.
Read the following numbers:
11. 76; 128; 405; 910; 116; 3416; 1025
12. 2100; 5047; 7009; 4670; 3997; 1001.
29. Next to thousands come tens of thousands, and next
to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds
come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, 1, one place to the left of the place
Greatest number expressed by four figures? Tens of thousands,
how expressed? Hundreds of thousands t
'
of thousands, or by writing it at the left hand of four
ciphers; thus, 10000; and one hundred thousand is ex-
pressed by removing the unit, 1, still one place further to
the left, or by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers;
thus, 100000. We can express thousands, tens of thou-
sands, and hundreds of thousands in one number, in tho
same manner as we express units, tens, and hundreds in ono
number To express five hundred twenty-one thousand
eight hundred three, we write 5 in the sixth place, counting
from units, 2 in the fifth place, 1 in the fourth place, 8 in
the third place, 0 in the second place (because there are no
tens), and 3 in the place of units; thus,

20. 200200; 75620; 90402; 218094; 100101.
For convenience in reading large numbers, point them off,
by commas, into periods of three figures each, counting from
the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables us to
read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with
facility.
30. Next above hundreds of thousands we have, succes-
sively, units, tens, and hundreds of millions, and then fol-
low units, tens, and hundreds of each higher name, as seen
in the following:

31. Figures occupying different places in a number, as
units, tens, hundreds, etc., are said to express different
orders of units.
Simple units are called units of the first order.
Tens "" " "" second"
Hundreds "" " "" third"
Thousands "" " ""fourth"
Tens of thousands" " " ""fifth
and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order,
5 units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order.
1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order (millions), 3
units of the fifth order (tens of thousands), and 6 units of
the third order (hundreds).
Examples for Practice.
"Write in figures, and read the following numbers:
1. One unit of the third order, four of the second.
2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of
the first.
3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second.
4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four
of the third, one of the second, seven of the first.
5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second.
6. Nine units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three
of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first.
7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four
of the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the
second.
8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh,
six of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five
of the fifth, two of the third, eight of the first.
Units of different orders are what?
32. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations,
several important principles are derived, which we will now
present.
1st . Figures have two values, Simple and Local.
The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken
alone; thus, 2, 5, 8.
The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with
another figure or figures in the same number; thus, in 843
the simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2 ; but J
the local value of the 8 is 800; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40;
and of the 2 is 2 units.
When a figure occupies units' place, its simple and local values are the same.
2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, ex-
presses tens; in the third place, hundreds; in the fourth
place, thousands; and so on.
3d. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun-
dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place,
make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next
place at the left, we readily see that the Arabic method of
notation is based upon the following
Two General Laws.
I. The value of units of the different orders increases from
right to left, and decreases from left to right, in a tenfold
ratio.
II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases
its local value tenfold; and every removal of a figure one place
to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold.
Thus,
6 is 6 units.
60 is 10 times 6 units.
600 is 10 times 6 tens.
6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds.
60000 is 10 times 6 thousands.
First principle derived? What is the simple value of a figure? LocalT
Second principle? Third 1 First law of Arabic notation? Second t
'
^
4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place
from units of the first order, not upon the value of the
figures at the right of it. Thus, in 425 and 400, the value
of the 4 is the same in both numbers, being 4 units of the
third order, or 4 hundred.
Care should be taken not to mistake the local vahie of a figure for the value of the
whole number. For, although the value of the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two
numbers. 425 and 400, the value of the whole of the first number is greater than that
»f the second.
5th. Every period contains three figures (units, tens, and
hundreds), except the left hand period, which sometimes
contains only one or two figures (units, or units and tens).
33. As all the principles upon which the writing and
reading of whole numbers depend have now been analyzed,
we will present these principles in the form of rules.
Rule for Notation.
I. Beginning at the left hand, write the figures belonging
to the highest period.
II. Write the hundreds, tens, and units of each successive
period in their order, placing a cipher wherever an order
of units is omitted.
Rule for Numeration.
I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each,
tommencing at the right hand.
II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately,
and give the name to each period, except the last, or period
of units.
34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be
well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point then;
off, and over each period write its name; thus,
Trillions, Billions, Millions, Thousands, Units.

36. From the preceding operations we learn that
Addition is the process of uniting several numbers of
the same kind into one equivalent number.
37. The Sum or Amount is the result obtained by the
process of addition.
38. The sign, + , is called plus, which signifies more.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that they are
to be added j thus, 6 + 4, shows that 6 and 4 are to be added.
39. The sign, =, is called the sign of equality. When
placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies
that they are equal to each other; thus, the expression
6 + 4=10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that
the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10.

1. A farmer sold some hay for 102 dollars, six cows for
162 dollars, and a horse for 125 dollars; what did he
receive for all?
Analysis. Arrange the numbers so that
units of like order shall stand in the same
column. Then add the columns separately,
for convenience commencing at the right hand,
and write each result under the column added.
Thus, we have 5 and 2 and 2 are 9, the sum of
the units; 2 and 6 are 8, the sum of the tens;
1 and 1 and 1 are 3, the sum of the hundreds.
Hence, the entire amount is 3 hundreds 8 tens
and 9 units, or 389.

store, 475 dollars for a clerk, and 367 dollars for other
expenses; what is the amount of his expenses?
Analysis. Arranging the num-
bers as in Case I, we first add the
column of units, and find the sum to
be 17 units, which is 1 ten and 7
units. Write the 7 units in the place
of units, and the 1 ten in the place of
tens. The sum of the figures in the
column of tens is 15 tens, which is 1
hundred, and 5 tens. Write the
5 tens in the place of tens, and the
1 hundred in the place of hundreds.
Next add the column of hundreds,
and find the sum to be 14 hundreds,
which is 1 thousand and 4 hundreds. Write the 4 hundreds in the
place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands. Lastly,
by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens and hun-
dreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds 6 tens
7 units, or 1567.
This example may be performed by another method,
which is the common one in practice. Thus:
operation. Analysis. Arranging the numbers as before, we add
725 the first column and find the sum to be 17 units; writ-
A 7K ing the 7 units under the column of units, we add the
1 ten to the column of tens, and find the sum to be 18
**"' tens; writing the 6 tens under the column of tens, we
1567 add the 1 hundred to the column of hundreds, and find
the sum to be 15 hundreds; as this is the last column,
write down its amount, 15; and the whole amount is 1567, as before.
1. Units of the same order are written in the same column; and when the sum
to any column is 10 or more than 10, it produces one or more units of a higher order,
which must be added to the next column. This process is sometimes called "car-
rying the tens."
2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming the numbers
separately; thus, instead of saying 7 and D are 12, and 5 are 17, simply pronource
the results, 7, 12,17, etc.
Give explanation. Second explanation. What is meant by carry-
Qg the tens 1

42. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers to be added so that the units
of the same order shall stand in the same column j that is,
units under units, tens under tens, etc.
II. Commencing at units, add each column separately, and
write the sum underneath, if it be less than ten.
IIL If the sum of any column be ten or more than ten, wrilt
the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column.
IV. Write the entire sum of the last column.
Proof. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column,
and add the figures in each column in an opposite direction
from that in which they were first added; if the two results
agree, the work is supposed to he right. Or,
2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori-
zontal line; find the sum of each set separately; add these
sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained,
the work is presumed to be correct.
By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are united in new combina-
tions, which render it almost impossible for two precisely similar mistakes to
occur.
The first method is the one commonly used in business.

47. The Difference or Remainder is the result ob-
tained by the process of subtraction.
The minnend and subtrahend mnst he like numbers; thus, 5 dollars from 9 dol-

to say 5 apples from 9 dollars, or 5 dollars from 9 apples.
48. The sign, —, is called minus, which signifies less.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one
after it is to be taken from "the one before it. Thus, 8—6
=2 is read 8 minus 6 equals 2, and shows that 6, the sub-
trahend, taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the
remainder.

1. From 574 take 323.
Analysis. Write the less number un-
der the greater, with units under units,
tens under tens, etc., and draw a line
underneath. Then, beginning at the right
hand, subtract separately each figure of
the subtrahend from the figure above it in
the minuend. Thus, 3 from 4 leaves 1, which is the difference of the
units; 2 from 7 leaves 5, the difference of the tens; 3 from 5 leaves 2,
the difference of the hundreds. Hence, we have for the whole differ-
•nce, 2 hundreds 5 tens and 1 unit, or 251.

write in the remainder in units' place. As we have taken 1 ten from
the 4 tens, 3 tens only are left. We cannot take 5 tens from 3 tens;
bo from the 8 hundreds we take 1 hundred, which equals 10 tens, and
add to the 3 tens, making 13 tens; 5 tens from 13 tens leave 8 tens,
which we write in the remainder in tens' place. As we have taken
1 hundred from the 8 hundreds, 7 hundreds only are left; 3 hundreds
from 7 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, which we write in the remainder
in hundreds' place, and we have the whole remainder, 487.
The numbers written over the minuend are used simply to explain more clearly
the method of subtracting; in practice the process should be performed mentally,
and these numbers omitted.
The following method is more in accordance with prac-

operation. Analysts. Since we cannot take 9 units from 8
j^i units, we add 10 units to 6 un'ts, making 16 units;
ogB 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have
oar added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall
l q k n have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we
add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6
4 8 7 tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens; so we
add 10 tens to 4, making 14 tens; 6 tens from 14
tens leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the
minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we
add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun-
dreds; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have
for the total remainder, 487, the same as before.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Second explanation.
The process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called borrowing 10, and
that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend, carrying one.
51. From the preceding illustrations we hare the fol-
lowing
Rule. I. Write the less mimber under the greater, plcn>
ing units of the same order in the same column.
II. Begin at the right hand, and take each figure of flu
mbtrahend from the figure above it, and write the result un*
derneath.
III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than tha
corresponding figure above it, add 10 to that upper figure be-
fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure
of the subtrahend.
Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if
their sum be eaual to the minuend, the work is supposed
to be right.

1. Multiply 374 by 6.
Analysis. In this example it is
required to take 374 six times. If we
take the units of each order 6 times,
we Bhall take the entire number 4
times. Therefore, writing the multi
plier under the unit figure of the mul-
tiplicand, we proceed as follows: 6
times 4 units are 24 units; 6 times 7
tens are 42 tens; 6 times 3 hundreds
are 18 hundreds; and adding these
partial products, we obtain the entire
product, 2244.

2244
Analysis. Writing the numbers as before, begin
at the right hand or unit figure, and say: 6 times 4
units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4 units; write
the 4 units in the product in units' place, and reserve
the 2 tens to add to the next product; 6 times 7 tens
are 42 tens, and the two tens reserved in the last
product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds and 4 tens; write the
4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve the 4 hundreds to add
to the next product; 6 times 3 hundreds are 18 hundreds, and 4 hun.
dreds added are 22 hundreds, which being written in the product in
the places of hundreds and thousands, gives, for the entire product,
2244.
61. The unit value of a number is not changed by re-
peating the number. As the multiplier always expresses
times, the product must have the same unit value as the
multiplicand. But since the product of any two numbers
will be the same, whichever factor is taken as a multiplier,
either factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand.
In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in addition, irithout
naming the numbers separately; thus, in the last example, instead of saying 6 times
4 are 24, 6 times t are 42 and 2 to carry are 44,6 times S are 18 and 4 to carry are 22,
pronounce only the results, 24,44,22, performing the operations mentally. This
Will greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

by multiplying by each figure are called partial products.
2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the multiplier, pass

63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following general
Rule. I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand, plac-

II. Multiply the multiplicand by each figure of the multi-
plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write
the first figure of each partial product under the figure of the
multiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.
III. If there are partial products, add them, and their sum
will be the product required.

SIMPLE NUMBEBS.
CONTKACTIONS.
Case I.
65. "When the multiplier is a composite number.
A Composite Number is one that may be produced by
multiplying together two or more numbers; thus, 18 is a
composite number, since 6 x 3 = 18; or, 9 x 2 = 18; or,
3x3x2 = 18.
66. The Component Faetors of a number are the sev-
eral numbers which, multiplied together, produce the given
number; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2
(10 x 2=20); or, 4 and 5 (4 x 5=20); or, 2 and 2 and 5
(2x2x5=20).
The pupil mast not confound the factor* with the parts of a number. Thus, the
factors of which 12 is composed, are 4 and 3 (4 x 8=13); while the parts of which IS
is composed are 8 and 4 (8+4=12), or 10 and 2 (10+2=12). The factors are multi-
plied, while the parte are added, to produce the number.

Analysis. The fac-
tors of 82 are 4 and
8. If we multiply the
cost of 1 horse by 4,
we obtain the cost of 4
horses; and by multi-
plying the cost of 4
horses by 8, we obtain
5568 cost of 32 horses,
the cost of 8 times 4 horses, or 32 horses, the number bought.
61. Hence we have the following
Rule. I. Separate the composite number into two or more
factors.

Case II.
68. "When the multiplier is 10, 100, 1000, etc.
If we annex a cipher to the multiplicand, each figure is
removed one place toward the left, and consequently the
value of the whole number is increased tenfold (32). If
two ciphers are annexed, each figure is removed two places
toward the left, and the value of the number is increased
one hundred fold; and every additional cipher increases
the value tenfold.
69. Hence the following
Rule. Annex as many ciphers to the multiplicand as there
are ciphers in the multiplier; the number so formed will be
the product required.

one or both of the factors.
1. Multiply 1200 by 60.
OPERATION.
Multiplicand, 1200
Multiplier, 60
Product, 72000
Analysis. Both multiplicand and
multiplier may be resolved into their
component factors; 1200 into 12 and
100, and 60 into 6 and 10. If these
several factors be multiplied together
they will produce the same product
as the given numbers (67). Thus, 12x6=72, and 72x100=7200,
and 7200 x 10=72000, which is the same result as in the operation.
Rule. Multiply the significant figures of the multiplicand
by those of the multiplier, and to the product annex as many
ciphers as there are ciphers on the right of both factors.

then 6 is contained in 2 tens no times, and write a

Case II.
78. When the divisor consists of two or more
figures.
To illustrate more clearly the method of operation, we will first take an example
usually performed by Short Division.
Case II is what?
f
1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528?
operation. Analysis. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou-
8 ) 2528 ( 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and
04 consider how many times 8 is contained in this
partial dividend, 25 hundreds, and find that it
1* is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder.
8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor,
in 8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub
. Q tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par
tial dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains
1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down
the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial
dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain-
der; 8 multiplied by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from
12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units,
and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then, 8 is con-
tained in 48 units 6 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as
before, we find that nothing remains, and the entire quotient is 316.
2. How many times is 23 contained in 4807?
operation. Analysis. We first find how
Divisor. Divid'd. Quotient. many times 23 is contained in 48,
23 ) 4807 ( 209 the first partial dividend, and place
46 the result in the quotient on the
right of the dividend. We then
multiply the divisor, 23, by the
quotient figure, 2, and subtract the
product, 46, from the part of the
dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of
the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend.
Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in th»
quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a
third partial dividend, 207; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times; multiply-
ing and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and the entire quo-
tient is 209.
1. When the process of dividing is performed mentally, and the results only are

207
207
Division-. 53
8. Short Division is generally used when the divisor 1r a number that will allow
the process of dividing to be performed mentally.
From the preceding illustrations we derive the following
general
Rule. I. Write the divisor at the left cf the dividend, as
in short division.
IL Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the
dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and
place the quotient at the right of the dividend, with a line
"between them.
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract
the product from the partial dividend used, and to the re-
mainder bring down the next figure of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend
have been brought down and divided.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure
of the dividend, and divide as before.
VL If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures
of the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the
divisor underneath.
1. If any remainder be equal to, or greater than tho divisor, the quotient figure 1b
too small, and must be increased.
8. If the product of the divisOr by the quotient figure bo greater than the partial
dividend, the quotient figure is too large, and must be diminished.
79. Proof. 1. The same as in short division. Or,
2. Subtract the remainder, if any, from the dividend, and
divide the difference by the quotient; if the result be tha
same a3 the given divisor, the work is correct.

big 1143 by 3, we
have a quotient of 571,
and a remainder of
1 undivided, which,
being a part of the
given dividend, must
also be a part of the
true remainder. The
§71 being a quotient arising from dividing by 2, its units are 2 times
as great in value as the units of the given dividend, 1143. Dividing
the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder of 3 undi-
vided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied by 2 to
change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a true re-
mainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 71 by 4, we
have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This 3 is a part
of the 71, the units of which are 8 times as great in value as those of
the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great in value as thosa
of the given dividend, 1143; therefore, to change this last remainder,
3, to units of the same value as the dividend, we multiply it by 8 and
2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising from dividing by 4.
Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain 55, the true remainder.
Rule. I. Multiply each partial remainder, except the first,
by all the preceding divisors.
II. Add the several products with the first remainder, and
the sum will be the true remainder.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION.
86. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative
values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the
falue of either dividend or divisor must produce a change
in the value of the quotient. But some changes may he
produced upon both dividend and divisor, at the same time,
that will not affect the quotient . The laws which govern
these changes are called General Principles of Division,
which we will now examine.
I. 54 -=- 9 = 6.
Multiplying the dividend by 3, we have
54 x 3 -=- 9 = 162 ~ 9 = 18,
and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence,
Multiplying the dividend by any number, multiplies the quo-
tient by the same number.
II. Using the same example, 54 4- 9 = 6.
Dividing the dividend by 3 we have
4^9 = 18-4-9 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the
dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
III. Multiplying the divisor by 3, we have
54 4- 9 x 3 = 54 -4- 27 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying
the divisor by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
IV. Dividing the divisor by 3, we have
54 4-1 = 54 — 3 = 18,

B the value of the quotient depend? What is the
aciple of division 1 Second? Third? Fourth 1
GENEBAL PRINCIPLES OP DIVISION. 65
and 18 = the quotient, 6, multiplied by 8. Hence, Divid-
ing the divisor by any number, multiplies the quotient by the
same number.
. V. Multiplying both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
54 x 3 -=- 9 x 3 = 162 -i~ 27 = 6.
Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by tlie same
number, does not alter the value of the quotient.
VL Dividing both dividend and divisor by 3, we have i
AA-$ = 18-h3 = 6.
Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
87. These six examples illustrate all the different changes
we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divi-
sor in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which
these changes are based may be stated as follows:
Prin. I. Multiplying the dividend mvltiplies the quotient;
jnd dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (86.1 and II.)
Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient;
and dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (86. Ill
and IV.)
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and
divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86.
V and VI.)
88. These three principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the dividend produces a like change in tht
quotient; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite
change in the quotient.
If a number Ire multiplied and the product divided by the same number, the quo*
tient will be equal to the number multiplied. Thus, 15 x 4=60, and 60-i-4= 15.

condensed? What is the first? Second? Third? In what general
law are these embraced?

EXACT DIVISORS.
89. An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives
a whole number for a quotient.
As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an
exact divisor, we will present a few directions that will bo
of assistance, particularly in finding exact divisors of large
numbers.
A number whose unit figure is 0, 2,4, 6, or 8, is called an Even Number. And a
number whose unit figure is 1,3,5,7, or 9, is called an Odd Number.
2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers.
4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens
and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268,
756, 1284.
5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is
0 or 5. Thus, 5 is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840.
8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun-
dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact
divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560.
9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of
the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the
digits 2+4 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 0=36, and 36-^9=4.
10 is an exact divisor when 0 occupies units' place.
100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens.
1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun-
dreds, etc.
A composite number is an exact divisor of any number,
when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number.
Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of 12; and so also are 4
(=2x2) and 6 (=2x3).
An even number is not an exact divisor of an odd number.
If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number.
What is an exact divisor? What is an even nnmber? An odd num-
ber? When is 2 an exact divisor? 4? 5? 9? 10? 100? 1000 f
When is a composite number an exact divisor? An even number is
not an exact divisor of what? An odd nnmber is an exact divisor oi
what?
FACTORING NUMBERS.

twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even
number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42; so also is 7 x 2,
or 14.

operation. Analysis. Divide the given number by 8,
the least prime factor, and the result by 2; this
gives an odd number for a quotient, divisible by
the prime factor, 3, and the quotient resulting
from this division is also divisible by 3. The
next quotient, 77, we divide by its least prime
factor, 7, and obtain the quotient 11; this being
a prime number, the division can not be carried
further. The divisors and last quotient, 2, 2, 3,
3, 7, and 11 are all the prime factors of the given
number, 2772.
Rule. Divide the given number by any prime factor >
divide the quotient in the same manner, and so continue the
division until the quotient is a prime number. The several
divisors and the last quotient will be the prime factors re-
quired.
Proof. The product of all the prime factors will be the
given number.

CANCELLATION.
93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal fac-
tors from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of
dividend and divisor.
It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the
product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence,
if the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of
which is the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient.
1. Divide 63 by 7.

by writing the num-
bers which constitute the dividend above a line, and those which con-
stitute tho divisor below it. Instead of multiplying 24 by 56, in tho
dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and G, and 56 into the factors
7 and 8; and 48 in the divisor into the factors 6 and 8. We next
cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are common to the dividend and
divisor, and we have left the factor 4 in the dividend, which is the
quotient.
When all the factors or numbers in the dividend are canceled, 1 should be
"retained.
95. If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in
the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that
factor.

in the dividend. Completing the work, we have *f-=ty, Ans.
From the preceding examples and illustrations we derive
the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers composing the dividend above
a horizontal line, and the numbers composing the divisor
below it.
II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and
divisor.
III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the
dividend by the product of the remaining factors of the di-
visor, and the result will be the quotient.
1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number by that factor.
2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take its place.
3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the divisor.
4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the product of the
remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient.
6. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of the dividend on
*.lic right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor on the left.

operation. Analysis. We observe that 3 will
exactly divide each of the given num-
bers, and that 7 will exactly divide
each of the resulting quotients. Hence,
each of the given numbers can be ex-
g x 7 — 21 A ns. actly divided by 3 times 7; and these
numbers must be component factors of
the greatest common divisor. Now, if there were any other component
factor of the greatest common divisor, the quotients, 2, 3, 5, would be
exactly divisible by it. But these quotients are prime to each other.
Hence 3 and 7 are all the component factors of the greatest common
divisor sought.

PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS.
^J 1. What is the greatest common divisor of 84 and 203?
Analysis. Draw two vertical lines, and
place the larger number on the right, and
the smaller number on the left, one line
lower down. Then divide 203, the larger
number, by 84, the smaller, and write 2,
the quotient, between the verticals, the
product, 168, opposite, under the greater
number, and the remainder, 35, below.
Next divide 84 by this remainder, writing
the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the
product, 70, on the left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70.
Again divide the last divisor, 35, by 14", and obtain 2 for a quotient,
J8 for a product, and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the
same order as in the former steps. Finally, divide the last divisor,
14, by the last remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last
divisor, is the greatest common divisor of the given numbers.

Thus we have shown,

"VOL To find the least common multiple.
'First Method.
From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow-
ing principles:
I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all
the prime factors of that number.
II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it
will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers.
III. The least number that will exactly contain all the
prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common
multiple of those numbers.

factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors,
2 x 3 x 13 x 11 x 7 x 5,
and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers; and
hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of the
given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be omitted
without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the product of
the series is the least common multiple of the given numbers, (III.)
From thia example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Resolve the given numbers into their prime
factors.
II. Take all the prime factors of the largest number, and
such prime factors of the other members as are not found in
the largest number, and their product will be the least com-
mon multiple. ^
When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given numbers, it must be used as
many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the greatest number of times it appears
In any of the given numbers.

105. 1. What is the least common multiple of 4, 6, 9,
and 12?
Analysis. First write the
given numbers in a series, with
a vertical line at the left.
Since 2 is a factor of some of
the given numbers, it must be
a factor of the least common
multiple sought. Dividing as
many of the numbers as are
divisible by 2, write the quo-
tients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. "We now
perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain the
factor 2; hence the least common multiple must contain another 2,
and we again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient when
it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a like reason, and still again by 3.
By this process we have transferred all the factors of each of the
numbers to the left of the vertical; and their product, 36, must be the
least common multiple sought, (104, III.)
2. "What is the least common multiple of 10,12,15, and 75?
Analysis. We read-
ily see that 2 and 5 are
among the factors of the
given numbers, and must
be factors of the least
common multiple; hence
we divide every number
that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product; thus, we
divide 10 by both 2 and 5; 12 by 2; 15 by 5; and 75 by 5. We next
divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3; and afterwards the
third line by 5. By this process we collect the factors of the given
numbers into groups; and the product of the factors at the left of the
vertical is the least common multiple sought.

3x7x2x5 = 210, Ans. given numbers; thus, 6 is
contained in 42, and 35 in
70; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35.
Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the remain
ing numbers, 15, 48, and 70.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, omitting any of th«
smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a
vertical line at the left.
II. Divide by any prime factor, or factors, that may be con-
tained in one or more of the given numbers, and write the
quotients and undivided numbers, in a line underneath, omit-
ting the Vs.
III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided
numbers, and continue the process till all the factors of the
given numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical.
Then multiply these factors together, and their product will
be the least common multiple required.

and turkeys at two prices, 75 cents and 90 cents, of which
he imprudently took the cheaper; how much did he thereby
forfeit? Ans. 80 cents.
CLASSIFICATION OP NUMBERS.
Numbers may be classified as follows:
106. I. As Even and Odd.
107. II. As Prime and Composite.
What is the first classification of numbers? What is an even num-
ber? An odd number? Second classification? A prime number?
A composite number?
CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS. 85
108. III. As Integral and Fractional.
An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole
things. Thus, 281; 78 boys; 1000 books.
A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal
parts of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an
hour; seven-eighths of a mile.
109. IV. As Abstract and Concrete.
110. V. As Simple and Compound.
A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a
concrete number of but one denomination. Thus 48, 926;
48 dollars, 926 miles.
A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value
is expressed in two or more different denominations. Thus,
32 dollars 15 cents; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes; 7 miles
82 rods 9 feet 6 inches.
111. VI. As Like and Unlike.
Iiike Numbers are numbers of the same unit value.
If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62,
487; or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples,
62 apples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, they
must be used to express the same kind of quantity, as time,
distance, etc. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6
days 9 hours; 5 miles 40 rods; 2 miles 100 rods.
Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values.
Thus, 75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes,
and 5 bushels 1 peck.

112. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the
parts is called one-half.
If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one-third, two of the parts two-thirds.
If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of the parts
is called one-fourth, two of the parts two-fourths, three of
the parts three-fourths.
If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts
Is called one-fifth, two of the parts two-fifths, three of the
parts three-fifths, etc.
The parts are expressed by figures; thus,

Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided
take their name, and their value, from the number of equal
parts into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide
an orange into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves;
if into 3 equal parts, thirds; if into 4 equal parts, fourths,
etc.; and each third is less in value than each half, and
each fourth less than each third; and the greater the num-
ber of parts, the less their value.
When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts,
one or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole
number, and is called a fraction. Hence,
113. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a
unit.

DEFINITIONS, NOTATION, NUMERATION. 87
114. To write a fraction, two integers are required, one
to express the number of "parts into which the whole num-
ber is divided, and the other to express the number of these
parts taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal
parts, the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts
are called three-fourths of a dollar. This three-fourths may
be written
3 the number of parts taken.
4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided.
115. The Denominator is the number below the line.
It.denominates or names the parts; and
It shows how many parts are equal to a unit.
116. The Numerator is the number above the line.
It numerates or numbers the parts; and
It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by the
fraction.
117. The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and
denominator, taken together.
118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answer-
ing to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor.
119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu-
merator divided by the denominator.
130. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe
its numerator and denominator. Thus, f is analyzed as
follows :—
4 is the denominator, and shows that the integer is divided
into 4 equal parts; it is the divisor.
3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken; it
is the dividend, or integer divided.
3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor.
The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3-i-4, or J.

121. Fractions are distinguished as Proper and Improper.
A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than
its denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus,
rV, tV, tV, $i are proper fractions.
An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals
or exceeds its denominator; its value is never less than the
unit, 1. Thus, f, •§, J^-, ty, |#, -i^ are improper fractions.
122. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in-
teger and a fraction; thus, 4£, 17£$, 9^j are mixed numbers.
123. Since fractions indicate division, all changes in the
terms of a fraction will affect the value of that fraction ac-
cording to the laws of division ; and we have only to modify
the language of the General Principles of Division (87) by

General Principles of Fractions.
124. Prin. I. Multiplying the numerator multiplies the
fraction, and dividing the numerator divides the fraction.
Prin. II. Multiplying the denominator divides the frac
tion, and dividing the denominator multiplies the fraction.
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both terms of the frac-,
tion by the same number does not alter the value of the fraction.
These three principles may be embraced in one

in the value of the fraction; but a change in the denomina-
tor produces an opposite change in the value of the fraction.

ANALYSIS:
As in whole
numbers, we
can Bubtract like numbers only, or those having the same unit value,
bo, we can subtract fractions only when they have a common denom-
inator. As J and £ have not a common denominator, we first reduce
them to a common denominator, and then subtract the less numerator,
30, from the greater, 32, and write the difference, 2, over the common
denominator, 33. We thus obtain fe — ^g, the required difference.
Rule. I. Wlien necessary, reduce the fractions to a com-
mon denominator.

We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by
the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer-
ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a
fraction. Hence, by inverting the terms of the divisor, the two frac-
tions will stand in such relation to each other that we can multiply
together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quotient,
and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in the
operation. For division of fractions, we have this general
Rule. I. Reduce integers and mixed numbers to improper
fractions.
II. Invert the terms of the divisor, and proceed as in mul-

116 DECIMALS.
DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
143. Decimal Fractions are fractions which have for
their denominator 10, 100, 1000, or 1 with any number of
ciphers annexed.
1. The word decimal is derived from the Latin decern, which signifies ten.
2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals.
8. Since ^ = -j^, -j-^ = y^g^, etc., the denominators of decimal fractions in-
crease and decrease in a tenfold ratio, the same as simple numbers.
Decimal Notation and Numeratiok.
144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of
a unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths,
twenty-fourths, etc.
Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit,
thus: A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths;
each of these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts,
called hundredths; each of these hundredths into ten other
equal parts, called thousandth s; and so on. Since the de-
nominators of decimal fractions increase and decrease by the
scale of 10, the same as simple numbers, in writing decimals
the denominators may be omitted.
In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of
notation and numeration; and so also is it in decimals. We
extend the scale of notation to the left of units' place in
writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing
decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens,
and the first place at the right of units is tenths ; the second
place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at the
right is hundredths; the third place at the left in thousands,
and the third place at the right is thousandths; and so on.
What are decimal fractions? How do they differ from common
fractions t How are they written t
The Decimal Point is a period (.), which must always be
placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,
-3% is expressed .6
t"W'' " -54
drto" " -279
The decimal point is also called the Separatrix. This is a correct name for it
only when it stands between the integral and decimal parts of the same number.
.5 is 5 tenths, which = -fo of 5 units;
.05 is 5 hundredths, "= -^ of 5 tenths;
.005 is 5 thousandths, "= ^ of 5 hundredths.
And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place
is ^ the value of the same figure in the next left hand place.
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is
clearly shown by the following
Numeration Table.

Tenths are expressed by one figure.
Hundredths " " "two figures.
Thousandths " " "three"
Ten thousandths" " "four"
And any order of decimals by one figure less than the cor-
responding order of integers.

is the value of a figure in any decimal place?
dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be
expressed by writing the numerator only; but in this case
the numerator or decimal must always contain as many
decimal places as are equal to the "number of ciphers in the
denominator; and the denominator of a decimal will always
be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to
the number of figures in the decimal or numerator.
The decimal point must never be omitted.
Examples for Practice.
1. Express in figures thirty-eight hundredths.
2. Write seven tenths.
3. Write three hundred twenty-five thousandths.
4. Write four hundredths. Ans. .04
5. Write sixteen thousaDdths.
6. Write seventy-four hundred-thousandths. Ans. .00074.
7. Write seven hundred forty-five millionths.
8. Write four thousand two hundred thirty-two ten-thou-
sandths.
9. Write five hundred thousand millionths.
10. Read the following decimals:
.05 .681 .9034 .19248
.24 .024 .0005 .001385
.672 .8471 .100248 .1000087
To read a decimal, first numerate from left to right, and the name of the right
hand figure is the name of the denominator. Then numerate from right to left, aa
in whole numbers, to read the numerator.
146. A Mixed Number is a number consisting of in-
tegers and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral
part, 71, and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as
71iWir, 71 and 406 thousandths.'
Examples for Practice.
1. Write eighteen, and twenty-seven thousandths.
2. Write four hundred, and nineteen ten-millionths.
How many decimal places must there be to express any decimal?
3. Write fifty-four, and fifty-four millionths.
4. Eighty-one, and 1 ten-thousandth.
5. One hundred, and 67 ten-thousandths.
6. Read the following numbers:
18.027 100.0067 400.0000019
81.0001 54.000054 3.03
75.075 9.2806 40.40404
147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations
ire derive the following important
Principles of Decimal Notation and Numeration.
1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon its place
from the decimal point: thus .3 is ten times .03.
2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the
same as dividing it by ten; thus, .03 is -fa the value of . 3.
3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value,
since it does not change the place of the significant figures
of the decimal; thus, ^, or .6, is the same as -ffo, or .60.
4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from
left to right, in a tenfold ratio; and therefore they may be
added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole .
numbers.
5. The denominator of a decimal, though never expressed,
is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there
are figures in the decimal.
6. To read decimals requires two numerations; first, from
nnits, to find the name of the denominator, and second, to-
wards units, to find the value of the numerator.
148. Having analyzed all the principles upon which the
writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now pre-
sent these principles in the form of rules. »

Rule for Decimal Numeratioh.
I. Numerate from the decimal point, to determine the de-
nominator.
II. Numerate towards the decimal point, to determine th
numerator.

operation. Analysis. The given decimals must contain
.50000 »s many places each, as are equal to the greatest
37500 number of decimal figures in any of the given
„ ok jni decimals. We find that the third number con-
tains five decimal places, and hence 100000 must
be a common denominator. As annexing ciphers
to decimals does not alter their value, (144, 3)
we give to each number five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and
thus reduce the given decimals to a common denominator.
Rule. Give to each number the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers.
1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that one of the given nam
bers having the greatest number of decimal places, they will have their least com-

a. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing the decimal
point after units, and annexing ciphers; one cipher reducing It to tenths, two
ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thousandths, and so on.

MULTIPLICATION.
154. 1. What is the product of .35 multiplied by .5?
operation. Analysis. We perform the multiplication the
.35 same as in whole numbers, and the only difficulty
-5 we meet with is in pointing off the decimal places
in the product. To determine how many places to
.HO, Ans. point off, we may reduce the decimals to common
fractions; thus, .35 = ^ and .5 = ^. Perform-
ing the multiplication, we have Wu * A = AtA «""* this product,
expressed decimally, is .175. Here we see that the product contains
as many decimal places as are contained in both multiplicand and

The currency of the United States is decimal currency, and is eomet'mcs called
Federal Honey; it was adopted by Congress in M86.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
BY THE "COINAGE ACT OF 1873."
The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver,
nickel, and bronze.
The Cold Coins are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle,
quarter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces.
The Silver Coins are the dollar, half-dollar, quarter-dol-
lar, the twenty-cent, and ten-cent pieces.
The Nickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces.
The Bronze Coins are the one-cent pieces.
Table.
10 mills (wi.) make 1 cent c.
10 cents "1 dime d.
10 dimes "1 dollar $.
10 dollars "1 eagle E.
1. The mill is a denomination used only in computations; it is not a coin.
t. The trade-dollar Is designed solely for commerce, and not for currency. Itr
weight is 420 grains. The weight of the currency dollar of 1878 is 412$ grains.
3. The character $ is supposed to be a contraction of V. S. (United States), the
U being placed upon the S.

132 DECIMAL CURRENCY.
159. The gold dollar is the unit of United States money;
dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and are
separated from the dollar by the decimal point; thus, two
dollars one dime two cents five mills, are written $2.125.
By examining the table, we see that the dime is a tenth,
part of the unit, or dollar; the cent a tenth part of the dime
or a hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill a tenth part
ft the cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth
part of the dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal
currency increase and decrease the same as decimal fractions,
and are expressed according to the same decimal system of
notation; and they may be added, subtracted, multiplied,
and divided in the same manner as decimals.
Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes
and cents are appropriated to cents; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes
i cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents; hence,
When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a
*ipher before it in the place of dimes.
The half cent is frequently written as B mills; thns, 24j cents, written $.245.
160. Business men frequently write cents as common
fractions of a dollar; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are
written $311$r, and read, three and thirteen hundredths
dollars. In business transactions, when the final result of a
computation contains 5 mills or more, they are called one
cent, and when less than 5, they are rejected.
Examples for Practice.
1. Write four dollars five cents. Ans. $4.05.
2. Write two dollars nine cents.
3. Write ten dollars ten cents.
4. Write eight dollars seven mills. Ans. $8-007.
What is the unit of U. S. currency? What is the general law of

Case V.
172. To find the cost of articles sold by the 100,
or 1000.
1. What cost 475 feet of timber, at $5.24 per 100 feet?

FIRST OPERATION.
$5.24 Analysis. If the price were $5.24 per
475 foot, the cost of 475 feet would be 475 x
oaan $5-24 = $2489. But since $5.24 is the price
oggg of 100 feet, $2489 is 100 times the true
2096 value. Therefore, to obtain the true value,
we divide $2489 by 100, which we may do
100 ) $2489.00 by cutting off two figures from the right,
Ans. $24.89 an<* tte result is $24.89. Or,
Rule. Case V is what? Give first explanation.
IECOXD OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since 1 foot OOSt yfof, or .01,
$5.24 of $5.24, 475 feet will cost fjf, or 4.75 times
4 175 $5.24, which is $24.89.
2620 For the same reasons, when the price is per thou-
occq Band, we divide the product hy 1000, or, which is more
* "'"" convenient in practice, we reduce the given quantity
2096 to thousands and decimals of a thousand, by pointing
. off three figures from the right hand.
$24.8900
Rule. I. Reduce the given quantity to hundreds and deci-
mals of a hundred, or to thousands and decimals of a thousand.
II. Multiply the price by the quantity, and point off in the
result as in multiplication of decimals.
The letter C is used to Indicate hundreds, and H to Indicate thousands.

REDUCTION.
175. A Compound Number is a number whose valnG
is expressed in two or more different denominations.
176. Reduction is the process of changing a number
from one denomination to another without altering its value.
Reduction is of two kinds, Descending and Ascending.
177. Reduction Descending is changing a number of
one denomination to another denomination of less unit
value; thus, $1 = 10 dimes=100 cents=1000 mills.
178. Reduction Ascending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of greater unit value;
thus, 1000 mills=100 cents=10 dimes=$l.
179. A Scale is a series of units, increasing or decreas-
ing, according to a certain law.

Standard of Weight.
188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a
uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of the
custom-houses, and the other branches of business connected
with the general government.
189. Tlie United States standard unit of weight is the
Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial
standard pound of Great Britain, aDd is determined as fol-
lows: A cubic inch of distilled water in a vacuum, weighed
by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62°.
Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of
which the standard Troy pound contains 5760.
190. The U. 8. Avoirdupois pound is determined from
the standard Troy pound, and contains 7000 Troy grains.
Hence, the Troy pound is ^of = iH of an avoirdupois
pound. But the Troy ounce contains ^ff. — 480 grains,
and the avoirdupois ounce if j" = 437.5 grains; and an ounce
Troy is 480—437.5=42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoir-
dupois. The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight,
are the same asthelike denominations in Troy weight, the only
difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ounce.
191. Comparative Table of Weights.
Troy. Apothecaries'. Avoirdupois.
1 pound = 5760 grains, = 5760 grains, = 7000 grains.
1 ounce = 480" =480 *' = 437.5"
175 pounds, = 175 pounds, = 144 pounds.
Examples fok Practice.
1. An apothecary bought 5 lb. 10 oz. of rhubarb, by
avoirdupois weight, at 50 cents an ounce, and retailed it at
12 cents a dram apothecaries' weight; what did he gain?
2. Change 424 drams apothecaries' weight to Troy weight.
3. Change 20 lb. 8 oz. 12 pwt. Troy weight to avoirdu-
pois weight. Ans. 17-g^j lb.
4. Bought by avoirdupois weight 20 lb. of opium, at 40
cents an ounce, and sold the same by Troy weight at 50
cents an ounce ; what did he gain? Ans. $17.83£.
What is the U. S. standard of weight? How obtained? How is
the avoirdupois pound determined? How is the apothecaries' pound
determined? What are the values of the denominations of Troy,
avoirdupois, and apothecaries' weight?

II. Square Mrasure.
195. A Square is a figure bounded by four equal sides,
and having four right angles.
1 square foot is a figure having
four sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as
shown in the diagram. Its contents
ii are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches.
VWW Hence,
The contents or area of a square,
or of any other figure having a uni-
form length and a uniform breadth,
is found by multiplying the length by the breadth. Thus, a
square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the contents
are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long and
10 in. wide is a rectangle, containing 20 x 10 = 200 square
inches.

IIL Cubic Measure.
198. A Cube is a solid, or body,
having six equal square sides, or
faces. If each side of a cube be 1
yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness
of this cube will contain 3x3x1
=9 cubic feet, and the whole cube
will contain 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 cubic
feet
.
A solid, or body, may have the three dimensions all alike
or all different. A body 4 ft. long, 3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick
contains 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 cubic or solid feet. Hence,
The cubic or solid contents of a tody are found by multi-
plying the length, breadth, and thickness together.
199. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used
in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies; as timber,
wood, stone, etc.

Standard of Extension.
202/. TJie U. S. standard unit of measures of extension,
whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or
36 inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of.
Great Britain. It is determined as follows: The rod of a
pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude
of London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided
into 391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36
inches, or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod
is 39.1393 inches long, and the standard yard is -ffHf! of
the length of the pendulum rod.
203. The U. 8. standard unit of liquid measure is the
old English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal
to 8.33888 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at its maxi-
mum density, that is, at the temperature of 39.83° Fahren-
heit, the barometer at 30 inches.

Circular Measure.
207. Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used
principally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geogra-
phy, for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining loca-
tions of places and vessels, and computing difference of time.
Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num-
ber of equal parts, as quarters, called quadrants, twelfths,
called signs, 360ths, called degrees, etc. Consequently the
parts of different circles, although having the same names,
are of different lengths.

216. To reduce a compound number to a decimal
of a higher denomination.
1. Reduce 3 pk. 2 qt. to the decimal of a bushel
operation. Analysis. Since 8 quarts maks
8 2.00 qt. 1 peck, and 4 pecks 1 bushel, there
a o azr\r\ _i will be i as many pecks as quarts
4 3.2500 pk. t-$oa\ ii v li r (18«»), and J as many bushels a3
.8125 bu., Ans. pecks.
Or, 3 pk. 2 qt. = 26 qt. °* we may reduce 3 Pk- 2 I1- to
n K _ qo f i^\e fraction of a bushel (as in 214),
~~~ "' and we have §£ of a bushel, which,
ff = .8125 bu., Ans. recced to a decimal, equals .8125.
Rule. Divide the lowest denomination given by that num-
ber in the scale which will reduce it to the next higher, and
annex the quotient as a decimal to that higher. Proceed in
the same manner until the whole is reduced to the denomina-
tion required. Or,
Reduce the given number to a fraction of the required de-
nomination, and reduce this fraction to a decimal.

8 gr. of gold; at another time, 2 lb. 9 oz. 3 pwt.; at another,
11 oz. 20 gr.; and at another, 25 lb. 16 pwt . 23 gr.; how
much did he sell in all?
Analysis. Arranging the num-
bers in columns, placing units of the
mine denomination under each other,
we first add the units in the right
hand column, or lowest denomina-
tion, and find the amount to be 51
grains, which is equal to 2 pwt.
Ans. 39 1 17 3 3 gr. We write the 3 gr. under the
column of grains, and add the 2 pwt.
So the column of pwt. We find the amount of the second column to
be 37 pwt., which is equal to 1 oz. 17 pwt. Writing the 17 pwt. under
the column of pwt., we add the 1 oz. to the next column. Adding this
column in the same manner as the preceding ones, wo find the amount
to be 25 oz., equal to 2 lb. 1 oz. Placing the 1 oz. under the column
of oz., we add the 2 lb. to the column of lb. Adding the last column,
we find the amount to be 39 lb.

Both methods will obtain the same result; the former is generally
used.
1. When hours are to he obtained, we reckon from 12 at night, and if minutes and
seconds, we write them still at the right of hours.
2. In finding the time between two dates, or in computing interest, 12 months are
considered a year, and 80 days a month.
When the exact number of days is required for any period
not exceeding one ordinary year, it may be readily found by

If the days of the different months are not the same, the
number of days of difference should be added when the
earlier day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and
subtracted when it belongs to the month to which we find
the time. If the 29th of February is to be included in the
time computed, one day must be added to the result.

^T 2 2 7~ vide 102 bu. by 4, and obtain a quotient
of 25 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We
write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the
2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added
makes 11 pk. Dividing 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk.
and a remainder of 3 pk.; writing the 2 pk. under the order of pecks,
we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the dividend, mak-
ing 26 qt., which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt. and a remainder
of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of quarts, and reducing the
remainder, 2 qt., to pints, we have 4 pt., which divided by 4 gives a
quotient of 1 pt., which we write under the order of pints, and the

LONGITUDE AND TIME.
224. Every circle is supposed to be divided into 360
equal parts, called degrees.
Since the sun appears to pass from east to west round the
earth, or through 360°, once in every 24 hours, it will pass
through fa of 360°, or 15° of the distance, in 1 hour; and
1° of distance in ^ of 1 hour, or 4 minutes; and 1' of
distance in ^ of 4 minutes, or 4 seconds.

denominations, gives 1 h. 5 min. 48 sec, the difference in time.
Rule. Multiply the difference of longitude in degrees and
minutes by 4, and the product will be the difference of time in
minutes and seconds, which may be reduced to hours.
If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the difference of longitude
is found by adding them, and if the sum be greater than 180°, it must be subtracted
from 360°.
Examples for Practice.

6. If a message be sent by telegraph without any loss of
J time, at 12 M. from London, 0° 0' longitude, to Washington,
\77° 1' west, what is the time of its receipt at Washington?
Since the snn appears to move from east to west, when it is exactly 12 o'clock at
one place, it will be past 12 o'clock at all places east, and before 12 at all places west.
Hence, knowing the difference of time between two places, and the exact time at
one of them, the exact time at the other will be found by adding their difference to
the given time, if it bu east, and by subtracting if it be west.

DUODECIMALS.
227. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of
a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as, -fa, -^fa,
tJzs, etc. In practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas-
urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit.
If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are
called inches, or primes; the inches divided by 12 give sec-
onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds
divided by 12 give fourths; and so on.
From these divisions of a foot it follows that
1' (Inch or Prime) is -fa of a foot.
1" (Second) or ^ of ^ "-fa of a foot.
1'" (Third) or ^ of .& of &.. « ^fa of a foot.

^" i Duodecimals are really common fractions, and can always bo treated as such; but
usually their denominators are not expressed, and they are treated as compound
numbers.
Addition and Subtraction of Duodecimals.
228. We add and subtract duodecimals the same as other
compound numbers.

sawed off; what was the length of the piece left?
Ans. 11 ft . 10' 7".
Multiplication of Duodecimals.
229. Length multiplied by breadth gives surface, and
surface multiplied by thickness gives solid contents (198).
1. How many square feet in a board 11 feet 8 inches long
and 2 feet 7 inches wide?
Analysis. We first multiply by the T.
7 twelfths times 8 twelfths equals 56 one
hundred forty-fourths, which equals 4
twelfths and 8 one hundred forty-fourths.
We write the 8 144ths — marked with two
indices—to the right, and add the 4 12tha
10 ft 1' 8" to t^e next product. 7' times 11 equals
77', which added to 4' equals 81', equal to
6 feet and 9'. We write the 9' under the
:nches, or 13ths, and the 6 under the feet, or unite. 2 times 8'
equals 16', or 1 foot and 4'. We write the 4' under the &, and
add the 1 foot to the next product. 2 times 11 feet are 22 feet, and
1 foot added make 23 feet, which we write under the 6 feet. Adding

It will be seen from the above that the number of indices to every
product of any two factors is equal to the sum of the indices of those
factors; thus: 7x8'=56"; 4" x5"'=20""'.

the multiplier, beginning with the lowest term in each, and
call the product of any two denominations the denomination
denoted by the sum of their indices, carrying 1 for every 12.

Division of Duodecimals.
230- 1. A flagstone, 3 ft. 9' wide, has a surface of 20 ft.
11' 3"; what is its length?
operation. Analysis. We divide
3 ft. 9' ) 20 ft. 11' 3" ( 5 ft. 7'. the surface by the width
.jo qi to obtain the length. The
divisor is something more
2 2' 3' than 3 ft., and to obtain
2 2 3 the first quotient figure, we
consider how many times
3 ft. and something more is contained in nearly 21 ft. (20 ft. 11'); we
estimate it to be 5 times, and multiplying the divisor by this quotient
figure, we have 18 ft. 9', which, subtracted from 20 ft. 11', leaves
2 ft. 2', to which we bring down 3", the last term of the dividend. We
next seek how many times the divisor is contained in this remainder,
and find by trial the quotient 7'; multiplying the divisor by this figure,
we obtain 2 ft. 2' 3", and there is no remainder.
Rule. I. Write the divisor on the left hand of the dividend,
as in simple numbers.
II. Find the first term of the quotient either by dividing
the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor,
or by dividing the first two terms of the dividend by the first
two terms of the divisor; multiply the divisor by this term
of the quotient, subtract the product from the corresponding
terms of the dividend, and to the remainder bring down an-
other term of the dividend.
III. Proceed in like manner till there is no remainder, or
till a quotient has been obtained sufficiently exact.

PERCENTAGE. 205
PEECENTAGE.
231. Per cent, is a term derived from the Latin words
per centum, and signifies by the hundred, or hundredths,
that is, a certain number of parts of each one hundred parts,
of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5 per cent. is meant 5
cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every
100 bushels, etc. Therefore, 5 per cent. equals 5 hundredths
=.05=T{hf=^r. 8 per cent. equals 8 hundredths=.0.8=
Trir=Tir-
232. Percentage is such a part of a number as is indi-
cated by the per cent.
233. The Base of percentage is the number on which
the percentage is computed.
234. Since per cent. is any number of hundredths, it is
usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be
expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in
the following

1. A merchant sends his agent $1260 with which to buy
merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent.;
what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission?
OPEEATION.
$1260 -^ 1.05 = $1200, invested.
$1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
Or, m + T*T = U; $1260 -J- If = $1200, invested;
And $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
i II id what V Givo explanation. Rule.

Analysis. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must
receive $1.05 for every SI he expends; he can invest as many dollars
as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and the differ-
ence between the given sum and the sum invested is his commission.
Or, the money expended is |gg of itself, the commission is Tg« of
this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is fgj of
the whole sum. Since $1260 is fl}J s fj, $1260 -*- f J = $1200, tha
sum expended; and $1260 — $1200 = $60 the commission.
Rule. I. Divide the given amount by 1 increased by tht
rate per cent. of commission, and the quotient is the sum
invested.
II. Subtract the investment from the given amount, and
the remainder is the commission.

will bring per share in money.
256. A Dividend is a sum paid to stockholders from
the profits of the business of the company.
257. An Assessment is a sum required of stockholders
to meet the losses or expenses of the business of the company.
258. Premium or advance, and discount on stock, divt\

260. The calculations in stock-jobbing are based upon
the following relations:
L Premium, discount, and brokerage are each a percent-
age, computed upon the par value of the stock as the base.
II. The market value of stock, or the proceeds of a sale,
is the amount or difference, according as the sum is greater

\In all examples relating to stocks, $100 will be considered a share, unless other-/
wise stated.
Case I.
261. To find the value of stock, when at an ad-
vance, or discount.
1. What will $3240 of Bank Stock cost at 8 per cent . ad-
vance, brokerage £ per cent.?
operation. Analysis. To find the
$1 -f .08 = $1.08. price of stock, we add the
$1.08 -f .0025 = $1.0825. "*te of advance to, or sub.
$1.0825 x 3240 = $3507.30 tract the discount from, $1;
to this result add the bro-
kerage, and we have the cost of $1. Hence $3240 stock will cost 3240
times $1.0825.
Rule. Multiply the cost of $1 by the number indicating
the par value of the stock.

Stock Investments.
263. The net earnings of a corporation are usually divid-
ed among the stockholders, in semi-annual dividends. The
income of capital stock is therefore fluctuating, being depend-
ent upon the condition of business; while the income arising
from bonds, whether of government or corporations, is fixed,
being a certain rate per cent., annually, of the par value, or
face of the bonds.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Explain difference between
income of capital stock, and of bonds.
264. Federal or United States Securities* are of two
kinds; viz., Bonds and Notes.
Bonds are of two kinds.
First, Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are
known and quoted in commercial transactions by the rate
of interest they bear, thus: U. S. 3's, that is, United State,?
Bonds bearing 3% interest.
Second, Those which are payable at a fixed date, but
Which may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Gov-
ernment may elect. These are known and quoted in com-
mercial transactions by a combination of the two dates,
thus: U. S. 5-20's; or a combination of the rate of inter-
est and the two dates, thus : U. S. 6's 5-20; that is, bonds
bearing 6$ interest, which are payable in twenty years, but
may be paid in five years, if the Government so elect.
When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish
from each other different issues which bear the same rate of
interest, this is done by adding the year in which they be-
come due, thus: U. S. 5's of '71; U. S. 5's of '74; U. S. 4's
of 1907, eta
17. S. Notes are payable on demand, without interest, and
are known as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in
common language, "Greenbacks."
The nomenclature here explained is that used in com-
mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of
States or Corporations.
The interest on all U. S. bonds, except the Pacific B. B.
6's, is payable in gold.
* Though many of the earlier classes of U. S. securities have been
refunded, a full statement of this subject is considered essential to an
understanding of the history of tbose securities which at present rep-
resent our public debt.
What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the dif-
ferent kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on each
payable?
The following are the principal United States Securities
which have been issued since 1860:

1. The 5 20's were issued in 1862, '64, '65, '67, and '70. They bore
interest at 6^, payable semi-annually or quarterly in gold.
2. Bonds issued by States, cities, etc., are quoted in a similar man*
ner. Thus, 8. 0. 6's are bonds bearing 6% interest, issued by the
State of South Carolina.
3. Most of the above named 0. S. bonds have been refunded in the
issues which bear 4J, 4, and Z% interest, but there are several millions
of the earlier issues still outstanding, though the Government hag
ceased to pay interest on them.

TRADE DISCOUNT.
269. A Discount is a deduction from the face of bills,
the list price of goods, or from the amount of debt, without
regard to time, and is usually expressed by the term "per
cent, off."
Thus a discount of 25% means a deduction of 25% off from the ask-
ing price. A discount of 30% and 10% does not mean 40% off, but that
30% is first to be deducted, leaving 70% of the price, then 10% of 70%
of the price, equal to 7%, is deducted from the remainder, leaving 63%;
so that the total discount is but 37%. 3 tens and 5% off means three
successive discounts of 10% and 5% from the remainder, etc.
270. In some kinds of business fixed price lists are
printed, of certain kinds of goods, and when a rise or fall
in prices occurs, instead of changing the prices, the rate of
discount is changed. '".
271. The List Price is called the fixed price, and the
discount is Called Trade Discount. The Net Price
is the list price, less the discount, or the price received for
the goods.

40 cents a pound; what per cent. was gained?
Case II is what? Give explanation. Bnle.
OPERATION.
40 — 32 = 8; 8 -F 32 = & = .25, Ans.
Or, 40 — 32 = 8; 8 ~ 32 = •& = \; \ x 100 = 25%.
Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 = 8 cents, the
whole gain is ^j = \ of the purchase money; and \ reduced to a
decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were
equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent.; but since the
gain is ^j = \ of the purchase money, it will be J of 100 per cent
equal to 25 per cent.
'Eule. Make the difference between the purchase and selling
prices the numerator, and the purchase price the denomina-
tor; reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent.
Or, Take such apart of 100 as the gain or loss is part of
the purchase price.

Case IV.
276. To find the cost, when the selling price and
the gain or loss per cent, are given.
1. A merchant sold cloth for $4.80 a yard, and by so doing
made 33£ per cent.; how much did it cost?
OPERATION.
1 + .33£ = 1.33£; $4.80 -i-1.33£ = $3.60, Ai*
Or, $4.80 = $ of the cost; $4.80 -4- $ = $3.60.
Case IV ia what?

Analysis. Since the gain is 33J per cent- of the cost, $1 of the
cost, increased by 33J per cent., will be what $1 of cost sold for;
therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33J is contained
times in $4.80, or $3.60. Or, since he gained 33$ per cent. = J of the
cost, $480 is J of the cost; $4.80 •*- -J = $3.60.
If the rate per cent, be loss, subtract it from 1, instead of adding it.
Rule. Divide the selling price by 1 increased by the gain
or diminished by the loss per cent., expressed decimally, or in
the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the
cost.

INSURANCE.
277. Insurance on property is security guaranteed by
one party to another, for a stipulated sum, against the loss
of that property by fire, navigation, or any other casualty.
278. The Insurer or Underwriter is the party taking
-,he risk.
279. The Insured is the party protected.
280. The Policy is the written contract between the
parties.
281. The Premium is the sum paid by the insured to
the insurer, and is estimated at a certain rate per cent. of
the amount insured, which rate varies according to the
degree of hazard, or class of risk.
As a security against fraud, most insurance companies take risks at not more
than two-thirds the full valno of the property insured.

TAXES.
283. A Tax is a sum of money assessed on the person
cr property of an individual, for public purposes.
284. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned
at a certain per cent, on the estimated value.
When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally
among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called
a poll tax. Each person so assessed is called a poll.

285. Property is of two kinds—real estate, and per-
sonal property.
286. Real Estate consists of immovable property, such
as lands, houses, etc.
287. Personal Property consists of movable property,
such as money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, etc.
288. An Inventory is a written list of articles of prop-
erty, with their value.
289. Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of
all the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied
must he made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then
a complete list of taxable polls must also be made out.
I. A tax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town;
the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the
assessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be
assessed 75 cents each; what will be the tax on a dollar, and
how much will be A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750,
and who pays for 3 polls?
OPERATION.
$.75 x 220 = $165, amount assessed on the polls.
$3105 — $185 = $3000, amount to be assessed on the property.
$3000 -r- $600,000 = .005, tax on $1.
$3750 x .005 = $18.75, A's tax on property.
$.75 x 3 = $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls.
$18.75 + $2.25 = $21, amount of A's tax.
Rule. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and sub-
tract this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed.
II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by the whole
amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per
cent., or the tax on one dollar.
III. Multiply each man's taxable property by the per cent.,
or the tax on $1, and to the product add his poll tax, if any;
the result will be the whole amount of his tax.

of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry.
294. Revenue is tho income to government from duties
and tonnage.
Duties are of two kinds—ad valorem and specific.
295. Ad "Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost
of goods in the country from which they were imported.
296. Specific Duty is a sum computed on the weight
or measure of goods, without regard to their cost.
297. An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing
the quantity and price of each kind
298. By the New Tariff Act, approved March 2, 1857,
all duties taken at the IT. S. custom-houses, are ad valorem.
In collecting customs, it is the design of government to
tax only so much of tho merchandise as will be available to
the importer in the market. The goods are weighed, meas-
ured, gauged, or inspected, in order to ascertain the actual
quantity and value received in port; and an allowance is
made in every case of waste, loss, or damage.
299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package
or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by
actually weighing one or more of tho empty boxes, casks,
or coverings. In common articles of importation, it is
sometimes computed at a certain per cent. previously ascer-
tained by frequent trials.
300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
casks or barrels.
301. Breakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
bottles.
Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed or legal rate.
302. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of
the goods before any allowance has been made.

LI. To find the interest on any stun, at any rate
years and months.

In percentage, any per cent. of any given number is so
many hundredths of that number; but in interest, any rate
per cent, is confined to 1 year, and the per cent, to be ob-
tained of any given number is greater than the rate per cent.
per annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the
rate per cent. per annum if the time be less than 1 year.
Thus, the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., for 3
yaars 6 months, is 3^ times the interest on the same sum
for 1 year; and the interest for 3 months is J of the interest
for 1 year.

312. To find the interest on any sum., for any-
time, at any rate per cent.
The analysis of our rule is based upon the following
Obviovs Relations between Time and Interest.
L The interest on any sum, for 1 year, at 1 per cent., is
01 of that sum, and is equal to the principal with the
separatrix removed two places to the left.
II. A month being ^ of a year, ^ of the interest on any
sum for 1 year is the interest for 1 month.
What is Case II t Give the first relation between time and interest
Second.
III. The interest on any sum for 3 days is -^ = -^ = .1
of the interest for 1 month, and any number of days may
readily be reduced to tenths of a month by dividing by 3.
IV. The interest on any sum, for 1 month, multiplied by
any given time expressed in months and tenths of a month,
will produce the required interest.
1. What is the interest on $724.68 for 2 yr. 5 mo. 19 da.,

'. left, and have $7.2468, the
f.ouo J interest on the given sum for
29.6-J; 1 year at 1 per cent. (313,
L). Dividing this by 12, we
have $.0039, the interest for
1 month, at 1 per cent.

12078 tient by 29.6J, the time ex-
$17 80557 pressed in months and deci-
„ mals of a month, (III., IV.,)
we have $17.89557, the in
$125.26899, AtlS. terest on the given sum for
the given time, at 1 per cent.
(IV.). And multiplying this product by 7 (7 times 1 per cent.), wo
have $125-268, the interest on the given principal, for the given time,
at the given rate per cent.
Rule. I. Remove the separatrix in the given principal
two places to the left; the result will be the interest for 1
year, at 1 per cent.
II. Divide this interest by 12; the result will be the interest
for 1 month, at 1 per cent.
III. Multiply this interest by the given time expressed in
months and tenths of a month; the result will be the interest
for the given time, at 1 per cent.
IV. Multiply this interest by the given rate; the product
will be the interest required.
Give the third. Fourth. Give analysis. Rule.
Contractions. After removing the separatrix in the principal, two
places to the left, the result may be regarded either as the interest on
the given principal for 12 months at 1 per cent., or for 1 month at 12
per cent. If we regard it as for 1 month at 12 per cent., and if the
given rate be an aliquot part of 12 per cent., the interest on the given
principal for 1 month may readily be found by taking such an aliquot
part of the interest for 1 month as the given rate is part of 12 per
cent. Thus,
To find the interest for 1 month at 6 per cent., remove the separe
trii two places to the left, and divide by 2.
To find it at 3 per cent., proceed as before, and divide by 4; at 4 pei
cent., divide by 3; at 2 per cent., divide by 6, etc.
Sir Per Cent. Method.
313. By referring to 309 it will be seen that the legal
rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient
reason for introducing the following brief method into this
work:
Analysts. At 6 per cent- per annum the interest on (1
For 12 months is $.06.
"2 months (^ = J of 12 mo.) ".01.
"1 month, or 30 days (^ of 12 mo.).." .004*= $.005 (f, of $.06).
"6 days (J of 30 days) ".001.
"1 " (J of 6 da. = & of 30 days).." .000£.
Hence we conclude that,
1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for
every 2 months;
2d. The interest on $1 is $.000| per day, or $.001 for
every 6 days.
From these principles we deduce the
Rule. I. To find the rate :—Call every year $.06, every
2 months $.01, every 6 days $.001, and every less number of
days sixths of 1 mill.
IL To find the interest:—Multiply the principal by the
rate.
1. To find the interest at any other rate per cent, by this method, first find it at
( per cent., and then increase or diminish the result by as many times itself as the
What contractions are given? Give analysis of the 6 per cent,
method. Rule. Its application to any other rate per cent.
given rate is greater or less than 6 per cent. Thus, for 7 per cent, add J, for 4 per
cent- subtract J, etc.
S. The interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for 60 days, is $.01. Therefore, if the
principal be less than $10 and the time less than 6 days, or the principal less than
$1 and the time less than 60 days, the interest will be less than $.01, and may be
disregarded.
3. Since the interest of $1 for 60 days, is $.01, the interest of $1 for any number
of days Is as many centB as 60 is contained times in the number of days. Therefore,
if any principal be multiplied by the number of days in any given number of months
and days, and the product divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents.
That is, Multiply the principal by the number of days, divide the product by 60, and
point off tivo decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in tht
same denomination as the principal.

COMPOUND INTEREST.
324. Compound Interest is interest on both principal
^and interest, when the interest is not paid when due.
L The simple interest may be added to the principal annually, semi-annually, or
quarterly, as the parties may agree; but the taking of compound interest is not
legal.

325. Discount is an abatement or allowance made foi
the payment of a debt before it is due.
326. The Present Worth of a debt, payable at a futuie
time without interest, is such a sum as, being put at legal in-
terest, will amount to the given debt when it becomes due.

in accordance with the following custom: the borrower pre-
sents a note, either made or indorsed by himself, payable at
a specified time, and receives for it a sum equal to the face,
less the interest for the time the note hUs to run. The
amount thus withheld by the bank is in consideration of

EXCHANGE.
338. Exchange is a method of remitting money from
one place to another, or of making payments by written
orders.
339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or order
upon one person to pay a certain sum to another person, or
to his order, at a specified time.
340. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring payment to
be made "at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta-
tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time
specified is usually a certain number of days "after sight."
There are always three parties, and usually four, to a
transaction in exchange.
341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs
the order or bill.
Give the rule. Define exchange. A bill of exchange, A eight
draft. The drawer.
EXCHANGE. 2C7
342. The Drawee is the person to whom the order is
addressed.
343. The Payee is the person to whom the money is
ordered to be paid.
344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who pur-
chases the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill
may be drawn in favor of any other person.
345. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its
back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers
the payment to another. The payee may indorse in Manic
by writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to
the bearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note;
or he may accompany his signature by a special order to pay
to another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in
like manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for
the amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make pay-
ment. A bill made payable to the bearer is transferable
without indorsement.
346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the
drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at
maturity; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writ-
ing the word "Accepted," with his signature, across the
face of the bill.
Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of a hill of exchange
after the time specified has expired. But In New York State no grace is allowed on
eight drafts.
From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in
monetary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes
to make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other per-
son residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie,
which is attended with expense and risk, or sending bank
notes, which are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from
the banks that issue them, he remits a bill of exchange,
purchased at a bank or elsewhere, and made payable to tha

acceptance. What of grace on bills of exchange?
proper person in or near the place where he resides. Thus
a man by paying Boston funds in Boston, may put New
York funds into the hands of his New York agent.
347. The Course of Exchange is the variation of the
cost of sight bills from their par value, as affected by the rela-
tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two
places between which exchange is made. It may be either at
a premium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent- on
the face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight
are subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of
credit given. Hence their value in the money market is
affected by both the course of exchange and the discount
for time.
348. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made
between different countries.
349. Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit-
tances made between different places in the same country.
An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft.
In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange.

6. A Philadelphia manufacturer is informed by his agent
in Buffalo that $3600 is due him on the sale of some prop-
erty. He instructs the agent to remit by a draft payable in
60 days after sight, exchange being at f per cent. premium.
The agent, by mistake, remits a sight draft, which, when
received in Philadelphia, is accepted, and paid after the ex-
piration of the three days of grace. If the manufacturer
immediately puts this money at interest at the legal rate,
will he gain or lose by the blunder of his agent?
Ans. He will lose $1.90.
EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
352. Equation of Payments is the process of finding
the mean or equitable, time of payment of several sums, due
at different times without interest

354. The Average Term of Credit is the time to elapse
before several debts, due at different times, may all be paid
at once, without loss to debtor or creditor.
355. The Equated Time is the date at which the sev-
eral debts may be canceled by one payment.
Case I.
, 356. "When all the terms of credit begin at the
same date.
1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr.
Smith 8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be
paid in 2 months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months;
at what time may I pay the whole amount?

12 x 10 = 120

Jan. 1+6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment.
Anai/TSIS. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30;
and we are to find how long it shall be withheld, or what- WifTU of
credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various terms of credit
on the different items. Now the value of credit on any sum is meas-
ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit
on $8 for 5 mo. = the credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 x 5 = 40 x 1.
In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo. = the credit
on $30 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for 10 mo. = the credit on $120
for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the several terms of credit
en their respective sums equals a credit of 1 month on $180; and thfc
equals a credit of 6 months on $30, because
30 x 6 = 180 x 1.
Rule. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit
and divide the sum of the products by the sum of the pay-
merits; tJie quotient will be the average term of credit.

AVERAGING CREDITS, 273
II. Add the average term of credit to the date at which all
the credits begin, and the result will be the equated time of
payment.
1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of the same denomination,
and the quotient will be of the same denomination as the terms of credit; if these
be months, and there be a remainder after the division, continue the division to
days by reduction, always taking the nearest unit in the last result.
2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the principle of bank
discount; for they imply that the discount of a sum paid before it is due equals the
i •tereat of the same amount paid after it is due.
Examples for Practice.

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
359. The Items of an account may be sums due at the
date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time.
An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the
former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have
dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop-
erty; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name; the
Dr. side of the account shows what B has received from A,
the Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A.
360. The Balance of account is the difference of the
two sides, and may be in favor of either party.
If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from
the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the
account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class.
Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term of credit, and notes
after they become due.

Define items. Balance. To average an account A focal date.
Analysis. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the
items are due June 1, Oct. 12, and Aug. 16, as shown in the two opera-
tions. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1, as a focal
date, and find the difference in days between this date and each of the
others, regard being had to the number of days in calendar months.
From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da.; from June 1 to Aug. 16 is 76 da.
Hence the first item has no credit from June 1, the second item has
133 days' credit from June 1, and the third item has 76 days' credit
from June 1, as appears in the column marked da. After this we pro-
ceed precisely as in Case I, and find the average credit, 71 da., and
the equated time, Aug. 11. v
In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 12, is taken for a focal
date; the work is explained thus: Suppose the account to be settled
Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days, and must
therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on $450 for 133
days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second item draws no
interest, because it falls due Oct. 12. The third item must draw inter-
est 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days — the interest on $14250
for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products, we find the whole amount
of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12, equals the interest on $74100
for 1 day; and this, by division, is found to be equal to the interest on
$1200 for 62 days, which time is the average term of interest. Hence
the account would be settled Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on
the same for 63 days. This shows that $1200 has been due 62 days;
that is, it falls due Aug. 11, without interest.
Rule. I. Find the time at which each item becomes due,
by adding to the date of each transaction the term of credit,
if any be specified, and write these dates in a column.
II. Assume either the earliest or the latest date for a focal
date, and find the difference in days between the focal date
and each of the other dates, and icrite the results in a second
column.
III. Write the items of the account in a third column, and
multiply each sum by the corresponding number of days in the
preceding column, writing the "products in a final column.
IV. Divide the sum of the products by the sum of the items.
The quotient tvill be the average term of credit when the

when the latest date is the focal date; in either case always
reckon from the focal date toward the other dates, to find the

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
Analysis. In the above operation we have written the date»«,
showing when the items become due on either side of the account,
adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The latest
date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and the two
columns marked da. show the difference in days between each date
and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the last case, and
a balance is struck between the items charged and the products.
These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David Ware, on the.
day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes $600 with interest on $35450 for
1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal to the interest
on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore, has been due 59
days. Reckoning back from Oct. 20, we find the date when the bal-
ance fell due, Aug. 22.
Rule. I. Find the time when each item of the account is
due; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the
account to which they respectively belong.
II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the
focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last
case.
III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of
the account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which
must be reckoned from the focal date toward the other dates
when both balances are on the same side of the account, but
from the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides
of the account.

RATIO.
364. Ratio is the comparison with each other of two
numbers of the same kind. It is of two kinds—arithmetical
and geometrical.
365. Arithmetical Ratio is the difference of the two
numbers.
366. Geometrical Ratio is the quotient of one num-
ber divided by the other.
367. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo-
metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from
dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8
is 2, of 10 to 5 is £, etc.
368. Ratio is indicated in two ways.
1st. By placing two points between the numbers com-
pared, writing the divisor before and the dividend after the
points. Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio
of 9 to 4 is written 9 : 4
.
2d. In the form of a fraction; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3
is |; the ratio of 4 to 6 is $.
369. The Terms are the two numbers compared.
370. The Antecedent is the first term.
371. The Consequent is the second term.
372. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex-
plained but by instituting another comparison; thus, the
It is thought heat to omit the questions at the bottom of the pages in the remain.
ing part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such as may be deemed appropriate
f
comparison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed
by 2, nor of 8 to 4 by £. If the question were asked, what
relation 4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect to magnitude, the
answer 2, or \, would not be complete nor correct. But if
we make unity the standard of comparison, and use it as
one of the terms in illustrating the relation of the two
numbers, and say that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the
same as 1 to 2, or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to -J-,
unity in both cases being the standard of comparison, then
the whole meaning is conveyed.
373. A Direct Ratio arises from dividing the conse-
quent by the antecedent.
314. An Inverse or Reciprocal Ratio is obtained by
dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus, the direct
ratio of 5 to 15 is -^ = 3; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15
is A = i-
375. A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as
8 : 12.
376. A Compound Ratio is the product of two or more
simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the
simple ratios of 3:6 and 8 : 2 is f x f = 3 x8:6x2 =
« = £.
377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must
be of the same kind, and of the same denomination.
378. The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing
the second by the first; or by reducing them to a common
denominator, when they are to each other as their numera-
tors. Thus, the ratio of -fV : f is f -=- ^ = fj = 2, which is
the same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator
6 of the equivalent fractions -fa and fa.
Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi-
dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by
the general principles of division, (87.) We have only to
substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for
divisor, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become
RATIO. 281
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO.
Prin. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio;
dividing the consequent divides the ratio.
Prin. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio;
dividing the antecedent multiplies the ratio.
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and
consequent by the same number does not alter the ratio.
These *hree principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the consequent produces a like change in
the ratio; but a change in the antecedent produces an
opiosite change in the ratio.
379. Since the ratio of two numbers is eqnal to the con-
sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that
1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by
the ratio; and that,
2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied
by the ratio.

PROPORTION.
380. Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, the
ratios 6 : 4 and 12 :8, each being equal to f, form a proportion.
381. Proportion is indicated in two ways:
1st. By a double colon placed between the two ratios;
thus, 2 :5 :: 4: 10.
2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios;
!hus, 2 :5 = 4: 10.
382. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro-
portion must consist of at least four terms.
383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms.
384. The Means are the second and third terms.
385. Three numbers may be in proportion when the first
is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, tho
numbers 3, 9, and 27 are in proportion since 3 :9 :: 9 : 27,
the ratio of each couplet being 3. .
In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean
proportional between the other two.
386. In every proportion the product of the extremes is
equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion
3:5:: 6 : 10 we have 3 x 10 = 5 x 6.
SIMPLE PBOPORTION. 283
387. Four numbers that are proportional in the direct
order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation,
or by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2:3::
6 : 9, by inversion becomes 3 : 2 :: 9 : 6, and by alterna-
tion 2 : 6 :: 3 : 9.
388. From the preceding principles and illustrations, it
follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given,
the fourth may readily be found by the following
Kule. I. Divide the product of the extremes by one of the
means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or,
II. Divide the product of the means by one of the extremes,
and the quotient will be the other extreme.

SIMPLE PROPORTION.
389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simple,
ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being
given, the fourth may readily be found.
390. Every question in simple proportion involves the
principle of cause and effect.
391. Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever
kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, dis-
tance, weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, etc.
2. 42 : 70:
3. ( ) : 30
4. 1 : ( )
392. Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom-
plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or con-
sumed, money paid, etc.
393. Causes and effects are of two kinds—simple and
compound.
394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one ele-
ment; as goods purchased or sold, and the money paid oi
received for them.
395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product ot
two or more elements; as men at work taken in connection
with time, and the result produced by them taken in con-
nection with dimensions, length and breadth, etc.
396. Causes and effects that admit of computation, that
is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num-
bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the
things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso-
phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are
always in proportion to their causes, we have the following
proportions:
1st Cause : 2d Cause :: 1st Effect : 2d Effect.
Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect :: 1st Cause : 2d Cause;
in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup-
let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination.
Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract
numbers, we may say that
1st Cause : 1st Effect :: 2d Cause : 2d Effect;
which will produce the same numerical result.
But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers oi
things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded
as the most natural and philosophical.
397. Simple causes and simple effects give rise to simple
ratios ; compound causes and compound effects to compound
ratios.

must have the same
ratio to 3 tone, as $30,
the cost of 5 tons, to

Since the product
of the extremes is equal to the product of the means (373), and the
product of the means divided by one of the extremes will give the
other; (blank) dollars will be equal to the product of 3 x 30 divided by
5, which is $18.

Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the
causes shall compose one couplet, and the effects the other, put-
ting ( ) in the place of the required term.
II. If the required term be an extreme, divide the product
of the means by the given extreme; if the required term be a
mean, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.
1. If the terras of any couplet be of different denominations, they must be reduced
to the same unit value.
2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its lowest unit.
3. If the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common to both, they
should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion contain mixed numbers,
they should first be changed to improper fractions, or the fractional part to a decimal
4. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term are written on
the left, and the terms of the dividend on the right
399. We will now give another method of solving ques-
tions in simple proportion, without making the statement,
and which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one
already given. We will term it the
Second Method.
Every question which properly belongs to simple propor-
tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which
must be given (389). Of the three given numbers, one
must always be of the same denomination as the required
number. The remaining two will be like numbers, and
bear the same relation to each other that the third does to
the required number; in other words, the ratio of the third
to the required number will be the same as the ratio of the
other two numbers.
Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the
second couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or re-
quired term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (379).
By comparing the two like numbers, in any given ques-
tion, with the third, we may readily determine whether the
answer, or required term, will be greater or less than the
third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater than
1, and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form
of an improper fraction as a multiplier; if the answer, or
required term, is to be less than the third term, then the
ratio will be less than 1, and the two like numbers may be
arranged in the form of a proper fraction, as a multiplier.
1. If 4 cords of wood cost $12, what will 20.cords cost?
operation. Analysis. It will
it3 x 20 . be readily seen in this
12 x V. written — j = $60. example, that 4 cords
and 20 cords are the
like terms, and that $12 is the third term, and of the same denomina-
tion as the answer or required term.
If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords?
more: then the answer or required term will be greater

than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4
cords to 20 cords is *£-, or 5; hence the ratio of $12 to the answer
must be 5, and the answer will be ^ or 5 times $12, which is $60.
2. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what will 4 yards cost?
operation. Analysis. In this example we
48 x fa = $16, Alls. see that 12 yards aud 4 yards are
the like terms and $48 the third
serm, and of the same denomination as the required answer.
If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards?
less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper
fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is •£%; hence the ratio of $48
to the answer is T45, and the answer will be -fe times $48, which is $16.
Rule. I. With the two given numbers, which are of the
same name or kind, form a ratio greater or less than 1,
according as the answer is to be greater or less than the
third given number.
II. Multiply the third number by this ratio, and the pro-
duct will be the required number or answer.
1. Mixed numbers should first be reduced to improper fractions, and the ratio of
the fractions found according to (378).

COMPOUND PROPORTION.
400. Compound Proportion embraces that class of
questions in which the causes, or the effects, or both, are
compound.
The required term may be a cause, or a single element of a
cause; or it may be an effect, or a single element of an effect.

this example the

the length of the
ditch, and is an element of the
second effect. The question,
as stated, will read thus: if 7
men, in 12 days, dig a ditch 60
feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6
feet deep, 21 men, in 2f days,
will dig a ditch how many, or
(blank) feet long, 3 feet wide,
and 8 feet deep?
Rule. I. Of the given terms, select those which constitute
the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange
them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term.
II. Then, if the blank term ( ) occur in either of the ex-
tremes, make the product of the means a dividend, and the
product of the extremes a divisor; but if the blank term occur
in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend,
and the product of fJ\e means a divisor.
1. The causes must be exactly alike in the number and kind of their terms; th»
same is true of the effects.
2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed as in simple
proportion.
401. We will now solve an example according to the
Second Method given in Simple Proportion.

Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple pro-
portions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound ratio,
or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the product will
be the required term.
By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we may
readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be greater
or less than the third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater
than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction; if less, the ratio will
be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction.
First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 42
rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require
18 men, how many men will 28 rods require? less men ; hence the
ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, ff; next, if
16 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require? more
men; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper
fraction, Y'. Regarding the third term as the antecedent of a couplet,
the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply this third term
by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall have the required
term or answer, thus: 18 x f f x .»,* = 24, as shown in the operation.
[2. 5 compositors, in 16 days, of 14 hours each, can com-

.will 10 compositors compose a volume to be printed in the
same letter, containing 40 sheets, 16 pages in a sheet, 60
lines in a page, and 50 letters in a line? Ans. 32 days.

1 „ gwer is to be in days; and we see that
»U the terms appear in pairs or couplets,
'0 P except the 16 days, which is of the same
XA kind as the answer sought.
£m We will proceed to compare the terms
vg 3 of each couplet with the 16 days. First,
. if 5 compositors require 16 days, how
*" many days will 10 compositors require?
40 00 less days; hence the multiplier is the
32 days, Ans. proper fraction T% and we have 16 x &.
Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days,
Hw many days will 7 hours a day require? more days; hence the
multiplier is the improper fraction V, and we have 16 x fig x •*,*•
Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets re-
quire? more days; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction f|},
and we have 16 x yfc x V * ii- Pursuing the same method with the
other couplets, we obtain.the result as shown in the operation.
Rule. I. Of the terms composing each couplet form a
ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the
answer depended on those two and the third or odd term.
II. Multiply the third or odd term by these ratios succes-
sively, and the product will be the answer sought.
By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kind as the answer.
The following examples may be solved by either of the

Case II.
408. To find each partner's share of the profit
or loss when their capital is employed for unequal
periods of time.
It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss
will depend upon two conditions, viz.: the amount of capital
invested by each, and the time it is employed.
1. Two persons form a partnership; A puts in $450 for
7 months, and B $300 for 9 months; they lose $156; how
much is each man's share of the loss?

tire capital for 1 month is equivalent to $3150 + $2700 = $5850. If
the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according to
Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation.
Examples of this kind may also be solved by proportion as in Case I,
the causes being compounded of capital and time; thus,

Rule. Multiply each man's capital by the time it is em-
ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the
entire profit or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to
each product, and the results will be the respective shares of
profit or loss of each partner. Or,
Multiply each man's capital by the time it is employed in
trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum
of the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion,
as in Case I.

ANALYSIS.
409. Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving
problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations
of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps
of the operation according to the special conditions of each
question.
410. In solving questions by analysis, we generally reason
from the given number to unity, or 1, and then from unity,
or 1, to the required number.
411. The vertical line is much used, and by many is
thought to be more convenient, wherever cancellation is
applied. It serves the same purpose as the curved line in
division, since it separates the dividend, or its factors on
the right, from the divisor, or its factors on the left.
The horizontal line may be used by those who prefer it.

31. A man bought 10 bushels of wheat and 25 bushels of
corn for $30, and 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn
for $20; how much a bushel did he give for each?
Analysis. We may divide or
multiply either of the expressions
by such a number as will render
one of the commodities purchased,
alike in both expressions. In this
example we divide the first by 5
to make the numbers denoting
the corn alike, (the same result
would be produced by multiply-
ing the second by 5,) and we have
the cost of 2 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn, equal to $6.
Subtracting this from 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn,
which cost $20, we find the cost of 10 bushels of wheat to be $14;
therefore the cost of 1 bushel is TV of $14, or $1.40. Prom any one oi
the expressions containing both wheat and corn, we readily find the
3ost of 1 bushel of corn to be 64 cents.

they can do fa of it

in 13J or «- days,
they can do ^y of it

B, and C, by work,

working 1 day each
they can do J of J§,
or ^g of the work;
and it will take them
as many days work-
ing together to do
the whole work as £, is contained times in 1, or 8f days.
Now, if we take what any two of them do in 1 day from what the
three do in 1 day, the remainder will be what the third does; we thus
find that A does /B, B Hs5, and C £$.
Next, if we denote the whole work by 1, and divide it by the part
each does in 1 day, we have the number of days that it will take each
to do it alone, viz.: A 26f days, B 40 days, and C 20 days. And each
should receive such a part of $270 as would be expressed by the part
he does in 1 day, multiplied by the number of days he works, which
will give to A $90, B $60, and C $120.

Alligation Medial .and Alligation Alternate.
414. Alligation Medial is the process of finding the
average price or quality of a compound of several simple
ingredients whose prices or qualities are known.
1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a
bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with
15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value
of a bushel of the mixture?
Analysis. Since 40 bushels
of rye at 80 cents a bushel is
worth $32, and 25 bushels of corn
at 70 cents a bushel iB worth
$17.50, and 15 bushels of wheat
at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.50,

415. Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the
proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients,
whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a
required price or quality.

416. To find the proportional quantity to be used
of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality
of the mixture is given.
1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a
bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must be used to
form a mixture worth &5 a bushel?
operation. Analysis. Since on every ingre-
j 2(412 ) dient used whose price or quality
17 4 13 1 Ans. is ifgg than the mean rate there will
be a gain, and on every ingredient
whose price or quality is greater than the mean rate there will be a
loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly equal, the relative
quantities used of each should be such as represent the unit of value.
By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth $2, for $5, there is a gain
of $3; and to gain $1 would require | of a bushel, which we place
opposite the 2. By selling one bushel of clover seed worth $7, for $5,
there is a loss of $2; and to lose $1 would require J of a bushel, which
we place opposite the 7.
In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by the
gain or loss per bushel or pound, etc. Hence, if, every time we take
\ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take ^ of a bushel of clover seed,
id loss will be exactly equal, and we shall have ^ and A foi

If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, we
may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their
numerators, since fractions having a common denominator are to each
other as their numerators. (378) thus, J and £ are equal to f and |,
and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy seed to 3
bushels of clover seed.

10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth
6 shillings a pound?
C
operation. Analysis. To preserve the
equality of gains and losses, we
must always compare two prices
or simples, one greater and one
less than the mean rate, and
treat each pair or couplet as a
separate example. In the given
example we form two couplets,
and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10.
We find that £ of a lb. at 3s. must he taken to gain 1 shilling, and
\ of a lb. at 10s. to lose 1 shilling; also, \ of a lb. at 4s. to gain 1 shil-
ling, and 1 lb. at 7s. to lose 1 shilling. These proportional numbers,
obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in columns 1 and 2.
If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and 2 to a common de-
nominator, and use their numerators, we obtain the integral numbers
in columns 3 and 4, which being arranged in column 5, give the pro-
portional quantities to be taken of each.*
It will be seen that in comparing the simples of any couplet, one of
which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the propor-
tional number finally obtained for either term is the difference between
the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3 and 10, the
proportional number of the former is 4, which is the difference between
10 and the mean rate 6; and the proportional number of the latter is 3,
which is the difference between 3 and the mean rate. The same is
true of every other couplet. Hence, when the simples and the mean
rate are integers, the intermediate steps taken to obtain the final pro-
portional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, may be omitted, and
the same results readily found by taking the difference between each
simple and the mean rate, and placing it opposite the one with which
it is compared.
* Prof. A. B. Oanfield, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. T., used this method of
Alligation, essentially, in the Instruction of his classes as early as 1816, and he was
doubtless the author of it.
/
Rule. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column,
and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left.
II. Form couplets by comparing any price or quality less,
with one that is greater than the mean rate, placing the part
which must be used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less
simple, and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the
greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every
couplet.
III. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may
be reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same
horizontal line, they must be added; the final results will bo
the proportional quantities required.
1. If the numbers in any conplet or column have a common factor, it may be
rejected.
2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or column by any multiplier
we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains and losses, and thus obtain
an indefinite number of lesults, any one of which being taken will give a correct
final result.

"CUBE ROOT.
442. The Cube Boot of a number is one of the three
equal factors that produce the number. Thus, the cube
root of 27 is 3, since 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a cube and
its root. The law governing this relation is exhibited ir
the following examples:

From these examples, we perceive,
1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have from 1 to
3 places in the cube.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds three places to the cube.
If we point off a number into three-figure periods, com-
mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and
the left hand full or partial period will indicate the number
of places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the
highest figure of the root.
444. 1. What is the length of one side of a cubical
block containing 413494 solid inches?
operation—commenced. Analybis. Since the block is a
413494 I 74 cube, its side will be the cube root
34.3 of its solid contents, which we will
proceed to compute. Pointing off
147UU 7U4K4 tke gjven number, the two periods
show that there will be two figures,
tens and units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted
from the first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thou-
sands is 343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens; we therefore write 7 tens
in the root at the right of the given number.
CUBE ROOT.
323

Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a
cubical block (Fig. I), the side
of which is 70 inches in length.
The contents of this cube are
70 x 70 x 70 = 343,000 solid
inches, which we subtract from
the given number. This is done
in the operation by subtracting
the cube number, 343, from the
first period, 413, and to the re-
mainder bringing down the sec-
ond period, making the entire
remainder 70494.
If we now enlarge our cubical
block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a man-
ner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of the required
block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition must be made upon
three adjacent sides or faces. The addition will therefore be com-
posed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces, (Fig. II); 3 oblong blocks
to fill the vacancies at the edges, (Fig. Ill); and 1 small cubical block
to fill the vacancy at the corner, (Fig. IV.) Now, the thickness of this
enlargement will be the additional length of the side of the cube,
and, consequently, the second figure in the root. To find thickness,
we may divide solid contents by turface, or area. But the area of
the 3 oblong blocks and lit-
tle cube cannot be found
till the thickness of the ad-
dition be determined, be-
cause their common breadth
is equal to this thickness.
We will therefore find the
area of the three flat blocks,
which is sufficiently near
the whole area to be used
as a trial divisor. As these
are each equal in length and
breadth to the side of the
cube whose faces they cover,
the whole area of the three
is 70 x 70 x 3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the
operation by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7; the re-
sult being written at the left haud of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

4, the probable thickness of the addition, and second figure of the
root. With this assumed figure,
we will complete our divisor by
adding the area of the 4 blocks,
before undetermined. The 3 ob-
long blocks are each 70 inches
long; and the little cube, being
equal in each of its dimensions
to the thickness of the addition
must be 4 inches long. Hense,
their united length is 70 + 70
+ 70 + 4 = 214. This number
is obtained in the operation by
multiplying the 7 by 3, and an-
nexing the 4 to the product, the
result being written in column
I, on the next line below the
trial divisor. Multiplying 214,
the length, by 4, the common
width, we obtain 856, the area of
the four blocks, which added to
14700, the trial divisor, makes
15556, the complete divisor; and
multiplying this by 4, the second
figure in the root, and subtract-
ing the product from the divi-
dend, we obtain a remainder of
8270 solid inches. With this re-
mainder, for the same reason as
before, we must proceed to make
a new enlargement. But since
we have already two figures in
the root, answering to the two
periods of the given number,
the next figure of the root must
be a decimal; and we therefore
annex to the remainder a period
of three decimal ciphers, mak-
ing 8270.000 for a new dividend.
The trial divisor to obtain the
thickness of this second enlarge-
ment, or the next figure of the root, will be the area of three new flat
blocks to cover the three sides of the cube already formed; and thia

surface, (Pig. IV,) is composed of 1 face of each of the flat Mocks
already used, 2 faces of each of the oblong blocks, and 3 faces of
the little cube. But we have in the complete divisor, 15556, 1 face
of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube; and in the
correction of the trial divisor, 856, 1 face of each of the oblong blocks
and of the little cube; and in the square of the last root figure, 16, a
third face of the little cube. Hence, 16 + 856 + 15556 = 16428, the
significant figures of the new trial divisor. This number is obtained
in the opera
tion by adding
the square of
the last root
figure mental-
ly, and com-
bining units
of like order,
thus: 16, 6,
and 6 are 28,
and we write
the unit figure in the new trial divisor; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5
are 12, etc. We annex 2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former,
and dividing, obtain 5, the third figure in the root. To complete the
second trial divisor, after the manner of the first, the correction may
be found by annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multi-
plying this number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7,
with 4 annexed, or 214, we need only multiply the last figure, 4, by 3, and
annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111.25, the correc-
tion required. Then we obtain the complete divisor, 16539.25, the pro-
duct, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the manner shown by the for-
mer steps. From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of thrse
figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest cube that does not exceed the left hand
period, and write its root for the first figure in the required
root; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the
remainder bring down the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write three times the square
of the first figure of the root, and annex tivo ciphers, for a trial
divisor; divide the dividend by the trial divisor, and write
the quotient for a trial figure in the root.
IV. Annex the trial figure to three- limes the former figure,
and write the result in a column marked I, one line below the
trial divisor; multiply this term by the trial figure, and write
the product on the same line in a column marked II; add
this term as a correction to the trial divisor, and the result
will be the complete divisor.
V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and
subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder
bring down the next period for a new dividend.
VL Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last
term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and an-
nex two ciphers, for a new trial divisor; with which obtain
another trial figure in the root.
VII. Multiply the unit figure of the last term in column I
by 3, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term
of column I; multiply this result by the trial figure of the root
for the next term of column II; add this term to the trial
divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before.
1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend, diminish the trial
figure of the root, and correct tho erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the trial divisor, and
another period to the dividend; then proceed as before with column I, annexing
both cipher and trial figure.

ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION,,
445. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a
series of numbers increasing or decreasing by a common dif-
ference. Thus, 3, 5, 7, 9,11, etc., is an arithmetical pro-
gression with an ascending series, and 13,10, 7, 4, etc., is an
arithmetical progression with a descending series.
446. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which
it is composed.
447. The Extremes are the first and last terms.
448. The Means are the intermediate terms.
449. The Common Difference is the difference between
any two adjacent terms.
450. There are five parts in an arithmetical series, any
three of which being given, the other two may be found.
They are as follows: the first term, last term, common dif-
ference, number of terms, and sum of all the terms^
Case L
451. To find the last term when the first term,
common difference, and number of terms are given.
Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the
common difference; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8,
11,14, or analyzed thus: 2, 2 + 3,2 + 3+3, 2 + 3+3 +
3, 2 + 3 + 3+3 + 3.
Here we se"^ that, in an ascending series, we obtain the
adding the common difference once to the first
rd term, by adding the common difference
it term; and, in general, we obtain any term
by adding the common difference as many times to the first
term as there are terms less one.
The analysis for a descending series would be similar.
Rule. Multiply the common difference by the number of
terms less one, and add the product to the first term, if the
series be ascending, and subtract it if the series be descending.
Examples for Practice.
1. The first term of an ascending series is 4, the common
difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last
term? Ans. 58.
2. What is the 13th term of a descending series whose
first term is 75, and common difference 5? Ans. 15.
3. A hoy bought 18 hens, paying 2 cents for the first, 5
cents for the second, and, 8 cents for the third, in arith-
metical progression; what did he pay for the last hen?
4. What is the 40th term of the series \,\,\, 1\, etc.?
Ans. 10J.
5. A man travels 9 days; the first day he goes 20 miles,
the second 25 miles, increasing 5 miles each day; how far
does he travel the last day of his journey? Ans. 60 miles.
6. What is the amount of $100, at 7 per cent., for 45
years? $100 + $7 x 45 = $415, Ans.
Case II.
452. To find the common difference when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times as there are terms less one; thus, by taking away 2 in
the fifth term, 2 + 3+3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times.
Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number
of terms less one.

the number of terms is 34; what is the common difference?
4. An invalid commenced to walk for exercise, increasing
the distance daily by a common difference; the first day he
walked 3 miles, and the 14th day 9£ miles; how many miles
did he walk each day?
When we have fotmd the common difference we may add it once, twice, etc, to
the hrst term, and we have the series, and consequently the means.
Ans. 3, 3£, 4, 4£, 5, 5£, etc.
Case IIL
453. To find the number of terms when the ex-
tremes and common difference are given.
Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we also see that after taking away the first term from any
term, we have left, the common difference taken as many
times e3 the number of terms, less 1.
Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common
difference, and add 1 to the quotient.
Examples for Practice.
1. The extremes are 7 and 43, and the common difference
is 4; what is the number of terms? Ans. 10.
2. The first term is 2£, the last term is 40, and the common
difference is' 7|; what is the number of terms? Ans. 6.
3. A laborer agreed to build a fence on the following con-
ditions: for the first rod he was to have 6 cents, with an in-
crease of 4 cents on each successive rod; the last rod came
to 226 cents; how many rods did he build? Ans. 56 rods.
Case IV.
454. To find the sum of all the terms when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
To deduce a rule for finding the sum of all the terms, we
will take the series 2, 5, 8, 11,14, writing it under itself in
an inverse order, and add each term; thus,
2 + 5+ 8 + 11 +14 = 40, once the sum.
14 + 11 + 8 + 5 + 2 = 40, " ""
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 80, twice the sum-
Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, mul-
tiplied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice
the sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is
the sum required.
Rule. Multiply the sum of the extremes by the number of
terms, and divide the product by 2.
Examples for Practice.
1. The extremes are 5 and 32, and the number of terms
12 ; what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 222.
2. How many strokes does a common clock make in 12
hours? Ans. 78 strokes.

4. Suppose 100 apples were placed in a line 2 yards apart,
and a basket 2 yards from the first apple; how far would a
boy travel to gather them up singly, and return with each
separately to the basket? Ans. 20200 yards.
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION".
455. A Geometrical Progression is a series of num-
bers increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier.
When the multiplier is greater than a unit, the series ia
ascending; thus, 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series,
in which 3 is the multiplier.
When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is de-
scending j thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in
which 4. is the multiplier.
456. The Ratio is the constant multiplier.
457. In every geometrical progression there are five
parts to be considered, any three of which being given, the
other two may be determined. They are as follows: The
first term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of
all the terms.
The first and last terms are the extremes, and tne inter-
mediate terms are the means.
Case I.
458. To find any term, the first term, the ratio,
and number of terms being given.
The first term is supposed to exist independently of the
ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second
term; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third
term; using it three times, or its third power, we have the
fourth term; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any
term is one less than the number of the term. The ascend-
ing series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 x 3, 2
x3 x3, 2 x 3 x 3 x 3.
In this illustration we see that *
1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio.
2d term, 6 = 2x3 = the first term into the 1st power of
the ratio.
3d term, 18 = 2 x 3* = the first term into the 2d power
of the ratio.
4th term, 54 = 2 x 3s = the first term into the 3d power
of the ratio.
Tultiply the first term by that power of the ratio
%e number of terms less 1.

3 ; what is the 9th term? Ans. 4 x 38 = 26244.
2. The first term is 1024, the ratio \, and the number of
terms 8; what is the last term? Ans. "fa.
3. A boy bought 9 oranges, agreeing to pay 1 mill for
the first orange, 2 mills for the second, and so on; what
did the last orange cost him? Ans. $.256.
4. The first term is 7, the ratio \, and the number of
terms 7; what is the last term? Ans. ie|0,.
5. What is the amount of $1 at compound interest for 5
years, at 7 per cent. per annum? Ans. $1.40255 + .
In the above example the first term is $1, the ratio is $1.07, and the number ol
terms is 6.
6. A drover bought 7 oxen, agreeing to pay $3 for the
first ox, $9 for the second, $27 for the third, and so on;
what did the last ox cost him? Ans. $2187.
Case II
459. To find the sum of all the terms, the ex-
tremes and ratio being given.
If we take the series 2, 8, 32,128, 512, in which the ratio
is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms
thus multiplied, we shall have
8 + 33 + 128 + 512 + 2048 = 2728 =
But 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 - 682-
Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048-2 = 2046 =
Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046-=-3 = 682 =
Four times the sum of
all the terms.
Once the sum of all the
terms.
Three times the sum of
all the terms.
Once the sum of all the
terms.
The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or
series from the upper. All the terms cancel except 2048
and 2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum,
and dividing by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the
sum of all the terms.
Rule. Multiply the greater extreme by the ratio, subtract
the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder
by the ratio less 1.
Let every decreasing series be inverted, and the first term called the last; then the
ratio will be greater than a unit. If the series be infinite, the first term is a cipher.
Examples for Practice.
1. The first term is 2, the last term 486, and the ratio 3;
what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 728.
2. The first term is 4, the last term is 262144, and the
ratio is 4; what is the sum of the series? Ans. 349524.
3. The first term of a descending series is 162, the last
term 2, and the ratio \; what is the sum? Ans. 242.
4. What i3 the value of \, fa, -j-J-j, etc., to infinity? Ans. £.
In the following examples we first find the last term by the Role under Case I.

ments, the first being $2, the second $6, and the third $18,
and so on, in geometrical progression? Ans. $531440.
6. If a grain of wheat produce 7 grains, and these be
sown the second year, each yielding the same increase, how
many bushels will Jbe produced at this rate in 12 years, if

MENSURATION OF LINES AND SUPERFICIES.
4G0. In taking the measure of any line, surface, or solid, we are
always governed by some denomination, a unit of which is called the
Unit of Measure. Thus, if any lineal measure be estimated in feet,
the unit of measure is 1 foot; if in inches, the unit is 1 inch. If any
superficial measure be estimated in feet, the unit of measure is 1
square foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 square yard.
401. If any solid or cubic measure be estimated in feet, the unit of
measure is 1 cubic foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 cubic yard.
4612. The area of a figure is its superficial contents, or the
surface included within any given lines,

METRIC SYSTEM.

THE METRIC SYSTEM.*

The three dimensions of this cube are, 1 Meter, or
10 Decimeters, or 100 Centimeters, in length. 1 Cn. Centimeter.
Scale A of the Exact Sine. Exact Size.
481. The Metric System of Weights and Measures
has now received the sanction of law among more than half
the inhabitants of the civilized world. Up to this date it
has been adopted in France, Germany, Austria, the Nether-
lands, Southern Europe, and South America, and has been
legalized in Great Britain, Germany, and the United
States.
* The Metric System, as it was presented in all the editions of this
book, printed previous to 1877, was useless, because the symbols and
applications did not correspond with present usage.
This will be a sufficient reason for substituting in place of the
former matter, a condensed and practical treatise of the system,
together with some useful miscellaneous tables.
METRIC SYSTEM.
482. The Metric System of weights and measures is based
upon the decimal scale.
483. The Meter is the base of the system, and is the one ten
millionth part of the distance on the earth's surface from the equator
to either pole, or 39.37079 inches.
From the Meter are made the Ar (are), the Liter (leeter), and the
Oram; these constitute the primary or principal units of the system,
from which all the others are derived.
484. The Multiple Units, or higher denominations, are
named by prefixing to the name of the primary units the Greek
numerals, Deka (10), Hecto (100), Kilo (1000), and Myra (10000).
485. The Sub-Multiple Units, or lower denominations, are
named by prefixing to the names of the primary units the Latin
numerals, Bed (-fo), Centi (rij), MiUi (-nj^).
Hence, it is apparent from the name of a unit whether it is greater
or less than the standard unit, and also how many times.
Meter means measure; and the three principal units are length,
capacity or volume, and weight.

The Meter, like our yard, is the unit used in measuring cloths
and short distances.
The Kilometer is commonly used for measuring long distances, and
is about £ of a common mile.
The Centimeter and Millimeter are used by mechanics and others
for minute lengths. The Dekameler, Hektometer, and Myriameter are
seldom used.
The Square and Cubic Measures are only the squares and cubes of
the measures of length, as shown in the following tables.

The Square Meter is the unit for measuring ordinary surfaces of
small extent.
The Ar is the unit of land measure, and is a square whose side is
10 meters, equal to a square dekameter, or 119.6 square yards.
CUBIC MEASURE.

The Cubic Meter is the unit for measuring ordinary solids.
The Ster is the unit of wood measure, and is equal to a cubic
meter, or .2759 cord.
A Cubic Meter of water weighs 1000 kilos, or a metric ton.
The scale for the meter, liter. anAoram is uniformly 10; but in the
scale for the square meter, 100 units of any order make one unit of
the next higher; and in the scale for the cubic meter, 1000 units of
any order make one of the next higher.

495. To change the Metric to the Common
System.
1. 3.6 Km., how many feet?
operation. Analysts. The meter is
3.6 Km. x 1000 = 3600 M. <** principal unit of the table;
39.37 in. x 3600=141732 in. hence we reduoe the Mome-j:
, < -i won • i o • 11011 w ters t0 meters. Since there
141732 in.--12 in.=11811 ft . ftre 39 37 inches „ a meter, in
3600 meters there are 3600 times 39.37 inches; and since there are
12 inches in a foot, there are as many feet as 12 inches are contained
times in 141732 inches. Therefore 3.6 Km. are equal to 11811 feet.
Role. Reduce the given quantity to the denomination of
the principal unit of the table; multiply o\, the equivalent,
and reduce the product to the required denomination.

1. In 10 lbs. 4 oz. how many kilograms?
operation. Analysis. The
10 lbs. 4 oz. = 10.25 lbs. gram, the principal
10.25 lbs. x 7000 = 71750 gr. unit of the table, te
71750 gr.H-15.432 gr. = 4649.43 G. expressed in grains.
4649.43 G.-^1000 = 4.64943 Kg., Ans. J^T^t.
to grains. 15.432 grains make one gram ; hence there are as many
grams in 71750 grains as 15.432 grains is contained times in 71750
grains. And since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, dividing
4649.43 Q. hy 1000 will give the kilograms in 10 lh. 4 oz. Therefore,
10 lb. 4 oz. is equal to 4.64943 Kg.
Rule. Reduce the given quantity to the denomination in
