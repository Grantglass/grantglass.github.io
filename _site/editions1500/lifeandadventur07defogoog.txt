thing would fcrve me, -but I muft go to fea, both 
againft the will of my father, the tears of my mother, 
and the entreaties of friends. One morning my 
father expoftulated very warmly with me : Says he, 
wbat reafon hav^e vou to leave your native country, 
where there muft be a more certain profpe<9: of con- 
teat and happinefs, than to enter into a wandering con- 
dition of uneafinefs and uncertainty? He recom- 
mended to me Agar^% wifli, neither to defire adverfity^ 
nor riches ; that a middle ftate of life was the moft 
happy J and that the high towering thoughts of raif- 
ing our condition by wandering abroad, were fur- 
rounded^with mifery and danger, and often ended 
with confufion and di (appointment : I entreat you, 
nay I command you, fays he^ to defift from thefe in- 
tentions : Confider your cldeft brother, who Laid 
down his life for his honour, or rather loft it for his 
difobedience to my will. If you wiH go, "^d'dded hey.

tion ; but a time may come, when, defolate, op- 
preft, or forfaken, you may wilh you had taken your 
poor'defpifcd father's counifel—^—He pronounced thefe 
wordj. with fuch a moving and paternal eloquence, 
while floods of tears ran down his aged cheeksj^ 
that fcemed to ftcm the torrent of my rcfolutions. 
But this wore ofiF foon, and a little after I informed 
my mother, that I could not fettle to any bufmefs, 
my refolutions were fo ftrong to fee the ivorld ; and 
begged fhe would gain my father's confent, only to 

fo one voyage, which if it did not prove ptofperous 
would never attempt^Jr fccond : But my defire 
was as vain as my foli^ in afking : my mother pafE- 
onately expreft her diflikeofthis propofal, telling me. 
That asjkefaw I was bent upon my own deJiruSfion^ 
contrary to their will and my duty^ fin would fay no

[ 7 1 
• I was thm, I think, nineteen years old, when 
one time being at //«//, I met a rchool-fcllow of 
mine, going along with his father, who was «nafter 
of a (hip, to London : And acquainting him with my 
wandering defires, hcaflured me of my free paflage, 
and a plentiful fliare of what was neccflary. Thus^ 
without imploring a bicffing, or taking a farewell of 
my parents, I took fliipping on the firft of Septemtir 
1651. When our fliip having no fooner left the 
Humber a-fiern, but there arofe fuch a violent ftorm^ 
and being extremely fea-fick, I thought the judg- 
ments of God defervedly followed me for my dif- 
obcdience to my dear parents. It was then only 
I called to mind the good advice of my father ; 
bow eafy and comfortable was a middle flate of lile ; 
and if it pleafed God to (ct me on dry land once 
morfe, I would return to my parents, implore .their 
forgiveness^ and bid a final auieu to my wandering 
inclinations. 

Such wtr." my thoughts while the ftorm conti^ 
nued ; but thefc good refolutions decreafcd wi:h the 
danger. More efpecially, when rn,- companion c^nie 
tome, clapping me on the fhouldcr : IVhat^ Dob I 
faid he, , fun you was not fright md luji night with 

fcarce a cap- full of wind f jfnd do you^ cry'd I, 

call fuch a violent Jiorm a cap-full of wind f A 
Jhrm yoiifool you, faid he, this is nothing ; a good 
fhip and fea-room always baffle fuch a foolijh f quail 
of wind as that : But yoiCre a frejh-w^ter Juihr : 
come, boy, turn out, fee what fine weather we have 
now, and a good howl of punch will drown all your 
paji forrows. In (hgrt, the pu/ich was made, I was 
drunk, and in one night's time drowned bcih my 
repentance and my good refoJr.tions, entirely for- 
getting the vows and promi'es 1 f. ade in my diftrefs.: 
And whenever any reficclions wo-*iu r^'turn en me, 
what by company and drinkir.^ , [ focm maflered 
thofe fits, as I deridingly called them. But this only 

made

made way for another trial, whereby I coultf 
net but fee how much I was beholden to kind Pro- 
vidence. 

Upon the fixth day, we came to an anchor in 
Haj-wich road, wh.re we lay \vi;.d- bound with fome 
Niwcafile Hiv^s \ and there beinjr good anchorage, 
and our cables found, the feamcn forgot their late 
foil and da'ngtr, and fpent their time as merry as 
if they had been on fliore. But on the eighth day 
there arofe fuch a biifk gale of wind, which pre- 
"Ventc4 our tiding it up the river, and ftill incrcaf-- 
ing, our do rid fore-cafllc in, having fliipped fe*- 
Vtral large feas. 

It was not long before horror fei2:ed tbe feamen 
therafilves, when i heard the matter ex prefs this me- 
Jancholly ejaGui-ation, Lord ifrjn mercy upon us^ we 
Jhall be all loft end undme T ¥ or- my part, fick unto 
death, I kept my cabin, till the univenal and moft 
dreadful apprehcnfions amon^ us of our fpeedy fate, 
made inc ^^et up upon deck ; and there I was dreadfully 
affrighted mdeed : The fea went mountains high ; I 
could fee nothing but diftrefs around us : Two fliips 
hafiS cut their mafts on board, and'another waisf foun- 
dered : Two more, that had loft their anchors, were 
forced out to the mercy of the ocean; and to fave 
our lives, wfc were forced to cut our fore-mjift and 
main-niaft quite away-. 

Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my 
dreadful condition? I was but a frefh water fallor, 
and therefore it fcemcJmore terrible. Our fhip was 
very good, but too much loaden, which made the 
feiiors often cry out, She would founder ; words T. 
then was igiorantof ! A!l this ^^'hile the ftorm con- 
tinuing, the raaft«r r.nd the more, fober p^rt of his 
men went to prayers, expc<^rng dtiath every mo-. 
ment- In the tniddle of tr? night oik cried rvjt, If^e 
l^djp'rung a leak ; anoth^r.^ That there was Ji?ir fcot 
water in the hold* I-was ju^ft. ready -to- exp^i^ wiclY

fbar, whf n immediately all hands were called to the 
pump ; and the men forced me alfo in that cxtremi- 
ty to (hare with them in their labour. While thuf 
employed, the mnftcr efpying fome light colliers^ 
fired a gun as a fignal of didrcfs ; which I not un- 
iderftanding what it meant, and thinking that either 
the ihip broke, or fome dre;^ful thing happened, 
fell into a fwoon ; but in that common condition of 
woe, nobodv minded me, excepting to thruft me 
afide with tncir feet, thinking me dead, and it was 
a great while before 1 recover^. 

Happy it was for us, when upon the fi^nai given» 
they ventured out their boats to fave our lives. All 
pur pumping had been in vain, and vain bad their at- 
tempts been, had they not ^ome to our fliip's fide, 
when our men caft them a rope over a-ftern with a 
buoy to it, which after great labour they got hold 
of, and we bawling them to us, got into their boat. 
So leaving our (hip, we perceived it fink in lefe than 
a quarter of an hour, by which I knew what wat 
foundering^ at fia.s Aiid now the men inceflantly 
laboured to recover their own ihip, but the fea ran 
fo high, and the wind blowing hard, they. thought 
it convenient to hawl within /lioire \ which with great 
difficulty and danger at laft we happily afFcdted^ 
laiidineat a place called Grtmer^ not far from Win^ 
terton licht-houfe : From whence we all walked to 
Tarmoiith^ wh6re, as obje£l8 of pity, many good 
people furniihed us with neccflaries for our fubfift-« 
ance either to Hull or London, 

'Tis ftrange, that after all this, like the Prodigal 
Son, I did not return to my ftither j who hv^^ring oftho 
fhip's calamity, for a long time thouk^ht mc entoni^x:d 
in the deep. No doubt but 1 IhouTd hav^; Jhartd in

When 



. [ lO 1 - 

When I bpd been at Yarmouth three days, I met 
my old companion, who hf^rl given me the invitation 
to go on-board along with his father. His behaviour 
and fpeech was altered, and in a melancholy manner 
afked me how I did, telling his father who I was, 
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to 
proceed farther abroad : Upon which the old gentle- 
man turning to me gravely faid, Toung marij you 
tught never to go to fea any more^ hut to take this for a 
certain Jign. that you will never profper in^ fea-faring 
condition. Sir, anfwered /, will you take the fame 
refohition ? *Tis a diff'erent c<ije^ faid he, *iis my 
calling,^ ana confequenHy my duty j but as you have 
made this voyage for a trial j you fee uhat ill fuccefs 
heaven has fet before yolhr eyes\ and perhaps oiir mi-^ 
feries have been on your account^ like Jonah in the fhip 
of Tarfhifli : hut pray what are you and on what ac^ 
count did you go to fea f Upon which I very freely 
declared my -whole ftory ; at the end of which he 
made this exclamatioif, Ye facred powers ! what 
bad I committed, that fuch a wretch fhould enter in- 
to my (hip to heap upon me fuch a deluge of mi- 
feries ! But foon recolicfting bis palTion^, Young man^ 
faid he, depend upon it, if you do not go hack, where^ 
ever you go, you will meet with difajiers and difappoint- 
mentSy till your fathers words are fulfilled upon you. 
Ajid fo we parted. 

I thought at firft to return home, but fhame op- 
pofed that good motion, as thinking I fhould be. 
laughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So 
ftraoge is the nature of youth, who arc tot afhamed 
to fin bu.t yet afliamed to repent ; and far from being 
alhamed of thofe anions Rr which they may be ac- 
counted fools, think it folly in returning to their du- 
ty, which is the principal mark, of wifdom. In 
inort I travelled up to London^ refolvcd upon a voy- 
age J and a voyage I (con heard of, by my acquaint- 
fMicg'vv'ith a captain who took a fancy to mc, to go 

to 



t " ] 

to the coaftof Guinea. Having- funic monry, ind 
appearing like a gentleman, I vVvjnL on boirJ, not 
as a common failor or forc-maft-miia ; nay, t;:c com* 
mandcr agreed I fhould go that voya<;c with him 
without any expencc; that I ihould be his mcfs-matc 
and companion ; and I was verv welcome to carry 
any thing with me, and make the bcfl merchandize 
I could. 

I blefTed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked 
my Captain for his oflcr ; when acquainting my 
friends in Yorkjhht^ forty pounds were fcnt nie,«thc 
grcatcft part of which I believe my dear father and ' 
mother contributed to ; and with which I bought 
toys and trifles as the captain direAcd me. My 
captain alfo learned me navigation, how to keep an 
account of ^he (hip's courfe, take an obfervation, 
and led me into t^e knowledge of feveral ufcful 
branches of the mathematics. And indeed this voy- 
age made me both a failor and merchant : I^'or I 
brought home 5 pounds 9 ounces of gold dud for 
my adventure, which produced at my return to 
London^ almoft three hundred pounds. But in this 
voyage I was . extremely fick being thrown into 
^violent calenture, through cxccffivc heat, trading 
upon the coaft, fn)m the latitude of 15 degrees 
north, even to the line itfelf. 

But alas ! my dear friend the captain foon departed 
this life after his arrival. This was a fcnfible grief 
to nie 5 yet 1 1 tfolvcd to go another voyage with his 
mate, v/ho lud now got command of the fliip. 
But thi. proved uiifuccefsful j for though I did not 
ca/ry Ljuirt: J 00/. of my late acquired wealth, fotiiat 
I h..d -<ioc>. Kft, v/liich 1 depofited with the capt;»iji's 
widow, who .vas an honcft gentlewoman, yet my 
misfor uacs iu thif roya-je were very grc^at upon in« \ 
for '^Ui ihip failing towards the Canary iflands, we 
Wv'ic clu».('uJ by w Sake rover ; and in fpiio of all

[ 21 ] 

vafs as our y^rds would fpread, or mails carr}% the 
pyrate gained upon us, and fo we prepared ourfclvcs 
to fight. They had i8 guns, and we had but 12. 
About three in the afternoon there was a defperate 
engagement, wherein many were killed and wound- 
ed on both fides; but finding ourfelves overpowered 
with numbers, our (hip difabled, and ourfelves too 
impotent to have the leaft hopes of fuccefs, we were 
forced to furrender, and accordingly were all carried 
into the port of Sake. Our men were fent to the 
Emperor's court to be fold there ; but the pyrate 
'captain taking notice of me, kept me to be his own 
ilave. 

In this condition I thought myfelf themoft jnife- 
rable creature on earthy and the prophcfy of my fa- 
ther c^me afrcfh into my thoughts. As it happened, 
my condition' viras bcfter than I thought it to be, as 
will foon appear. Some hopes indeed t had, that 
my new patron would go to fea again,where he might 
be taken by a Spani/h or Portugal man of war, 
and then I mould be fct at liberty. But in tKU I w.as 
miftaken, for he never took me with him, but left 
me to look after his little garden, and do the drudgery 
ofhishoufe; and when he returned from fea, wbuld 
make me lie in the cabin, and look after the fhip. 
I hskd no one that I could communicate my thoughts 
to, which were continually meditating my cfcape^ 
no Englijhman^ Irijbman^ or Scotchman here y but my- 
felf; and for two years I could fee nothing pradti- 
cable, but only pleafe myfelf with the imagmation* 
After fomc len^h of time, my patron, as I 
found, grew fo poor, that he could not fit out his 
fhrp as ufual : And then he ufcd conftantly, once or 
twice a week, if the weather was fair, to go out a 
fifliing, taking me and a young Morefco boy to row 
the boat ; and fo much pleafed was he with me for 
my dexterity in catching the filh, that he would 

joften 



[ 13 1 

often fend me with z Mo^r ; who was one of his 
kinfmen, and the Mwefco youth, to catch a di(h of 
fifh for him. 

One morning, as we were at the fport, theit arofe 
fuch a thick fog, that we loft fight of the fhore ; 
and rowing we know not which way, we laboured 
all the night, and in the mornine found ourfelves in 
the ocean, two leagues from land ; however, we at- 
tained there at length, and we made the greater 
hafte, becaufe our ftomachs were exceeding (harp 
and hungry. But the better to prevent fuch difaften , 
my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little ftate- 
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with 
a place behind it to fteer and hawl home ^e main- 
iheet, with other conveniencies, to keep him from 
the weather, as alfo lockers to put in all mann^* of 
provifions ; with a handfome (boulder of mutton 
fail, gibing over the cabin. 

In this he frequently took us a fifhing ; and one 
time inviting two or three perfons of diftin£lion to 

So with him, made provifion extraordinary, provi- 
ing alfo three fuzees, with powder and mot, that 
they might have (bme fport at fowling along the fea 
coaft. The next morning, the boat being clean, 
her antients and pendents out, and e^ry thing 
ready, their minds altering, my patron ordered us 
to go a fifhing, for that his guefts would certainly 
fup with him that night. 

And now I began to think of my deliverance in« 
deed : In order to this, I perfuaded the Moor to get 
fbme provifions on board, as not daring to meddle 
with our patron's ; who, taking my advice, we 
ftored ourfelves with rufk bifcuit, and three jars of 
water ; befides, I privately conveyed into the boat 
a bottle of brandy, fome twine, thread, a ham- 
mer, hatchet, and . a faw \ in particular fome bees- 
wax, which was a ereat comfort to me, and ferved 
to inalfc candles. I. then perfuaded ^»/fy (for fo 
B was

irar the M^tr called) to pnxniie fixne p6wder 
IhoC, pretending to kill fea curlieus, to which be 
innocently and readily agreed. And in ihort, bein^ 
provided with all things necefiary, we failed out, 
refolving for my ov/n part to make my efcape, thougll 
it might coft me my life. 

When we had pafled the caftle, we fell to fiihing; 
but though I knew there was a bite, I diflembled £c 
matter, in order to put farther out to fea. Accord-* 
tngly we ran a league farther-; when giving the bojf 
the helm, and pretending to ftoop for fomething, 1 
ieized MuUj by furprife, and threw him.ovefrIx^ird« 
He was an excellent fwimmer, foon aroie, and miKle 
-towards the boat -y upon which I took out a fuzec^ 
and prdented it at him : Muley^ faid I, / never jA 
deftgned to do you any barmy and.feek nothing now but 
my redemption* I know, you are able enough to' Jwim

harmlefs creature, at thefe words, turned himfelf 
from me, and I make no 'doubt got. fafe to: landi 
Then turning to the boy Xury^ I perceived he

refolved, about dufki(h, to fwim alhore. But

[ i6 ] 

The next morning, I was refolded to go cm ihoK 
to get frefh water, and venture my life among beafts 
or ravages, (hould either attack me. Xury (aid he 
woul^ take one of the jars and bring me fome. I 
aiked him why he would go, and not I. Thepoor 
boy anfwered, if wild mwm C9me^ they tat nuy you p 
muaj. A mind fcarcely now to be imitated, fo con- 
trary to felf-prefervation, the moft powerful law of 
nature ! This indeed encreafed my afiedion to the 
child. WM^ dear Xury, faid I, wt wiU hoth g$ 
aJhoTfy both tat wild mansy and they JhaU eat ruitber 
if us. So giving Xury a piece of rufk bread to eat, 
and a dram, we waded afbore, carrying nothing widi 
us but our arms, and two jars for water. I did not 
go out of fight of the boat, as dreading the lavages 
coining down the river in their canoes. But the boy 
feeing a low defcent, or vale, about a mile in the 
country, he wandered to it \ and then running back 
to me with great precipitation, I thought he was 
purfued by fome favage or wild beaft, upon which I 
approached, refolving to perifh or protect him from 
dianger. As he came nearer to me, I faw fomething 
banging over his (houlders, which was a creature 
he had (hot, like a hare, but different in colour, and 
longer legs j however, we were glad of it, for it 
proved wholefome nourifhing meat ; but what added 
to our joy was, my boy aflured me there was plenty 
of water, and that he fee no wild mam : And greater 
ftill v«as our comfort, when we found freOi water in 
the creek, where we were, when the tide was out, 
without g >ing fo for up into the country. 

In this place I began to confider that the Canary 
and the Cape de Verd iflands lay not far off; but ha- 
ving no inftrument, I knew not what latitude, or 
when to (land off to fea for them j yet my hopes were, 
I (hould meet fome of the Englijh trading veflcls, 
who would relieve and take us up. 

The 



C »7 1 

The place I was in was, no doubt, that wild fort 
of country, inhabited onlv bj a few, that lies be- 
tween the Emperor of morocco*^ dominions and the 
Negroes: It was filled witH wild beafts, and thfe 
Mm% ufe it for hunting chiefly. From this place I 
thought I faw the top of the mountain Tenerijfe^ in 
the Canaries ; which made me try twice to attain tr^ 
but as often was I drove back, and fo forced to pur* 
file my fortune along the fhore. 

Early one morning we came to an anchor under % 
little point of land, but pretty high, and the tide 
beginning to flow, we lay ready to go farther in : 
But Xmy;, whofe youthful and penetrating eyes 
were fharperthan mmc, ina foft tone, dcfired me to 
keep far from land, left we Ihould be devoured : For 
look yonder J Meyter^ faid he, and fa ie dreadful mon^ 
Jkr faji afkep on the fide of the bilL Accordingly, 
lookmg where he pointed, I cfpied a fearful monftcr 
indeed \ it was a terrible great lion that lay on (horc. 
Covered as it were by the fliade of a piece of the hill. 
JBiry, faid I, you jhall go on Jhore and kill him. But 
the boy looked amazed : Me kill him^ fays he, he eat 
me at one mouth \ meaning one mouthful. Upon 
which I bid him He ftill, and charging my biggeft 

fun with two (lugs, and a good charge of powder, 
took the beft aim I could* to fhoot him through the 
head j but his leg! ving over his nofc, the Aug broke 
his knee-bone, Tne Ron, awaking with the pain, 
got up, but foon RH dowrt, giving the moft hideous 
groan I ever heard: But takmg my fccond piece, I 
Ihot him thro' the head, and then he lay ftru2;^llng for 
life. Upon this Jfwry took heart, and defiredmy kave 
to go on fhore. Go then^ faid I. Upon which, taking 
a little gun in one hand, hefwam to fhore with the 
other, and coming cloft /to the Lion, put a period 
to his life, by fhooting him again through the head*. 
• But this was fj^eriding our ammufiition in vain, 
the.flc{hr not being ijood toeat. Xuryy/?iS like a chain-

pion, and comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off 
the head of his enemy i which not having; ftrengtb 
to perform, cut off a foot. But I bethought mpdi 
that his (kin would be of great ufe, which coft Xinj 
and I a whole day's work ; when fpreading it on tbtf 
top of our cabin, the hot beams of the fun fo effec- 
tually dried it, in two days time, that it afterwards 
ferved me for a bed to lie upon. 

And now we failed fouthwardly, living fparingly 
on our provifions, and went no oftener on fliore than 
we were obliged for freih water. My defign was to 
make the river Gambia or SenegaJy or any where about 
the Cape de Verd^ in hopes to meet iome European 
fhip. If Providence did not fo favour, my next 
courfe was to feek for the iflands, or lofe my life 
among the Negroes. And, in a word, I put my 
whole ftrefs upon this, either that I muji meet with 
femejhipy or certainly per ijh. 

But, as we were failing along, we law people 
ftand on the Ihore to look at us ; we could alfo per- 
ceive they were black ai)d ftark naked. I was in- 
clined to go on Ihore j but Xury cried, No^ no 5 
however, I approached nearer, and I found they 
run along the more by ipe a good vmy : They had 
no weapons in their hands, except one, who held a 
long ftick, which Xury told me was a lance, with 
which they could kill at a great diftance. I talked 
to them by figns, and made them fenfible I wanted 
fomething to, eat ; They beckoned to me to ftop my 
boat i while two of them run up into the country, 
and in lefs than half an hour came back and brougnt 
with them two pieces of dry flefh, and fbme corn, 
which we kindly accepted ; and to prevent any fears 
of either fide, they brought the food to the (bore, laid 
it down, then went and Iteod a great way off, till we 
fetched it on board, and then came clofe to us again. 

But while we were returning thanks to them, be- 
ing all we could offer, two mighty creatures came 

from 



t >9 1 
from the mountains, one as it were ptufuing the 
>tlier with great fiuy, which we were inclined to 
believe, becaufe they feldom appear but in the night; 
uid both thefe fwiftly paffing by the Ni^grois^ jumptd 
into the fea, wantonly fwimmmg about, as though 
die diverfion of the waters had put a ftop to their 
Eercenefs. At laft, one of them coming nearer my 
boat than I expelled or defired, I (hot him directly 
through the head ; upon which he funk immediatelv. 

Set riung again, would have willingly made to tne 
lore ; but l>etween the wound and the ftrangling of 
the water, he died before he could reach it. 

It is not poflible for me to exprefs the confterna- 
tion the poor Negroes were in at the firing my gun ; 
much lefs can I mention their furprife, when they 
perceived the creature to be flain by it. I made figns 
to them to draw near it, and then gave them a rope 
to hale it on (hore. It was a beautiful leopaniy 
which made me dcfire its fkin ; and the Negroes 
feeming to covet the carcafe, I ver^ freel v gave it to 
them. As for the other leopard, it made to (hore, 
and ran with a prodigious fwiftnefs out of fight. 
The Negroes having kindly fumifhed me with water 
and with whatYoots and grain their country afforded, 
I took my leave, and after eleven days fail," I came 
in fight of the Cape di Verd^ and thole iflands called 
by its name. But the great diftance I was from 
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my 
reachine either of them, lerew melancholy and 
deJeAed; when, on a fudden, Xury cried out, 
Mqfiery Majier^ a /hip with a fail ; and looked fo 
frightened, as if it was his matter's (hip fent in 
fearch of us : But I foon difcovered fhe was a Per-* 
tugueze (hip, and, as I thought, bound to the coafl 
of Guinea^ for Negroes. Upon which I ftrove for 
life to come up to them ; but vain had it been, if, 
dirough their perfpe£live glaflfes, they had not percei** 
ved me, and ihortencd their fail tQ let mc come up. 

Encouraged 



Encouraged at tbis^ I fet up my patron's antient, 
and fired a gun, both as fignals of diftrefs ; upon 
which they very kindly lay to; fo that in three hours 
time I came up with them. They fpoke to me lA 
Portujujfi^ Spanijby and French^ but neither of theft 
did I underftand ; till at length a Scats fatlor called, 
and then I told him I was an EngUJhman^ who had 
efcaped from the Misrs of SalUe \ upon which they 
look me kindly on board, with all my efFeJls. - 

Surely none can exprefs that inconceivable joy mj 
heart felt at this my happy deliverance ; who, frond 
being a miferable an<l forlorn creature, was not only * 
relieved, but in favour with the mafter of the &ip, 
whom in return for my deliverance I offered all I had 
to him ; God frrhid^ faid he, that I JhoM take anj 
thing from you^ eir^ty thing Jhall he delivered to you when 
you come to Brafil ; If I have faved your life^ it it m 
more than I Jhould expe6t to receive myfelf from an) 
mher^ when in the fame circumftances^ I foould hapfeh 
U meet the like deliverance ; andjhould I take from you 
what ysu have^ and have you at Brafil, why this 
would Be only taking away a life I have given ; my cba* 
rity teaches me better ; thofe effeffs you have willfupport 
you there J and provide you a paffage home again. And 
indeed he aftcd with the ih-i«dt juflice in what he 
did, taking my things into his pofleifion; and ^- 
▼ing me an exa<5l inventory, even to 'my earthen jarsi 
He bought my boat of me for the (hip's ufe, giving 
me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Bra-^ 
filj and if any body offered more he would make it 
up. He alfo gave me fixty pieces for my boy Xuryi 
It was with ^reat reluctance I was prevailed upon to 
fell the child^s liberty, who had fcrved me fo faith- 
fully ; but the boy himfelf was willing, and it was 
agreed, that after ten yfear^, he fhouI<rbe made free, 
upon his renouncing Malxmetanifm and embracing 
ehriftianity. 

Having a pleaf^t voyage to the Brajils^ wc ar- 
rived 



rived in the Bay de Todos los Sant9Sj or jmSainis Bay^ 
in about 22 days after. And here I cannot forget 
the generous treatment of the captain; he would 
take nothing for my pafiage, nveme 20 ducats for 
the leopard's (kin, and 30 for die lion's : Every thing 
he caufed to be delivered ; and what I would fell he 
bought. In fhorty I made about 220 pieces of my 
cargo, and with this ftock I entered once more, as I 
may fay, into thefam •flift. 

Being recommended to an honeft planter, I lived 
with him till fuch time as I was informed of the man- 
ner of their planting and making fugar ; and feeing 
bow well they lived, and how fuddenly they Rrew 
rich, I was filled with an emulation, at leaft, to fettle 
among them, refolving to get my money remitted to 
me, and to purchafe me a plantation. 

To be brief, I bought a fettlement next door to an 
honeft and kind neighbour, born at LiJboHj of EngUJh 
parents, whofe plantation joining to mine, we im- 
proved it very amicable together : Both our ftockt 
were low, and for two years we planted only for 
food : But the third year we planted fome tobacco, 
preparing each a large piece of ground for planting 
canes the enfuing year ; but now wanting affiftance, 
I repented the lofs of my dear boy Xury. 

Here having none to aflift me, my father's words 
came asain into my mind ; and if only a middle fta- 
tion of life I fought, why could it not as well be 
obtained in England as here f When I pondered of 
this with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance 
forfook me ; 1 had none to converfe with but my 
neighbour; no work to be done but by my -own 
hands ; and this often made me fay, my condition 
was like that of a man caft upon a defolate i(land« 
So unhappy are we in our refli £lions, fo fomtful 
wh^t eood things we receive ourfelves, and io un- 
thankrul for our deliverance from thofe calamities 
that others endursi .

of cruel Savages^ or the paws of devouring beafts of 
prev. 

In this great diftrefs, one of our men, early in die 
morning, cried out, Land^ Land! when no fooner 
looking out, but our (hip ftruck upon a fand, and in 
a moment the fea broke over in fuch a manner^ that 
we expeAed we (hould all have periihed .immediately. 
We knew nothing where we were, or upon what 
land we were driven ; whether an ifland or the main; 
inhabited or not inhabited ; and we could not fo 
much as hope that the (hip would hold many mi- 
nutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind, 
by a miracle, fhould turn about immediately. While 
we flood looking at one another, expelling death 
every moment, the mate laid hold of the boat,* and, 
with the help of the reft, got her flung over tht 
ihip's iide, and getting all into her, being eleven of 
us, committed ourfelves to God's mercy, and the 
wild fea. And now we faw that this laft effort would 
not be a fufficient protection from death ; fo high did 
the fea run, that it was impoffible the boat fiiould 
live. As to making fail, we had none ; neither, 
if we had, could we make ufe of any. So that when 
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league 
and a half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain, 
came rowling aftern of us, and took us with fuch 
fury, that at on^e it overfet the boat. Thus being 
fwallowed up in a moment, \^e had hardly time to 
call upon the tremendous name of God ; much left 
to implore, in dying ejaibulations, his infinite mercy, 
to receive our departing fouls. 

Men are generally counted infenfible, when ftrug- 
gling in the pangs of death ; but while I was over- 
whelmed with uater, I had the moft dreadful appre* 
henfions imaginable ; for the joys o£ heaven, and 
torments of hell, feemed to prelent themfelves before 
me in thefe dying a- onies, and even in the fmall fpace 
of time, as it were, between life and death. I was 

going. 



r 25 ]. 

going, I thought, I knew not whither, in a difmal 
gulf unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to be- 
hold my friends, nor the light of this world any 
more ! Could I even have thou ^ht annihilation, or 
a total diiTolution of foul as well as body, the gloomy 
thoughts of having no further being, no knowledge 
of what we hoped for, but an eternal quietus, with- 
out life or fenfe; even that, I fay, would have been 
enough to ftrike me with horror and confufion ! But 
ftriving to the laft extremity, while I thoueht all my 
companions were overpowered and entombed in the 
deep, it was with great difficulty I kept my breath 
till the wave fpient itfelf, and retiring back, left me 
on the ihore half dead with the water I had taken in. 
However, I got on my feet as faft as I could, left 
another wave fhould purfue, and carry me back 
jagain ; but for all the hafte I made, I could not 
avoid it ; for the fea came after me like a high 
mountain, or furious enemy, fo that my bufmcfs was 
to hold my breath, and by raifmg myfclf on the 
water, prelerve it by fwimming ; the next drcadfuj 
wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep, 
but at the fame time carried me with a mighty force 
and fwiftnefs towards the fhorc j when raifing niy- 
felf, I held out as well as poffible, 'till at Icngtli the 
water having fpent itfelf, began to return, at which 
I ftruck forward, and feeling ground with my feet, 
I took to my heels again; thus befng fcrved twice 
more, I was at laft daihed againft a piece of a rock, 
in fuch a manner as left me fenfelefs ; but recovering 
a little before the return of the waves, which, no 
doubt, then would have overwhelmed me, I held 
faft by the rock till thofe fucceeding waves abated ; 
and then, fetching another run, was overtook bv a 
fmall wave, which was foon conquered ; but before 
any more could overtake me, I reached the main 
land, where clambering up the clifts of die fhore, 
tired and almoft fpent, 1 fat down on the grafs, free 
from the dangers of the foaming ocean.

[ 26 ] 

No tongue can exprefs the ccftafies and tranfporti 
that my foul fdt at this happy deliveraiYce, it wai 
like a reprieve to a dving malefador, with the halttf 
about his neck, and ready to be turned off. I was 
wrapt up in contemplation, and often lifted up mj 
hands, with the profoundeft humility, to the divint 
Powers, for faving my life, when the reft of my 
companions were all drowned. And now I began 
to caft my eyes around, to behold what place I VfU 
in, and what I had next to do. I cculd fee no 
houfe, nor people : I was wet, yet had no clothes to 
fliift me ; hungry and thirfty, 'yet nothing to eat or 
drink ; no weapon to deftroy any creature for my 
fufenance, nor defend myfelf Igainft devouring 
beafts : In fbort, I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco- 
pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The dark- 
feme night coming upon me, increafed my fears of 
being devoured by wild creatures j my mind was 
plunged in defpair ; and, having no profpeft, as I 
thought, of life before me, prepared for ahother 
kind of death than what I had lately efcaped. I 
walked about a furlong to fee if I could find any frcfli 
water, which 1 did to my ereat joy, and taking a 
quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up into a 
thick bufhytrcc, and feating myfelf fo that! could 
not full, a deep flcep overtook me, and for that nigbt 
buried my Ibrrcv/s in a quiet repofe. 

It was broad dzy the next morning before I awa- 
ked ; when not only I perceived the tempeft was 
ceafed, but the {hip was driven almoft as far as the 
rock beforenicntioned, where the waves had dafhed 
me againft, and which was about a mile from the 
place where I was. When I came down from my 
apartment in the tree, I perceived the ihip's boat 
two miles diftant on my right hand, lying on fbore, 
as the waves had caft her. I thought to have got to 
her, but there being an inlet of water of about half 
a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned again 

towards 



t 27 ] 
towards the fliip, as hoping to findiomething; for my'' 
more immediate fubfiftance. About noon, when tlic 
fca was calm, that I could come within u quarter of 
a mile of her, it was to my grief I perceived that if 
we had kept on board, all our lives had luvn faved. 
Thcfe thoughts, and. my folitude, drew tcjirs from 
my eyes, though all in vain. So rcfolvin;^ to yji to 
the fnip, I ftript, and leapt into the water ; wh ii 
fwimming round her, I was afraid I (hould not get 
any thing to lay hold of ; but it was my good for- 
tune to cfpy a fmall piece of rope hana: do ah by the 
fore-chains fo low, that with trrcat dilliculty, by the 
help of it, I eot into the forecaCtIc of the ihip. 
Here I found that the iliip was bulged, and h;;'J a 
great deal of water in her hold ; her item was liucd 
up. againft a bank, and her head almofi: in the wa- 
ter : All hsr quarter, and what was there, were free 
and dry. The provilions I found in good order, 
with wnich I crammed my pockets ; and, lofm^ no 
time, eat while 1 was doing other things ; I alfo 
found fome rum, of which I took a heiirty dram ; 
and now I wanted for nothing except a boat, which 
indeed was all, to carry away what was needful for 

me. 

Neceffity occafions quickncfs of thought. We 
had feveral ipare yards, a fpare topmaft or two, and 
two or three large fpars of wood: With thcfe I fell 
to work, and flung as many of them overboard as I 
could manage, tying every one of them with a rope 
that they might not drive away. This done, I went 
down the fhip's fide, and tieafourof them fj{^ to- 
gether at both ends, in form of a raft, arid laying 
two or three (hort pieces of plank upon them, crofs- 
ways, I found it would bear me, but not any confi- 
derable weight. Upon which I went to work aeain, 
cutting a fpare topmaft into three lengths, adding 
them to my raft with a great deal of labour and 
pains. I then confidered what I flxould load it with, 
C 2 it 



[ 28 I 

irbeing not able to bear a ponderous burden. ' And 
this I foon thought of, firft laying upon it all the 
pknks and boards I could get 5 next I lowered down 
three of the feamens chefts, after I had filled them 
with bread, rice, three Dutch cheefes, five pieces 
of dried goat's flefh, and fome European corn, what 
little the rats had fpared 4 but for the liquors, 

- I found jfeveral cafes of bottles belonging to our 
ikipper. In which were fome Cordial waters, and 
four or five gallons of rack, which I flowed by them- 
felves; By this time the tide beginning to flow, I 
perceived my coat, waiftcoat, andftiirt, fwim away, 
which I had left on the fhore j as for my" linen 
breeches and ftockings, I fwam with them on to- 
ihip : But I foon found clothes enqugh, yet took 
no more than I wianted for the prefent. My eyes 
were chiefly on tools to work with ; and after 
long fearch I found out the carpenter's cheft, 
which I got fafe down on my raft: Then I looked 
for arms and ammunition, and, in the great cabin,' 

• found two good fowling-pieces, two piftols, fevepl 
powder-horns filled, a fmall bag of fhot, and p9¥0 
rufty old fwords. I alfo found three barrels of pow- 
der, two of which were good, but the third had 
taken water ; with two or three broken oars, two 
faws, an axe, and a hammer, I put to fea^ and in 
getting tp jfhore, I had three encouragements ; i , A 
unooth calm fea. 2. The tide rifing and fetting in* 
to the fliore. 3. The little wind there was blew to- 
wards Jand. But after I had failed about a mile^ I 
found the raft to drive a little diftancc from the place 
where I firft landed ; and then I perceived a little 
opening of the land, with a ftrong current of the tide 
•running into it, upon which I kept in the middle of 
the ftream : But great was my concern, when on a- 
fudden the fore^part of my raft run aground j fo that . 
had I not with great difliculty, for near half an hour," 

kept 



[ 29 ] 
cept my back ftraining againft the cheds, to keep my 
iffeiks in their places, all I had would have eoiie 
nto the fca. Btit after fomc time, the rifmg ot the 
¥3ter caufed the raft to float again, when coming up 
I little river, with land on both fides, I landed in a 
little Cove, as near the mouth as p >ilib!e, the better 
to difcover a fail, if any fuch providentially paffcd 
by that way. 

Not far offy I ipied a hill of a ftupendous hcio;hth, 
furrounded with lefler hills about it : and thither [ 
ivas refolved to go and view the country, that I 
night fee what part was the bcfl place to fix my 
habitation in : Accordingly, arming myfclf with a 
piftol, a fowling-piece, powder, and ball, I afccnd- 
ed the mountain : There I perceived I was in an 
iiland encompailed by the fea ; no diftant lands to be 
feen, but fcattering rocks that lay to the weft ; that 
it feemed a barren place, and, as I thought, inha- 
bited only by wild beafts. I perceived abundance of 
fowls, but Ignorant of what kind, or whether good 
for nourifhment j I fhot one of them at my return, 
which occafioned a confufed fcreaming among the 
other birds ; and I found it, by its colour andbcnk, 
to be a kind of hawk, but its flcfh was perfect 
carrion. 

When I came to my raft, I brought my efFcfts on 
(hore, which work Ipent that day cntuely; and 
fearing that fome cruel beafts might devour me in the 
night while I flept, I made a kmd of a hut or bar- 
ricade with the chefts and boards I brought from 
(hore. That night I flept very comfortably, and the 
next morning my thoughts were employed to make a 
further attempt on the fhip, and bring away what 
neceflaries I could find, before another ftorm fhouUl 
break her to-pieces. Accordingly I got on board as 
before, and prepared a fecond raft, far more nice 
than the firft ; upon which I brought away the car- 
penter's ftores, two or three bags full of nails, a

The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces, 
carried t)ff a haulfer whole, with a ereat deal of iron^ 
MTork, and made another raft with the mizen and 
Tprit-fail yards, but this being fo unweildy, by the 
too heavy burden I had upon it, and not being able 
iextrouily to guide it as the former^ both my cai^ 
and I were overturned* For my part, ail the da^ 
mage I fuftained was a wet (kin i and at low water^ 
Kfier much labour in diving, I got moft of the ca- 
bles, and fome pieces of iron. 

Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and 
eleven times on boani, bringing away all that was 
poffible i though, I believe, had the weather been 
calm, I fhould have brought away the whole fhip, 
piece by piece. As I was going the twelfth time, 
the wind began to rife, howevcf, I ventured at low 
water, and rummaging; the cabin efFe^hially, in a 
locker I found feveraJ razors, fcifiers, and fome 
dozens of knives and forks ; and in another thirty- 
fix pounds in pieces of eight, filver, and gold. Mf 
(pnple vanity^ faid I, whom this world fo much doat$ 
ott^ where is miv thy virtue j. thy excellency to mef You 
cannot procure me one thing needful^ nor remove me from 
this defolate ifland to a place of plenty : One of thefe 
knives^ fo meanly efleemed^ is to me more preferable than 
all this leap. E'en therefore remain where thou arty to 
fink in the deepj as unregarded^ even as a creature whofe 
life is not worth preferving< Yet after all this excla- 
mation, I wrapt it up in a piece of canvas, and be- 
gan to think of making another raft ; but foon I 
perceived the wind began to rife, a freih jgale blow- 
ing from the (here, and the (ky ovcrcaft with clouds 
and darknefs. So thinking a raft to be in vain, I let 
myfeif into the water with what things I had about 
me, and it was with much difficulty I got afhore, 
when foon after it blew a fearful ftorm. 

■That night I flcpt very contentedly in my little 
tent, furrounded with all my effects 3 but when I 

Jooked 



C . 32 -1 
looked out in the morning, no more (hip was tolx 
feen. This much furprized me for the prefent^ yet 
when I confidered I had loll no time, abated no pains, 
and had got every thing ufeful out of hcr> I com- 
forted myfelf in the be5 manner, and entirely fub- 
mitted to the will of Providence. 

My next thoughts were, how I ftiould defend 
and tecure myfelf from favages^ and wild beafts, if 
aoy fuch were in the ifland. At one time I thought 
of digging a cave ; at another, I vras for erefting 
a tent ; and, in fliort, I refolved to do both : The 
manner or form of which will not, I hope^ be un- 
pieafmg to defcribe. 

When I confidered the ground where I was ; that 
It was moori/h, and had no frefli water near it ; mv 
refoluttons were to fearch for a foil healthy and well 
watered, where I might not only h% fheltered from 
the fun's, fcorching heat, but be more conveniently 
fituated, as well to be fccured from wild men and 
beafts of prey, as more eafily to difcover any diftant 
fail, fhould it ever fo happen. 

And indeed it was not long befbre I' had my de* 
Are, I found a little plain near a rifing hill, -the 
front towards which being as .fteep as a houfe-fide 
nothing could defcend on me from the top. On the 
fide of this rock was a little hollovv place, refem- 
bling the entrance or door of a cave. • Juft before 
this place, on the circle of the green, I refolved my 
tent fhould ftand. This plain did not much ex- 
ceed ICO yards broad, and about twice as long, like 
a delightful green b^re my door, with a pleafing, 
though irregular defcent every way to the low 
grounds by the fea-fide, lying on the N. N. W. fide 
of the hill, fo that it was fheltered from the excef- 
five heat of the fun. After this I drew a femi- 
circle, containing ten yards in its femi-diameter, 
and twen^ yards^ in the whole, driving down two 
rows of fbrong flakes, not fix inches from each 

other^ 



[ 33 ] 
Other. Then with the pieces of cable which I had 
cut on board, I regularly laid them in the circle bc-> 
tween the piles up to their tops, which were more 
than five feet out of the earth, and after drove an- 
other row of piles looking within-fide ac;ainft them, 
between two or three feet high, which made me 
conclude it a little impregnable caftle, from men and 
beafts : And for my better fecurity, I would have no 
door, but entered m and came out by the help of a 
ladder, which I alfo made. 

Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I 
carried all my riches, ammunition and ftores. Af-' 
ter which, working on the rock, what with the dirt 
and fiones I dug out, I not only raifed my ground 
two feet, but made a little cellar to my manfion- 
houfe ; and this coft me many days labour and pains. 
But one day in particular a fhower of rain falling, 
thunder and lightning enfucd, which put me in ter- 
ror, left my powder fhould take fire, and not onlv 
hinder my ncccffary fubfiftance from killing me foocf, 
but even blow up me and my habitation : To pre- 
vent which, I fell to making ooxes and bags, in or- 
der to fcparate it, having by me near 150 v/cight. 
And thus being eftablifhed as kin^ of the ifland, 
every day I went out with my gun to lee what I could 
kill that was fit to eat. I foon perceived numbers 
of goats, but very fliy : Yet having watched them 
narrowly, and feeing I could better fhoot off the 
rocks than when in the low ground?, I one day hap- 
pened to (hoot a ihe-goat fuckling a young kid ; who 
not thinking its dam flain, ftood by her unconcerned ; 
and when I took the dead creature up, the young 
one followed me even to the inclofure. I lifted the 
kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it 
alive $ but finding it could not be brought to eat, I 
was forced to flay it alfo for my own fubfiftance. 

Thus entered into a ftrange fcene of life, as ever 
any msui was in, I bad moft melancholy apprehcn- 

fio()s 



[ 34 ] ; 

fions concerning my deplorabk condition ; and many 
times the tears would plentifully run down my face^ 
when I confidered how I was debarred from all com- 
Oiunication with human-kind. And while fome 
defponding cogitations \youId feem to make me ac- 
cufe Providence, other good thoughts would interppfe 
and reprove, after this manner : Well> fuppofing 
jou are defolate, is it not better to be fo, than to- 
tally perifli ? Why were you fingled out to be faved, 
and the 1^ deftroyed ? Why fhould vou complain, 
when not only your life is preferved, but the fliip 
driven even into your reach, in order to take what 
was neceffary out of her for your fubfiftance ? But to 
proceed. It was, by the account I kept, the 30th of 
SepUmher^ when I firft landed on this 'ifland : ASout 
twelve days after, fearing I fhould lofe my reckon- 
ing of time, nay even forget the Sabhath-'days^ for 
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved it with a 
knife upon a large poft, in great letters, and fetting 
it up, in the fimilitude of a crofs, on the fea-fhore 
v/here I landed, viz. I came on Jhore^ Sept, 30, 1 659. 
Every day I cut a notch with my knife on the fides 
of this fquare poft, and that on Sabbath was as' long 
again as the reft j and every day of the month as 
long again as that long one : In this manner I kept 
my kalendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckon- 
ing of time. But had I made a more ftrift fearch 
(as I did afterwards) I need not have fet up this 
mark : For among the parcels belonging to the gun- 
ner, carpenter, and captain's mate, thofe very things . 
I wanted I found, particularly pens, ink, and paper ; 
alfo two or three compaffes, fome mathematical in- 
ftruments, dials, profpeitive, books of navigation, 
three Englijh Bibles, and feveral other good books, 
which I carefully put up. But here I cannot but 
call to mind our having a dog and two cats on board, 
whom I imade inhabitants with me in my cattle, 
*" though ^one migljt think I had aU»the neceflaries 



r\' 



i 3S] 
Bis were defirable, yet ftill I found reverai things want- 
ing. My ink was daily wafting ; I wanted needles, 
pins, and thread, to mend or keep my clothes to« 
gether; particularly a fpade, pick-axe, or fhovcl, 
to remove the earth : It was a year before I finiflied 
my little bulwark j| and having fomc intervals of re- 
laxation, after my daily wandering abroad for pro- 
viflon, 1 drew up this plan alternately, as creditor 
and debtor, to remind me of the mifcries and bleflings 
of my life, under fo many various circumftances.

And now eafing my mind a little by thefc reflec- 
tions, I began to render mv life as eafy as poffiblc. 
I muft here add, to the defcription I have ^iven of 
my habitation, that haying raifed a turf wall againfl 
the outfide of it, 1 thatched it fo clofe, as might keep 
it from the inclemency of the weather. I alfo im-; 
proved it within, enlarged my cave, and made a paf- 
fage and door in the rock, which came out beyond 
the pale of my fortification. I next proceeded to 
make a chair and table, and fo began to ftudjjfiflbfe 
mechanical arts that feemed to me prafticable ; For 
when I wanted a plank or board, 1 hewed down a 
tree with my hatchet, making it as thin with my 
axe as poffible, and then fmooth enough with my 
adze to anfwer my defigns \ yet this way could { 
make no more than one board out of a tree : But in 
length of time, I got boards enough to ihelter all 
my ftorcs, every thing being regularly placed, and 
my guns fecurely hanging againft the fide of the 
rock. All this made it a very pleafant fight to me, 
being the refult of vaft labour and diligence j which 
leaving for a while, and me to the enjoyment of, I 
fhall give the reader an account of my Journal- from 
the day of my landing, till the fixing and fettling of 
my habitation, as heretofore fhewn. 

JOURNAL. 

Septemher 30, 1659. I unhappy Rohinfon Crufoi^ 
having fufFered fliipwreck, was driven on this defol- 
iate ifland, which i named the Defolate I/land ofDe- 
fpair^ the reft being fwallowed up in the tempef- 
tuou9 ocean. The next day 1 fpent in confideration 
of my unhappy circumftances, having no prolpeft, 

but 



[ 37 ] 

but of death, cither to be ftarved with hunger, or 
devoured by bcafts or mercilefs favages. 

O£fob. I. That morning, with great comfort, I 
beheld the fhip drove afhorc. Some hopes I had, 
that when the ftorm was abated, I might be able to 
get fome food and neceilaries out of her ; which I 
conceived wore not damaged, becaufe the (hip did 
ftand upright. At this tyne I lamented the lofs of 
my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the 
vefTel. When I perceived the fhip, as it were, lie 
dry, I waded through the fands, then fwam aboard, 
the weather being very rainy, and with fcarcely any 
Wind. 

-^To the 24th of this month, my time was cm- 
ployed in making voyages, every tide getting what 
1 could out of the (hip. The weather very wet and 
uri<;ertain. 

O^oB. 20. My raft, and all the goods thereon, 
were overfet; yet I recovered moft again at low 
water. 

O^oB. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and 
day, when the (hip diiTolved in pieces, fo that no- 
thing was feen of her but the wreck at low water. 
This day I fecured my goods from the inclemency 
of the weather. 

O^oB. 26. I wandered to fee where I could find a 
place* convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock 
m the evening, marked out a half-moon, intending 
to ere£l a wall, fortified with piles, lined within 
with pieces of cables, and covered with turf. 

Nov. 1. 1 erefted my tent under a rock ; and took 
up my lodging very contentedly in a hammock that 
night. 

Ndv. 2. This day I fenced myfelf in with timber, 
ch'cfb, and boards. 

Nov. 3. 1 (hot two wild fowl, refembling ducks, 
which were good to' eat i and in the afternoon made 
me a table.

AT;!'. 4- I began to live rpgiilarly ; In the morn^ 
ing, . ailov.x J ciyilif two or thre j hours to walk out 
with my Lun ; then work t-II near ii oVIock: end 
after rcfrdh myfcif wsth what I had to eat. From 
12 to 2 1 would lie down to fleep. Extreme fultry 
weather : in the evening go to work again. 

X'cv. 5. AV'cnt out V ith my gun and dog, ihot a 
wild cat with a foft (kin, but hcr^cfh was good for 
nothin^^ The Ikins of thofe I killed I prcferved. 
In my .rttuni Ipcrceucd many wild birds, and was 
terrified by feme Icals, which made off to fea. 

Ncv. 6. Completed my table. 

N(^\ 7. Fair weather. I uorked till the 12th, 
but omitted the nth, which, jiccordlng to my cal- 
culation, I fuppofcd to be Sunday. 

Nsv, 1 3. Rain in abundance, which however much 
cooled the earth, when thunder and lightning cau- 
fed in me a terrible furprize. The weather cloiring, 
in feparate parcels I fecured my powder. 

Ncv. 14 to 16. I made little boxes for my pow- 
der, lodging them in federal places. I alfbfliota 
large fowl, which proved excellent meat. 

Nov. I?- I began to dig in the rock, yet was obli- 
ged todcmlforwantofa pick-axe, fhovel, and wheel- 
barrow. Iron, crows I caufed to fupply the place of the 
firft, but with all my artcouldnot make a wheelbarrow. 

Nov. i8. It was my fortune to find a tree, rc- 
fembling what the Brajilians call an iron tree. I h^ 
like to have fpoiled my axe with cutting it, being very 
hard and- exceeding heavy 5 yet with much labour 
and induftry I mace a fort of a fpade out of it. 

Nozf. 23. Thefe tools being made, I daily carried 
on my buluicfs, eighteen days I allowed for enlar- 
ging my cave, that it might ferve me not only for a 
warchoufc, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar.. I 
commonly lay in the tent unlefs the weather was 
rainy that I could not lie dry. So wet would it be at 
certain fcafons, that I was obliged to cover all within 

the 



[ 39 T 
Ae paTe with long poles in the form of rafters lean- 
ing asainft the rock, and load them with flags an<f 
largeleaves of trees refembling a thatch. 

Dec. 10. No foonerdid I tnink my. habitation fi* 
nifhed, but fuddenly a great deal of the top broke io^' 
to that it was a mercy 1 was not buried in the rutJM. 
This occafiofied a ereat deal of pains and trouble to- 
me, before I could make it firm and durable.. 

D^c. 17. I nailed up fome Ihelvcs, and drove nails- ^ 
and'ftaples in the wall and pofts to hang things out 
of the way. 

Dec. 20. EVery thing I got into its place, then 
made a fort of a drefler, and another tabic. 
. Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance* 

Dec. 26. Very fair weather. 

Dec. 27. I chanced to light on fome goats, (hot 
one, wounded another. I led it home in a firing, 
bound up his leg, and cured it in a little time ; at 
length it became fo tame and familiar, as to feed be- 
fore the door, and follow me where I pleafed. This 
put me in mind to bring up tame creatures, in order 
to fupply me with food after my ammunition was 
Ipent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exccilive hot, 
with little air, obliged me for the moft part to keep 
within doors. 

Jim. !• Still fultiy. However, obliged by no* 
cemty, I went out with my gun, and found a great 
ftore 6! goats in the vallies ; they were exce^ing 
fliy, nor could my dog hunt them down. 

Jan. 3, to 14. My employment thi^ time was to 
finifh the wall before defcribed, and fearch the ifland. 
I difcovered a kind of pigeons like our houfe pi' 
geons, in a neft among the rocks : I brought them 
Some, nurs'd them till they could flv, and then they 
]eft me. After this I (hot fome wnich proved ex- 
cellent food. Some time I fpent vainly in contriving 
to make a ca& \ I may well fay it was vain, becauie 
D 2 I could 



, E 40 ] 

I could neither Join the ftave^, or fix the heads, &» 
as to make it tight. Then taking fome goat's tallow 
I had by me, and a little dkum for the wick, I pro- 
vided myfelf with a lamp, which ferved me'inftead 
of candles. 

But now a very ftrange event happened : For being 
in the height of my fearch, whatfhould come into 
my hand, but a bag, v<hich was ufed to hold corn 
(as I fuppofed) for the fowk : So immediately re- 
folvingtoput gunpowder in it, I ihook all the htilks 
and dirt upon one fide of the rock, little fufpedina 
what the confequencfe would be. The rain had 
fallen plentifully a few days before \ and about \ 
month after, to my great amazement, fomethingbe- 

fan to fpout out very green and flourifhing : And when 
came to view it more nicely, every day, as it grew, 
I found about lo or 12 ears of gree' barley appeared^ 
ki the very fame fhape and make as that in England. 
. I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at 
this fight. Hitherto I had looked upon the aftions^ 
©f this life, no otherwife than only as the events of 
blind chance and fortune : But now, the appearance 
of this barley, flouriflnng in a barren foil to the fort 
©f grain, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it 
fliould come there, made me conclude that mirpidt^ 
were not yet ceafed: Nay, I even thought that Gq4 
had appomted it to grow there without any feed, pure- 
ly for my fuftenance in this miferable and dcJblat^ 
iiland. And indeed fuch great eftcdt had this upcn me. 
that it often made me melt into tears, thro' a grateful 
fcnfe of God's mercies ; and the greater ftill was my 
thankfulncfs, when I perceived about this little fielA 
of barley feme rice italks, wonderfully flourilhing ii| 
proportion to the crop within. 

While I was thus wonderfully pleafed in mind, I 
concluded there mult be more corn in the ifland % ' 
and therefore made a diligent fearch narrowly among 
the rocks;, but CQuld not find any i when upon 4 

iudden 



I 41 I 

iudden !t came into my mind, how I had fhnlcpn the 
hufks of corn out of the bag, and then my tidmiration 
ceafed, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as 
thinking it was hut natural^ and not to be conceived 
a miracle ; though even the manner of its prcfcrva- 
tion mi^ht have made me own it as a wonderful 
event ot God's kind Providence. 

It was about the latter end of June when the ears 
of this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, 
together with 20 or 30 ihdks of rice, exposing one 
day I ihould reap the fruit of my labour ; vet four 
years were expired before I could allow myfolf to eat 
any barley bread, and much Ioniser time before I had 
any rice. After this, with indefatigable pains and 
inauftry for three or four months, at laft I finifhcd 
my wall on the i4.th oi Aprils having no way to go 
into it, but by a ladder again^ the wall. 

April lb. I finifhcd my ladder, and afccndcd !t ; 
after pulled it up, then let it down on the other ftde, 
and dcfccnded into my new habitation, where I had 
fpace enough, and fo fortified that nothing could at- 
tack me without fcaling the walls. 

But what docs all human pains and indudry avai], 
if the blcffings of God do not crown our hibours \ 
Or, who can ftand before the Almighty, wiien he 
ftretcheth forth his arm : For one time, as I was at 
the entrance of my cave, there happened fuch a 
dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of the 
cave came crumbling about my cars, but the pofts 
feemed to crack terriUy at the fame time. This made 
me, in great amazen^ent, run to my ladder and gtt 
over the wall : When there I plainly knew it was an 
earthquake, the place 1 ftood on fuiluining three 
terrible fhocks in Icfs than three minutes. And whe>n 
I (zyr the top of a great rock rowl into the fea, then 
I expeAed the^ifland would be (Viillowed up every 
moment : And dreadful it was to fee the fea thrown

into the moft violent agitations and dii<M:ders hf this 
tremendous accident. 

For my part, I ftood like acriminal, at the pkce 
of execution, ready to expire, * At the moving of the 
earth, I was, as it were, fea-fick; f(nd very much 
afraid left the rock, under which was my fence and 
habitation fhould overwhelm ixie and it in a lafting 
.-tomb. ' 

When the third dreadful fhock had fpent 5tfelf> 
my fpiritsbegan to revive ; yet ftill . I would not 
•venture to afcend the ladder, but continued fittings 
not kno^^^ng what I fhould do. So little grace then 
J had, only to fay, Lordy have mercy upon me! and 
no fooner was the earthquake over, but that pathetic 
prayer left me. 

It was not long after when a horribk tempeft 
arofe, at the fame time attended with a hurricane of 
wind. The fea feemed mountains high, and the 
waves rolled fo impetuoufly, that nothing could fep 
perceived but froth and foani. Three hours did this 
ftorni continue, and in fo violent a manner as to tW 
the very trees up by the roots, which was iucceeded 
by abundance of rain. When this.was over I went 
to my tent, but the rain coming again upon me in a 
furious manner, obliged me to take*fht:lter in the 
cave 5 and then I was forced to cut a channel thro' 
my fortification to let the water out. It continued 
raining all that night, and fome time the next day : 
Yet no fooner did the weather clear up, but Ireful- 
ved to build me a little hut in fome open place, wall-d 
round, to defend me from wild creatures and favages, 
as not thinking but at the next earthquake the moun- 
tain would fall upon my habitation and me, and 
fwallow up all in its bowels. 

April 19, 20. Thefedays i fpent in contriving how 
and in what manner I fhould fix my place of abode : ' 
All this while I was under the mofi dreadful ap- 
. -prehenfions. When I looked round my habitation, 

every

every thing I found in its proper place. I had Csverai 
rcfolutions whether 1 fhpulJ move or not. At 
length I refolved to ftay ^^here 1 v^as till had found 
a convenient place where I might piich my tent. 

Apr. 22. When I began to pat my rcfolutions in 
praiEtice, I was ftopt for want of tools and inttrw- 
meats to work with. Moft of my axes and hatchets 
were ufclefs, occafioned by cutting the hard timber 
that grew on the ifland. it took me up a full week 
to make my grindftone of ufe to me, and at laft I 
found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by 
the help of a wheel and a firing. 

Apr. 28, 29. Tht(fi days were fpent in grinding 
my tools. 

Apr. 30. My bread falling Ihort, I allowed m]ry 
felf out oiie bifcuit a-day. 

May I. As I walked alon^ the fea-(hore, I found 
a barrel of gunpowder, and fcveral pieces of the 
wreck, whic'h the fea had flung up. Having fccured 
thofe, I made to the (hip, whofe ftern was torn off, 
and waflicd a great diftance afhore ; but the reft lay 
in the fand^, This, I fuppofed, was occafioned by 
tlie earthquake. Now I refolved .to keep my olu 
place of abode ; and alfo to go to the (hip that day, 
but found it impo/Hblc. 

A£iy j. I went on board, and with my fav/ faw'd 
off* one of the beams which kept her quart€;r-deck ; 
then I cleared the fand till flood. 

May 4., I caught fome fifh, but they were not 
wholefome. The iame day 1 alfo catched a young 
dolphin. 

May 5. This day I alfo repaired to the wreck, 
and faw'd another piece of timber : and when the 
flood came, I made a float of three grc^t plank^, 
which was driven afhore by the tide. 

May 6, 7, 8, 9. Thefc days I brought ofF the iron 
bolts, opened the deck with the iron crow, and car- 
ried

bIoi»-n aihorc, which I found belonged to the head of 
the Ihip. 

-*/(/ 24, To this day I woriccd on the wrcd, 
and with great difficulty looiened fome things b 
much with the crow, that at the firft flowing tide 
feveral cafks floated out, and many of the feamens 
chefts ; yet that day nothing came to land, but jmc- 
ces of timber, and a hogfhead which had fome Brafl 
pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of 
7une (except neceffary times for food and reft) and 
had I known how to have built a boat, I had timber 
and planks enough : I had alfo near lOO weight of 
iheetlead. 

yune 16. As I was wandering towards the fca- 
fide, I found a large tortoife or turtle, being the 
iirft I had feen on the ifland, though, as I after- 
wards found, there were many on the other fide of it.

yune 20. Awake all night, my head rack*d with 
pain, and fevcriih. 

'June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the 
diimal apprebenfions of my condition : Pniy*d to 
God frequently, but very confufedly. 

June 22. Something better, but ftill uneafy in my 

A^ain relapfed, much as before. 

A'lendcd a fecond time. 

A violent ague for feven hours, cold and 
hot fits, fuccecded with faint f)vcats. 

June 2b. Better, but very weak ^ yet I fc rambled 
put, /hot a ihe-goat, broujght it home, and broiled 
(bme of it : I would wilhngly haver flewed it, an4 
made fome broth, but had no pot. 

JuM 27. All this dav I was afflidled with an ague t 
thirfty, yet could not nelp myfelf to water : Pray'd 
Xs^ God in thcfc words : Lord^ in pity look upon me^ 
Lord^ have mercy upon me^ have mercy upon me! After 
this I fell afleep, which I found had much refrefhcd 
me when I awaked. I fell aflccp a fecond time, and 
fell into this ftrange and terrible fort of dream. 

Methought i was fitting on the fame fpot of 
ground, at thcoutfideof thewall, where I fat when 
me ftorm blew after the earthquake ; and that I faw 
^ man defcending from a great black cloud, and 
light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as 
a flafh of fire, that a little before furi-oundctl him ; 
liis countenance inconceivably terrible ; the earth, 
iU it were, trembled when he ftcpt upon the ground^ 
md flalhes of firc feemcd to fill all the air. No fooner 
[thought him landed upon, the earth, but with ^ 
!ong fpear 01;, other weapon he made towards me \ 
Dut firft afcending a rifing ground, his voice added to 
ny amazement, when 1 thought I heard him pro- 
nounce thcfe dreadful words, Vnbappy wretch ! feeing 
%U thefe: things have not brought thee to rcpctitance^ thou

Jhalt iTrmudiattly die. In pronouncing this dreadful 
fentence, I thought he went to idU me with the-' 
fpcar that was in his hand. 

Any body may think it impoffible for me to pcprefs 
the horrors of my mind at this vifioh ; and even when 
I awaked, this veiy dream made a deep impreffion 
upon my mini. The little divine knowledge I had 
I received from my father's inftru^tions, and that was 
worn out by an interrupted feries of feafaring impiety . 
for eight years fpace, except what ficknefs forced 
from me ; I don't remember I had one thought of 
lifting up my heart towards God ; but rather bad a 
certain ftupidi^y of foul, not having the lead: fcnfe of 
fear of the omnipotent Being wh^ in diftrefs, hoc 
of gratitude to him for his deliverances* N^, t^en 
I was on the defpcrate expedition on the deiart Jjfri" 
Ml (bore, I can't remember I hiad one thought of 
what would become of me, or beg his confiuation 
and affiftance in my fuflerings and diftrefs* When 
the Portugal captain took me up, and honourabi v ufed 
me ; nay, fardier, when I was even delivered from 
drowning by efcaping to this ifland, I never looked 
upon it as a judgment, but only faid I was an un- 
fortunate dog, and that's all. Indeed fome fecret 
tranfports of foul I had, which was not thro' grace, 
but only a common flight of joy, that I was yet 
alive, when my companions were all drown'd : And 
no other jov could I conceive but what is common 
with the (ailors over a bowl of punch, after they 
have efcaped the grcatcft dangers. 

The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor 
conveniences, might have called upon me for a 
thankful acknowledgment to Providence, Indeed the 
growth of my corn touched me with fome fenfe, but 
that foon wore off again : The terrible earthquake 
pointed to me as it were the finger of God, but my 
dreadful amazement continued no longer than its 
dunition. But now^ when my fpirits began to fink 
~^ ^ under 



f< 



t 47 ) 

under the burden of a ftrong diAcmper^ ajid I could 
Icifurely view ths mifcries of death prcfent itfdf 
b'jforc my eyes j then my awakened confciencc bc- 
lan to reproach me with my paft life, in which I had 

wiclceoly provoked the juftice olf* God to pour 
down his vengeance upon me. 

Such reflcdtions as thcfe opprefled mc even in the 
violence of my diftempcr. Some prayers I uttered, 
which only jprocccded from my fear of d.Mth. But 
when I conhdcrcd my father's advice and proplv.cy, 
I coul J not forbear weeping : For he told me. Thai 
if I did perfift in ny fiUy^ ijhould not onlj be deprived 
af God's hlejjing^ but have time enough to refieit upon 
my defpifing his inflruSiions\ and this in a wretched 
tifnij when none could help me. And now concluding 
it to be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to ad- 
minifter any comfort to me, I prayed, ho A'cvcr, ear- 
ncftly, to the Lord, that he would nelp me in this mjr 
great calamity. And this, I think, was the firfl time 

1 praj^ed in fmcerity for many years. But now I 
muft return to my Journal. 

June 28. Something refrefhed with flcep, and the 
iit quite off, I got up. My dream ftill occafioncd in 
me a great confternation ; and fearing that the agtie 
might return the fucceeding day, I concluded it a 
time to get fomcthing to comfort me. I filled a cafe 
bottle with water, and fet it within the reach of my 
bed I and to make it more nourifhing; and lefs chilly, 
I put fome rum into it. The next f did was to boil 
me a piece of goat's flefh, of which I eat but little. 
I was vexy weak, however walked about, dreading 
the return of my diftemper ; and at night I fupp'd on 
three of the turtle's egfi;s, which I roafted and eat, 
begging God's bleilin^ herewith. 

After I had eaten, T attempted to walk again out of 
doors with my gun ; but fo weak, that i fat down 
and looked at the Tea, which was imooth and calm : 

While 



t '4» ) ... . . 

Whfle I continued here, thcfc thoughts came info 
Iny mind. 

In what nuiriner is the produAion of the earth and 
fea, which I have feen fomuthof? From whence 
came myfelf, and all other creatures living, and of 
what are we made i 

• Our beings were affuredly created by fome Al- 
inighty invihble Power, who framed the earth, the 
fea, 2tiid air, and all therein. But what is that 
"Power? 

Certainly it muft follow, that God has created it 
all. Yet, faidl, if God has made ^1 this, he muft 
be the ruler of them all, and what is relating there- 
to ; for certiinly the power that makes muft indif- 
"putably have a power to guide and dire6l them. And 
if this be fo (as certainly it muft) nothing can /hap- 
pen without his knowledge or appointment* Then 
iurely, if nothing happens without God*s appoint- 
ment, certainly God has' appointed thefc my fuf- 
'ferings to b^fal me. And here I fixed my firm be- 
lief that it was his will that it fliould be fo ; and then 
proceeded to inquire, why fhould God deal with me 
in this manner ? Or what had I done thus to deferve 
his indignation ? 

Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me 
as a blafphe'm^r i crying with a loud and piercing 
Voice, Unworthy wretch ! dare you ajk what you have 
'done? Look upon your paji life^ and fee what yoii have 
lift .undone. Afk >thyfelf, why thou wert not long 
.ago in the mercilefs hahds of death ? Why not 
' drowned jn Yarmouth roads^ or killed in the fight 

* when the fliip was taken by the Sdttee man of war ? 
'Why not entombed in the bowels of wild beafts on 

the African . coaft, or drowned here when all thy 

companions fuffered fhipwreck. 

Struck dumb with thefe reflexions, I rofe up in a 

penfive manner,' being fo thoughtful that Tcould not 

^go to fleep : And fearing the dreadful return of my 

fc^ diftcmpcr 



[ 49 ] 
difte'mper, it caufcd me to remember that tbc Bra^ 
filiam ufe tobacco for almoft all difeafes. I then went 
to my chcft, in order to find fome, where heaven no 
doubt directed me to a cure for both foul and body ; 
for there I found one of the Bibles, wliich till this 
time I had neither leifurc nor inclination to look 
into : I took both the tobacco and that out of the 
cheft, and laid them on the table. Several experi- 
ments did I try with the tobacco : Firft I took a 
leaf, and chewed it ; but it being very green and 
ftrong, almoft ftupified me. Next I ftce|>ed it in 
fome rum an hour or two, refolving when I went to 
bed to take a doze of it ; and in the third place, I 
burnt fome over a pan of fire, holding my nofe over 
it fo long as I could endure the lealt heat without 
fuflFocation. 

In the intervals of this operation, though my head 
was giddy and difturbed at the tobacco, I took up 
the Bible to read ; No fooner did I open it, but 
there appeared to me thefe words. Call on me in the dciy 
oftrouiU^ and I will deliver ^ and thou jhalt glorifj mc. 
At firft this fentcnce made a very deep impreifion 
on my heart j but foon wore off again, when I con- 
fidered the word deliver v/^s foreign to me. And as 
the children o^ Ifrael faid, when they were promifcd 
flefh to eat. Can Godfpread a table in the wildernefs ^ 
In like manner I began to fay. Can God hinifelf 
deliver me from this dcfojate iiliiiul ? However, the 
words would ftill return to my mind, and after made 
a greater impreflion upon me. As it now was very 
late, and the tobacco had dozed my head, 1 was in- 
clined to flcep,; but before I would lie down, I fell 
on my knees, and implored the promilb that God 
had made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that if I called 
upon him in the day of troiilU^ he woidd deliver me. 
With much difficulty I after drank the rum, where- 
in I had ftee^)ed the tobacco ; which flying in my 
head very violently, threw me ii;to fuch a profound 
E fleep.

flreps that It was three o clock the next day before 
I awaked ; or rather, I belie\-e, I C :pt two days, ha- 
ving certainly loft a day in my own account, and I 
could never tell any otficr way. When I got up, 
my fpirits were lively and chearful ; my ftomach 
much better, being very hungry ; and, in fhort, no 
fit returned the next day, which was the 29th, but 
much altered for the better. 

The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not 
far, and kiird a fea fowl or two, refembling a brand-? 
goofe, which }'et I cared not to eat when I brought 
them home, but dined on two more of the turtle'^ 
eggs. In the evening I renewed my medicine, ex- 
cept not taking that quantity, neither did I chew of 
the leaf, or hold my head over the fmoak, yet the 
next day I had a little fpice of the cold fit^ which 
was en the ift of Jidy* 

July 2. I took my medicines as I did the firft time* 
, July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In 
this condition, I often thought of thefe words, IwiU 
deliver thee j and while at feme times I would think 
of the impoilibility of it, other thoughts would re- 
prehend me for difregarding the deliverances I had 
received, even in the moft forlorn, and diftrcfled 
condition. What regard had I to God's abundant 
mercies ? Had I done my part ? He had delivered me^ 
hut I had not glorified him \ as much as to fay, I had 
not own'd and been thankful for that as a deliver- 
ance, and how could I expcft a greater ? So much 
did this fenfibly touch my heart, that I gave God 
thanks for my recovery from ficknefs in the moft 
humble proftration. 

July 4. This morning I began ferioufly to ponder 
on what is written in the New Tejlament^ refolving to 
read a chapter every morning and night, as long as 
my thoughts would engage me : But when foon after 
I kt about this work ferioufly, I found my heart 
deeply aficcled with the impiety of nly paft life : 

Thefe 



Thcfe worJ^ that T thought wjre fpokcn to mc in my 
dream revivjJ, All theft things b^ve not brought thi-f 
to repentance : After this, I begged of GoJ xo ailift 
me with his holy fpirit in returninjT to my iluty, 
wh'^n piirufmg the fcriptures one day, 1 ctme to 
thefe Aords, He has exalted a Prince and a Saviour^ 
to give repentance, and to give remijjion : Immediately 

' I laid down the book, and with up- lifted hands to 
heaven, loudly cried, O hlrffld J^-fus^ thou Son of 
David, yeftis^ thou exalted Prince and Savisurj give 
tne repentance I And now indeed I pr»iyed with a true . 
fenfc of my condition, and a more certain hope 
founded on the word of God : Now I had a difFcrcnt 
fenfc of thefe words. Call on me^ and I 'ivill deliver 
you \ that is, from the dreadful load of guilt, which 
opprefled my (inful foul ; and not from a folitary life, 
which might rather be called a hlcfling (feeing I want- 
ed neither food nor raiment) than living among the 
race of human -kind, furroundcd with fo much op- 
preflion, mifery and afHidlioii : And, in a word, I 
came to this conclufion, T'hat a deliverance from 
fin, was a much greater blcinn;^ than a deliverance 
from afHiftion. But again I proceed to my journal. 
To the 24th of July y I v/alk'd about with my gun, 
a little and a little at a time, having been reduced to 
the greateft extremity of weaknefs. The applica- 
tion and experiment I ufcd were perfeitly new; n':i- 
thcr could I recommend it to any one's praftice. 
For though it carried ofF the fit, it very much 
weakened me j and I had frequently convulfions in 

• my nerves and limbs for fome time. From hence I 
learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, cfpe- 
cially when it was attended with ftorms and hurri- 
canes of wind, was moft pernicious to health. In 
this ifland I had been about ten months, never all the 
while having fceri any human-kind, and fo account- 
ed myfelf as fole monarch j and, as I grew better, 

. having fecured my habitation to my mind, I refolvcd 

F. 2 to 



[ 52 ] 

to make a tour round my kingdom, in order to mak^ 
riew difcoveries. 

The 15th of July I began my journey. I firft 
went to the creek, where 1 had brought niy rafts on 
(here ; and travelling farther, found the tide going 
no higher than two miles up, wher^ there was a little 
brook of running water, on the banks of which were 
many pleafant favannas or meadows, plain, fmooth, 
and covered with grafs : On the riling parts, where 
I fuppofed the w^ter did not reach, I perceived a 
great deal of tobacco growing to a very m"on^ ftalk : 
Several other plants I likewife found, the virtues of 
which I did not underftand. But a long time I 
fearched for the caflava root, which I knew the /«- . 
didm in that climate made their bread of, but all in 
vain. There were feveral plants of aloes, though at 
that time I knew not what they were: Likewife I faw 
feveral fugar-canes, but imperfeft, for want of culti- 
vation. With thefe few difcoveries I came" back 
that night, and flcpt contentedly in my little caftle. 
The next day, being the i6th, going the fame 
way, and farther than the day before, I found the 
country more adorned vrith woods and trees. Here 
I perceived different fruits, which lay in very great 
abundance. The hielons in plenty lay on the 
ground ; and clutters of grapes, ripe and very ri<;h, 
fpread over the trees. You may imagine I was glad 
of this difcovery, yet eat venr fparingly, left I fhould 
throw myfelf into a flux or rever. As for the grapes, 
I found them of excellent ufe 5 for when I bad dried 
them in the fun, which preferved them as dried rai- 
fmsare kept, they proved very wholcfome and nourifh- 
ing, and ferved me in thofe feafons when no grapes 
were to be had. 

The night drawing on apace, I afcended up a. tree, 
and flept very comfortably, though it was the firft 
time I had lain out of my habitation. And when 
the morning came, 1 proceeded with great pleafure 

on 



[ 53 ] 
on my way, travelling about four miles, as I ima- 
gined, by the length of the valley, dirc*iting my 
courfe northward, there being a ridge of hills on the 
fouth and north fide of me. At the end of this val- 
ley I came to an opening, where the country ll'ciiicd 
to dcfccnd to the weft : There i found a little fpring- 
of frefh water proceeding out of the fide of a h Hi, 
with its chryftaJ ftreams running dire<Jtly eafh And 
^ijidced here my ienfes were chkU'mcd with the mod 
lovely objedl nature, could afford j for the country 
appeared fo flourifhing, green and delightful, that to 
mc it feemed like a planted gardw-n. I then dcfccndcd 
on the fide of thit delicious vale, when I found a> 
bundance of cocoa, orange, lemon and citron trees, 
but very wild and barren at that time. As for the 
juice ot which I afterwards ufcd to mix in water, 
which made it very cool and refrcfhing. And now 
I was rcfolved to carry home and lay up a ftorc of 
grapes, limes, and lemons againft the approaching 
wet feafon : So laying them up in feparatc parcels, 
aiid then taking a few of each with me, I returned 
to my little caftle, after having fpent three days in 
this journey : But before I got home, the gnipcs 
were fo bruifed that they were utterly fpoiled, the 
limes Jhdced were good,- but few could i bring away. 
•7%/y 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned 
thither again ; but to my great furprize found all the 
grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abundance 
eaten, which made me to conclude there were wild 
creatures thereabouts. To remedy this, I gather 'd 
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon 
the out-branches of the trees, th it they might cure . 
and dry in the fun : and having v/ell loaded my ft If ' 
with limes and lemons, I returned ouce more ty my 
old place of refidencc. 

Ai.i now it was, that contemplating on the fruft- 

fuJncfs of the valley, the pleafantncfs of the iituiuion, 

li 3 tiie 






to-.* -w 



[ 54 ] 

the fecurity from ftorms on that fide the water, and 
the delightfulnefs of an adjacent wood ; I concluded 
I was fettled in the worft part of the country, and 
therefore was thinkuig to remove my habitation. But 
when I confidered again, that though it was pleafant, 
it was not by the fea-fide, where there was a poflibili- 
ty, fome time or other, a ftiip might either be driven 
to, or fail by that coaft; and that toenclofe myfelf 
among hills and woods, muft certainly fruftrate all 
hopes of a deliverance ; I refolved to let my qaftle 
remain where Providence had firft afligned it. Yet 
fo raviflied was I with this place, that I made me a 
little kind of bower, furrounding it at a diftance 
with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well 
flaked, and filled with bull-rufhes,. and having fpent 
a great part of the month of July^ I think it waS the 
fim of Augufl before I began to enjoy my labour. 

Aug. 3. rerceiving my grapes to be dry, I took 
them from the trees, and they proved excellent good 
raifins of the fun 5 the moft of which I carried to 
my cave ; and happy for me I did fo, by which I 
iaved the beft part of my winter food. 

Aug, 14. It began to rain this day; and though I 
had made me a tent like the other, yet having no 
ihelter of a hill to keep me from ftorms, nor a cave 
behind me to retreat to, I was obliged to return to 
my old caftle. Still the rain continued more or lefs 
every day till the middle of OSiober ; and fometimes 
fo violently, that I could not ftir out of my catc 
for feveral days. This feafon i found my family to 
encreafe ; for one of my cats that ran away from me, 
and whom I thought had been dead, returned about 
Augufl with three kittens at her heels, like herfelf, 
which I thouL^ht ftrange, becaufe both my cats were 
females, and the v/ild cats of the ifland feemed to be 
of a different kind from our European cats ; but from 
thcfe cats proceeded fuch numbers^ that I was forced 

to 



r 55 1 

to kill and deftroy them as I would do wild beads Vr 
vermin. 

To the 26th of this month T could not ftir out, it 
raining ince/Tintly ; when beginning to want food, 
I was compelled to venture twice, the firftof which 
I Ihot a goat, and afler found a very large tortoiie. 
The manner of regulating my foocl was thus : A 
bunch of raifins ferved me for breakfaft j a piece of 
goal's flefh or turtle broiled for my dinner ; and two 
or three turtle's eggs for my fupper. While the rain 
lalted, 1 daily worked two or three hours at enlar- 
ging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards 
one Ade^till 1 came to the outfide of the hill, and 
made a door or wav out, which came beyond my 
fence or wall, and fo I came in and out this way. 
But after I had done this, I was troubled to fee myfelf 
thus expofed, though I could not perceive any thing 
to fear, a goat being the biggeft creature I had fecn 
upon this ifland. 

Sept, 30. Cafting up my notches on my poft, which 
amounted to 365, 1 concluded this to oe the anni- 
verfary of mv landing ; and therefore humbly pro- 
ftrating myfelf on the ground, confeffing my fms, 
acknowledging God's righteous judgments upon me, 
and praying to Je/us Cnrtfl to have mercy on me, I 
faded for twelve hours tillthe going down of the fun ; 
and then eating a bifcuit and a bunch of grapes, laid 
me on the bed, and with great copfort took my night's 
repofe. Till this time, having no fenfe of religion, 
I never diftinguifhed the Saboath-day j but now I 
made a longer notch than ordmary for the days of 
refly and divided the weeks as well as I could, tho* 
r found I had loft a day or two in my account. Soon 
after, my ink failing, i omitted a aaily memoran- 
dum of indifferent things, and contented myfelf to 
write down only the molt remarkable events of my 
life. The rainy and dry feafons appeared now* re- 
gular to me, and experience taught me how to pro- 
vide 



[ 56 ] 

Vide for them ; yet, in one thing I am going to re- 
late, my experience very much failed me. You may 
call to mind what I have mentioned of fome bar- 
ley and rice which I had faved ; about thirty ftalks 
of the former, and twenty of the latter ; and at that 
time the fun being in its fouthern pofition going; from 
me together with the rains, made me conclude it a 
very proper feafon to fow it. Accordingly I dug up 
a piece of ground with my wooden fpade, and divi- 
ding it in two parts, fowed about two-thirds of my 
feed, preferving by me about a handful of each. And 
happy it was . 1 did fo,^ for no rains falling, it was 
choaked up, and never appeared above the earth till 
the wet feafon came again, and then it grew as if it 
had been newly fown. 

I was refolved ftill to make^ another trial ; and 
feeking for a moifter piece of ground near my bower, 
there i fowed the reft of my feed in February ^ a little 
before the vernal equinox, which having the rainy 
months of March and April to water it, yielded a 
noble crop, and fprung up very pleafantly. Part of 
the feed i had yet faved, not daring to venture aU ; 
and my crop amounted to above half a peck of each 
fort. But by this time I found the proper feafons to 
fbw in ; and that two feed-times and two harvefts I 
might expeft every year. 

No fooner were the rains over, and the flakes, 
which 1 had cut from the treps, Ihooting like willow 
trees the firft year after lopping their heads,^ than t 
was ignorant of the tree I cut them from ; but they 
grew fo regularly beautiful, that they made a moft 
lovely appearance, and flourifhed fo in three years 
time, that I refolved to cut fome more, and thcfe 
foon growing made a glorious fence, as in order I 
Ihall obfer^ve. 

And now I perceived that the feafons of thfe year 
might generally be divided, not into fummer and win- 
ter, '

As the winds happened tq blow, fo the wet feafons 
would^continue longer or.fliprter : . But when Lfound 
the illi'ccnfequences of^ being abroad in the rain, I 
took care before-hand to furnifh myfelf with provi- 
ilons i and during the wet months fat within doors 
as much as pomble : And in this time I contrived 
to make many things that I wanted, though it was 
with much labour and pains before l could accom- 
)liih them. The firft I tried was to make a bafket; 
>ut all the twigs I could get, proved fo brittle, that 
I could not then perform it. But now it proved of 
excellent advantage to me, that when a boy, took 

frreat delight in itanding at a bafkct-maker's in tlie 
amc town where my father lived, to view them at 
work, and like other boys curious to fee the man- 
ner of their working thefe things, and very officious 
t.o affift, I perfe^ly learned the method of it, and 
wanted nothing but the tools. And tlien it camo

into my mind, that the twigs of that tree of which I 
made my ftakes might be as tough as fallow, w How, 
and ofiers, growing in England-, and fo refolvlng to 
make an experiment, I went the next day to my 
country feat, and found fome fit for my turn ; and 
cutting down numbers with my hatchet, I dried 
them in my pale, and when fit to work with, carried 
them to my cave, where i employed myfelf in mi- 
king fever^l forts of bafkets, to put in whatfoever I 
pleafcd : It is true, they were not cleverly inade, yet 
they fcrved my turn upon all occafions. 

But flill I wanted two neceflary things $ I had ne* 
vei a ca(k to hold ihy liquor, except two rumlets al« 
moft full of rum, a few bottles of. an ordinary fize, 
and fome fquare cafe bottles : Neither had I a pot to 
boil any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit to make 
broth or flew a bit or meat. After this, I wanted 
a tobacco pipe ; for which lafl I found an expedient. 

I kept liiyfelf employed in planting my fecond row 
of ftakes, and workea in this wicker the dry jeafom 
You may remember before, that when I travelled up 
to the brook, I had a mind to fee the whole ifland ; 
accordingly, taking my dog, gun, hatchet, twd bif- 
cuit cakes, a great bunch of raifms, with a larger 
quantity of powder and fhot than ufual, I began my 
journey. And having pafTed the vale where my bower 
floe d, I camewthin view of the fea, lying to the weft, 
when it being a clear day, I fairly defcried land, but 
could not fay whether it was an ifrand or a continent: 
It extended from the W. to the W. S. W. about ten. 
or fifteen leagues, as ! concluded. Neither could J 
tell what place this might be,* only thought it was 
part of jfmerica^znd where I might have been in a mi- 
ferable condition had 1 landed. Again, 1 confidered, 
that if this was the Spanijh ccaft, certainly one time or 
other I fhould fee fome fhip pafs by; and if it was not, 
then itmuft be the favagecoaft, between the Spanijb

country and Brafil^ which abound with cannibals of 
man -waters th.'.t clcA'our hunun-kind. 

A- I proTctd'-d f jrward, 1 found this fide of the 
in.ndniucii rrou pkafnni ihanniinc, the fii-lds fra- 
gr lie, adorn :d with fvveft flowers and verdant grafs, 
t og c ti i ^ r with fe vc r al v j ry fi ne wof x ! s. T h c re were 
p.nots in plenty, which nude me long for on* to be 
my companion ; but it was with great difficulty that 
I could knock it down with in/ it-c^ ; and it was 
fomc years I kept hini at home, before 1 could get 
him to call me by my name. 

In the low grounds I found various forts of hares 
-and foxes as I thought them, but much diiFerent from 
all I had met with : Several of th.-fe i kill'.'d, but 
never eat them ; neither inocvd had I any occafion, 
for abounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, 
I could defy Leadenball msLrkct to furnifh mc a better 
table. In this journey I did not travel above two 
miles in a day, bccaufe I took feveral turns and 
windings, to fee what difcoveries I could make, re- 
turning weary enough to the place where I dcfigned 
to reft all night, which was either in a tree, or in a 
place which I furroundcd with ftakes, that nov/ild 
creature might fuddcnly furprize mc. When I came 
to thfe fea-inore, I was amazed to fee the fplendour 
of it : Its ftrand was covered with fhclls of the moft 
beautiful fifh, and conftantly abounding witli iimu- 
merable turtles, and fowls of many kinds, v/hich I 
was ignorant of, except thofe called Penguins, I might 
have (hot as many as I pleafed, but was fparing of 
my ammunition, rather chufing to kill a flie-goat, 
which with much difficulty 1 did, becaufc of the 
flatncfs of the country. 

Now though this journey produced the moft plea- 
fing fatisfacSion, yet my haoitation was fo natural to 
me, that I did not n pme at my being featcd on the 
vorft part of the iflund : And fo travelling about 12 
miles towards the £a/l^ I fct a great pile on the 

iliore 



[ 6o ] 

Ihore for s mark, ooocludlng that mv next joumej 
(ho'jld be on the ether fide of the iHand eaft from my 
raftle, and (o round till I came to my poft -again. 
Hem-ever, I took another war hack, thinking I could 
not mils by having a ccnflant view of the country ; 
hut fcarce had I trz^veiled three miles, when I de- 
fccrAcd into a very large ^-alley, (b furrounded with 
hills that were coiered with wood, that I had no guide 
but by the fun, nor even then, unlefs I knew well 
the pofition of the fun at that time of the day. What 
added to my misfortune was, the weather proved (o 
hazy, for three or four days, as to oblige me to return 
to my poft by the fea-flde, and (b backwards the 
feme way I came. My dog furprized a kid in this 
journey, and would have kHled it, had I not pre- 
vented him. I had often been mufing whether I 
could not get a kid or two, and fo raife a breed of 
tame goats to fupply me after my anmiunition was 
fpent. Upon which I made a collar for this little 
creature with a ftring made of rope-yarn which I al- 
ways carried about with me ; and when I came to my 
bower^ there I inclofed and left him, and after a 
month's time in this journey I came home to my old 
habitation. 

Nobody can fuppofe otherwife, but that- 1 had 
a; plcafing fatisfaftion, when 1 returned to mty little 
<faftle, and repofed myfelf in my hammock. • After 
. this journey, 1 refted myfelf a week, and the prin- 
cipal concern 1 then had was^ to make a cage for my 
pretty poll. And then I began to confider the poor 
kid I had left at my bower ; and immediately I went 
to fetch it home. When I came there, 1 found the 
young creature almoft ftarvcd j when feeding it with 
branches of fuch fhrubs as I could find, I tied it as 
before ; but there was no occafion, for it followed me 
like a dog, and as I conftantly fed it, became fo lo- 
ving, gentle and fond, that it commenced one of my 
don.cfhcs, and would never leave me. 

The rainy fcafon of the autumnal equinox being 

now 



•[ 6i •] 
now come, I kept the 30th of Septwiber in the moft 
folemn munner as ufual, it being the third year of 
my abode in tlie ifland. I fpent the whole day in ac^ 
knowlcdging God's mercies ; in giving him thanks 
for making this folitary life as agreeable, and Icf's 
Hnful, than that of human focicty; and for the com- 
munications of his grice to my foul, fupporting, 
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
providence, and hope for his eternal prcfcnce in the 
world to come. 

Before I coiifidered how happy I was in this (late 
of life towards that accurfed manner of living I for- 
merly ufed, while either I was hunting or viewing 
the country, the anguilh of my foul would break out 
upon me on a fudden, and my very heart would fmk 
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, 
the defarts 1 was in ; and how I vva^ a prifoner locked 
up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in 
an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes and with- 
out redemption. And in this condition, I would 
often wring my hands and weep like a child : Even 
in the middle of my work this fit would take me ; 
and then I would immediately fit down and figh, 
looking on the ground for an hour or two together, 
till fuch time as my grief would be vented, by burft- 
ing out into melting tears. 

As one morning 1 was fadly pondering in my 
mind, I opened my Bible, when immediately I fixed 
my eyes upon thcfe words, I wilhie^^n^ leave thee nor 
for fake thee I Surely, thought i, thefe words arc di- 
rected to me; orelfe, why fliould they appear juft at 
a moment when I am bemoaning my forlorn condi- 
tion ? And if God does not forlUke mc, what matters 
it, fmce he can make me more happy in this ftate of 
life than if I enjoyed the greatell Ipkndour in the 
world ? But while I was going to return God 
thanks for my prefent ftate, fomething fcemed to 
ihock my mind, as if it had thus faid, Unworthy 
F wretch I 



' [ 62 ] 

^^vretchl can you pretend to be thankful for a con- 
dition, from which you would pray to be delivered? 

Here I ftopt ; and though [ could not fay, I 

thank'd the Divine Majefty for being there, yet I 
gave God ffhanks for placing to my view my former 
wicked courfe of life, and granting me a true know- 
ledge of repentance : And whenever 1 opened or fhut 
the Bible, I bleft kind Providence that directed my 
goods without my order, and for affifting me to fave 
it from the power of the raging ocean. 

And now beginning my third , year, my feveral 
^daily employments were thefe : //Vy?, My duty to 
heaven, ana diligently reading the Holy Scriptures, 
w^hich I did twice or thrice every day. Secondfyj 
Seeking provifion with my gun, which commonly 
took me up when it did not rain, three hours every 
morning. Thirdly^ Th6 ordering, curing, prefer- 
ving, and cooking what I had killed or catched for 
my fupply, which took me up a great part of the 
day : and in the middle of the day, the fun being in 
its heighth, it was fo hot that I could not ftir out; 
fo that 1 had but four hours to work in : And then 
my want of tools, help, and fkill, wafted- a great 
deal of time ; for I was two and forty days making 
a board fit for a long fhelf, whereas two fawyers, 
. with their tools and faw-pit, would have cut (everal 
out of the fame tree in half a day ; but this was the 
cafe, it was to be a large tree, becaufe my board was 
to be broad ; I was three days in cutting it down, 
and two more in lopping off the boughs, and redu- 
cing it to a piece of timber ; this I hack'd and h^w'd 
off each fide till it became light to move ; then I 
turned it, made one fide of it fmooth and flat as a 
board, from end to end, then turned it downward, 
cutting the other fide, till I brought the plank to be 
about three inches thick, and fmooth on both fides. 
Any body may judge my great labour and fedgue 

' in 



r 63 1 

in fuch a piece of work ; but this I went throu^li 
with patience, as alfo many other things that my 
circumftances made neceflary for me to do* 

But now came my harveu months, Novtmber and 
DeambiTj in which 1 had the plcafing profpcft of 
avery good crop : But fuch was my misfortune, that 
the goats and hares having once tailed of the fwcct- 
nefs of the blade, kept it fo fliort, that it had not 
ftreneth to (hoot up into a ftalk : I'o prevent which, 
I enclofed it with a hedge, and by day (hot fomc of 
its devourers \ and my dog, which i had tied to the 
field gate, keeping barking all night, frightened th;: 
creatures away. 

No fooncr did I get rid of thefe, but other enc- 
mies appeared, whole flocks of fsveral forts of bir Js, 
who only waited till my back was turned to ruin me. 
So much did this provoke me, that i let fly, and 
killed three of the malefa^ors ; s nd afterwards fervcd 
them as they do notorious thieves in England^ hung 
them up in chains as a terror toothers. And indeed 
fo good an efFeft had this, that they not only forfook 
the corn, but all that part of the ifland, io long as 
thefe criminals hung there. 

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of 
Decembtr^ which was my fecond harveft of the year, 
I reaped it with a fey the made .of one of my broad 
fwords. I had no great fatigue in cutting down my 
firft crop, it was fo flender ; the ears of which I 
carried home in a bafkct, rubbine it out with my 
hands inftead of thrafhing it j and when my harvell: 
was over, found my half peck of feed protluce near 
two buihels of rice, and two bufhels and a half of 
barley. And now i plainly forefaw that, by (iod's 
goodnefs, 1 fhould be furnifhed with bread ; but yet 
1 was concerned becaufe 1 knew not how to grind or 
make meal of my corn, nor bread, neither knew how 
to bake it. Upon thefe confiderations, I would not 
tafte any of tlie crop, but preferve it againft the next 
F 2 fcafon. 



. [ 64 ] 
feafon, and in the mean while ufe my beft endea* 
vours to pravide myfelf with materials to make bread. 

But where were my labours to end ? The want of 
a plough to turn up the earth, or fhovel to dig it, I 
conquered by making me a wooden fpade made after 
a wooden manner : The want of a harrow, I fup- 
pHed myfelf by dragging over the corn a great bough 
of a tree : When it was growing or fully ripe, I 
was forced to fence it, mow it, carry^it home, thraih 
it, part it from the chafF, and fave it : And after all 
this, I wanted a mill to grind it, ficves to drefs it, 
yeaft and fait to make it into bread, and an oven to 
bake it. This fet my brains on work to find fome 
expedient, for every one of thefe ncceflaries, againft 
the next harveft. 

And now, having more feed, my jfirft care was to 
' prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large 
flat pieces of ground near my caftle for that purpofe, 
in which I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good 
hedge, which took me up three months time, by 
which it was the wet feafon. While the rain kept 
me within doors, I found feveral occadons to cm- 
ploy myfelf 5 and while at work, ufed to divert my- 
ftlf with talking to my parrot, learning him to know 
and fpeak his own name, POLL, the firft welcome 
word I ever heard fpoke on the ifland. 1 had been a 
long time contriving how to make earthen veffels, 
which I wanted extremely j and when. I confidered 
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find any proper clay, j might botch up a pot, flrong 
enough, when dried in the fun, to bear handling, 
and to hold any thing that v/as dry, as corn, meal, 
and ether things. 

To be Ihort, the clay I found ; but it would oc- 
cafion the moll ferious perfon to fmilc to fee what 
aukv/ard ways I took, and vvhat ugly mifhapen things 
I made ; hov7 many either fell out or crack'd by the 
vickntheat of the fun, and fell iii pieces wh:n they 
. - were 



t 6s ] 
were removed : So that I think it was two months 
time before I could pcrfedl any tiling, and aficr this 
great fatigue, made two cl unify things in imitation 
of earthen jars., Thcfc however 1 very gently placed 
in wicker bafkcts, made on purpofc ftir them, and 
between the pot and the bafkcts, iluftcd it full of 
rice and barley ftraw; and thefe I prcfumcd would 
hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal whi n the 
corn was bruifed. But as for fmaller things, I nude 
them with better fuccefs, which the fun baked very 
hard, fuch as little round pots, flat difhes, pitchers, 
and pipkins. 

Yet Itill I wanted one thing abfolutcly ncccflary, 
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold any 
liquid thing, but to bear the fire, which none of 
thefe could do. It once happened, that as 1 was 
putting out my fire, I found therein a broken piece 
of one of my veflfcls burnt hard as a rock, and red as 
a tile. This made me contrive how to order my fire, 
as to make it burn fome pots ; and having no notion 
of a kiln, orof glazing them with lead, I fixed three 
large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile one 
upon another. The fire I plied round the outfide 
with dry wood, and on the top, till I faw the pots 
in the infide red hot, and found that they did not 
crack at all ; and when I perceived them perfectly 
red, I let one of them ftand in the fire about five or 
fix hours, till the clay melted by the extremity of 
the heat, i.nd would have run to glafs, had i fuftcrcd 
it ; upon which I flacked my fire by degrees, till 
the redncfs abateid ; and watching them til! the 
morning, I found I had three very good pipkins, 
and two earthen pots, as- well burnt and fit ior my 
turn as I could dcfirc. 

No joy could be greater than mine at this difco- 

very : For after this, I may fay, I wanted for no 

fort of earthen- ware, i filled one of my pipkins with 

water to boil me fome meat, wlvch it did admirably 

F 3 well. 



[ 66 ] 

well, and with a piece of kid I made mc fome good 
broth, as well as my circumftances would afford me 
at th^t time. 

The next concern I had was to make me a ftone- 
mortar to beat fome corn in, inftead of a mill to 
grind it. Here indeed I was at a great lofs, as not 
being fit for a ftone-cutter j and many days I fpent 
to find out a great ftone big enough to cut hollow 
and make fit for a mortar, and ftrong enough to bear 
the weight of a peftle, as would break the corn 
without filling it with fand : But all the ftones of the 
jfland being of a mouldering nature, rendered my 
fearch fruitlefs, and then I refolved to look out a 
great block of hard wood j which having foon founds 
I formed with my axe and hammer, and then with 
infinite labour made a hollow -place in it, juft_as the 
IncUans of Bra/il make their canoes. When I had 
finiflied this, I made a great peftle of iron-wood^ 
which I had formerly laid up againft my fuccecding 
harveft. 

My next bufinefs was to make me a fieve, to fift 
my meal, and part it from the bran and the hufk'. 
Having no fine thin canvas to fearch the meal thro', 
I could not tell what to do ; what linen I had was 
reduced to rags : I had goat's hair enough, but nei- 
ther tools to work it, nor did I know how to fpiii- 
it : At length 1 remembered I had fome neckcloths 
of callicoe or muflin of the failors, which I had, 
brought out of the fhip, and with thcfe I made three 
fmall fieves, proper enough for the work. 

And now 1 come to confider the baking part in 
courfe. The want of an oven I fupplicd by making 
fome earthen pans very broad, but not deep. When 
I had a mind to bake, I made a great fire upon my 
hearth, the tiles of which I had made myfdf, and 
when the wood was burnt into live coals, I fpread 
them all overitj till it became very hot, then fweep-- 

ing 



[ 6; ] 
ing them away, I fet down my loaves, and whelm- 
ing down the earthen pots upon them, drew the 
afhes and coals all around t!ic outfide of the pots to 
continue the heat ; uid in this manner I ufcd to 
bake my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a 
complete paftry-cook, making my fclf of the rice fcvc- 
ral cakes and puddings. 

It is no' wonder that all thcfe things took me up 
the bcft part of a year, fince what intermediate time 
I had was beftowed in managing my new harv;rft and 
huibandry ^ for in the proper feafon I reaped my 
corn, carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in 
my large bafkets, till I had time to rub, inftead of 
threfhing it. And now indeed my corn increafed 
fo much that it produced me about twenty buiheU 
of barley, and as much of rice, that 1 not only bc- 
^n to ufe it freely, but was thinking how to en- 
large my barns, and was refolved to low fo much at 
a time as would be fuificient for me a whole year. 

All this while the piofpc6l of land, which I had 
feen from the other fide of the ifland, ran in my 
mind. I ftill meditated a deliverance from this 
place, though the fear of greater misfortunes might 
have deterrw me from it •: For after I had attained 
that place, I run the hazard of being killed and 
eaten by the devouring cannibals ; and if they were 
not fo, yet I might be (lain, as other Europeans had 
been who fell into their hands. Notwithftanding 
all this, my thoughts ran coi)tinually upon my ac- 
quiring that fhore : And now I wanted my boy Xury, 
and the Ion? boat, witli the {boulder of mutton 
fail. Then! went to the {hip's boat that had been 
ca{l a great way on the {hore in the late Itorm. She 
was but a little removed : but her bottom was turn- 
ed up by the impetuofity and fury of the waves 
and wind. With all the {Irength I had, I tried 
whatever I could do, with levers and rollers I kid 

cut 



t 68 ] 

cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the da- 
mages fhe had (uftained. This work took me up 
three or four weeks, when ^nding my little ftrength 
all in vain, I fell to undermine it by digging away 
the fand, and fo to make it fall down, fetting pieces 
of wood to thruft and guide it in the fall. But after 
this was done, unable was I to ftir it up again, or to 
get under it, much lefs tp move it forwards to- 
wards the water, and fo I was forced t6 giVe it over: 

Not contented with this difappointment, I began 
to think whether it was not poffible for me tp make a 
canoe or periagu^ fuch as the Indi^^ns make of the 
trunk of a tree > but here I lay under particular 
inconveriiencies, want of tools to make it, and 
want of hands to move it to the water when it was 
made. However, to work I went upon it, flopping 
all the enquiries I could make,' with this very fimple 
anfwer I made to myfelf, let's firft make it. Til 
warrant I'll find fome way or other to get it along 
when it is done. 

I firft cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet 
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the ftiimp, 
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end 
of twenty-two feet, after which it leffened for a 
fpace, and then parted into branches. Twenty 
days was I hacking and- hewing this trte at the 
bottom, fourteen more in cutting ofl:' the branches 
and limbs, and a whole month in fhaping it like 
the bottom of a boat ; as for the infide, I was three 
weeks, with a mallet and chiffel, clearing it in fuch 
a manner as that it was big enough to carry twenty- 
fix men, much bigger than ever a canoe I faw in 
my life, and confequently fufficient to tranfport me 
and all my efFefts to that wiflied for fhore I fo ar- 
dently deiired. 

Nothing remained now, but indeed the greateft 
difficulty, to get it into the water, it lying about loo 

yards 



[ 69 ] 
prds from it. To remedy the firft Inconvenience, 
which was a riflng hill between this boat and the 
creek, with wonderful pains and hbour i dug into 
the furfacc of the earth, and madead'eclivitv. But 
when -this was done, all the ftrcngth I hacl was as 
infufEcient to move it, as it was when I attempted 
to move the boat. Then I proceeded to meafure 
the diftancc of ground, rtfolving to make a canal, in 
order to bring the water to the canoe, fince I could 
not bring the canoe to the water. But as this fecmed 
to be impradicablc to myfcif alone, under the fpace 
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into fomc 
fort of confideration, that I concluded it impoffible 
to be done, and (b this attempt was in vain alfo. 
And now I faw, and not before, what ftupidity it 
is to begin a work before we reckon its cofts, or 
judge right of our own abilities to go through with 
its performance. 

It was in the heighth of this work, my fourth 
year expired, fmce i was caft on this ifland ; and 
then I did not forget my anniverfary, but kept it 
with the fame ardent devotion i had done before. 
But now, my hopes beine fruftrated, I looked upon 
this world as a thing I had nothing to do with ; and 
very well might I fay, as father Abraham unto Divts^ 
Between nu and thee there is a gulf fixed. And in- 
deed from the world I was feparated from its wick- 
cdnefs too, having neither the luft of the flcfli, the 
luft of the eye, or the pride of life j I had nothing 
to covet, being lord, king, or emperor over the 
whole country 1 had in policflion, v/ithout difpute, 
and without coiitroul \ 1 had loadings of corn, 
plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapts 
above meafure j but after I was ferved, what was 
all the reft to me f The money \ had by me lay as 
dcfpicable drofs, wliich I would freely have given 
for a grofs of tobacco-pipes, or a hand-mill to grind 
iny corn : In a word, tiic nature and experience of 

thcf<j 



I 70 J 
tbefc things di<Ebted to me this juft refleftion. That 
the good things of this world are no ^rther good to 
us than they are for our ufe j and that whatever we 
may heap up to give others^ we can but enjoy as 
much as we ufe and no more. 
. Thefe thoughts rendered my mind more eafy than 
ufual. Every timf I fat down to etat I did it with 
thankfulnefs, admiring the providential hand of God, 
that in this v^ ilderne^ had fpread this table to me. 
And now I jconfidered what I enjoyed, rathpr than 
what I wanted; compared my' prefent condition 
with what I at firft expefted it fhould be j how I 
ihould have done, if I had got nothing out of the 
fhip 5 that I muft have pefifhed before i had caught 
fifh or turtles ; or lived, had I found them, like a 
mere favage, by eating them raw, and pulling them 
in pieces with my claws, like a beaft, I i^ext com- ^ 
pared my ftation to that which I deferved ; how un- 
dutiful t had been to my parents, how deftitute of the 
fear of God ; ho/ void of every thing that was good ;- 
and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had 
received from heaven, being fed^^ as it were, by a 
miracle, even as great Elijah's being fed by ravens ; 
and caft on a place where there was no venemous 
creature to poifon or devour me : In fhort, ma- 
king God's tender mercies matter of great confola- " 
tion, I rjelinquiflied all fadnefs, and gave way to 
contentment. 

As long as my ink continued, which with water 
I made laft as long as I could, i ufed to minute dowa 
the days of the month on which any remarkable 
thing happened. And, 

Firft, 1 obferved, That the fame day I forfook my 
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order 
to go to fea, the fame day afterwards, in the next 
year, I was taken and made a flave by the Salke 
rover. 

The 



[ 71 ] 

The very day I efcaped out of the wreck of the 
(hip in Yarmouth roads, a yeat after, on the fame 
day, , I made my efcape from SalUe^ in my patron's * 
fiming;.boat. 

The 30th of September^ being the day of the jrear 
I was bom on, on that day twent|||^ years after, 
was I miraculoufly faved, and caft on fhorc on this 
Ifland. 

The next thing that wafted after my ink was the 
bifcuit which .1 had brought out of the (hip : And 
though I allowed myfelf out one cake a-day, for a- 
bove a twelvemonth, yet 1 was quite out of bread 
for near a year, before 1 got any corn of my own. 

In the next place, my clothes be ^an to decay, and 
^my linen had been gone long before ; however, I 
had preferved about three dozen of the failors chec- 
quered (hirts, which proved a great refreflimcnt to 
me, when the violent beams of the fun would not 
fuffer me to bear any of the feamens heavy watch- 
coats, which made me turn taylor, and after a mi- 
ferable botching manner, convert them into jackets. 
To preferve my head, I made me a cap of goat- 
IkiH, with the nair outwards, to keep out the rain 5 
which indeed ferved me fo well, that I afterwards 
made me a waiftcoat and open-kneeM breeches of 
the farfie : And then I contrived a fort of an um- 
brella,' covering it with fkins, which not only kept 
^ut the heat of the fun, but th^ rain alfo. Thus 
being eafy and fettled in my mind, n>y chiefcft hap- 
pineis was to converfe witn God, in moft heavenly 
and comfortable ejaculations. 

For five years after this I cannot fay any extraor- 
dinary thing occurred to me. My chief employ- 
ment was to cure my raifms, and plant my barley and 
rice, of both which I had a year's provifion before- 
hand. But thpugh I was difappointed in my firft 
canoe, I made it, at intermedfate times, my bufinefs 
to mfeke a fecond, of much inferior fiee 5 and it was two ' 

years 



years before I fuiifhed it. But as 1 perceived It would 
no w-ap aiifwer my dcfign of (ailing ta the other 
ihore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour 
round the iiland, to fee what further difcoverics I 
could make. To this inteftt, after having moved 
her to the w^lpr, and tried how (he would fail, I 
fitted up a little maft to her, and made a fdl of the 
(hip*s fail that lay by me. I then made lockers 
or boxes, at the end of it, to put ia necelTary prov:- 
(ions and ammunition, which would preferve them dry 
either from rain, or the fpray of the fea ; and in the 
infide of the boat I cut a long hollow place to lay my 
gun, and to keep it dry, made a dag to hang over 
it; my umbrella I (ixed in a ftep in. the ftern like 
a maft to keep the heat of the fun off me : And 
now; refolving to fee the circumference of my lit- 
tle kingdom, I viftualled my (hip for the voyage, 
putting in two dozen of my barley bread loaves, 
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of 
rum, half a goat, powder and (hot, and two watch- 
coats. It was the 6th of November^ in the 6th year 
of my reign, or captivity, that I fet out in this 
voyage, which was much .longer than I expefted, 
being obliged to put further out, by reafon of the 
rocks that lay a great way in the fea : And indeed 
fo much did thcfe rocks furprife me, that I was for 
putting back, fearing, that if I ventured further, it 
would be out of my power to return. In this con- 
fufion I came to an anchor juft off (hore, to which 
I v/aded with my gun on my (houlder, and then, 
climbing up an hill, which overlooked that point, . I 
faw the full extent of it, and refolved to run all 
hazard. 

In this profpeft from the hill, I perceived^ vio- 
lent current running to the eaft, coming very clofe 
to the point ; which 1 the more carefully obferved, 
thinking it dangerous, and that, when I came toit> 
I mi^ht be drove into, the fea by Its force, and not able 

to 



Chi 

to retarn to the ifland ; and certainly it muft hare 
been fo, had I not made this bbrcrvation ; for on the 
other fide was the like current, with this difference^ 
that it iet off at a greater diftance ; when I perceived 
there was a ftrong eddy under the land, fo that my 
chiefeft bufinefs was to work out of the firft current, 
and conveniently get into an edd). Two days 'I 
ftaid here, the wind blowing very briikly £. S. E. 
which bein^ contrary to the current, leaves a great 
breach on the fea upon the point ; fo it was not fit 
for me to keep too near the fliore, upon account of 
the breach ; nor to ftand at too great a diftance, for 
•fear of the ftreams. That night the wind abating;, 
it grew fo calm that I ventured out ; but fure^ 
I was to be a memento to all rafh and ignorant pi- 
lots : For I was no fooner come to the point, and 
not above the boat's length from the fhore, but I 
was gpt into a deep water, with a current like a mill, 
which drove my boat along fo violently that it was 
impoflible for me to keep her fo much as to the edge 
of it ; but it forced me more and more out from the 
eddy to the left of me, and all I could do with my 
paddies was ufelefs, there beine no wind to help me. 

Alas ! now I began to think myfelf quite loft ; 
fince, as the current ran on both ndes of the ifland, 
I was very certain they muft join again, and then I 
had no hopes but of pcrifhing for want, in the fea^ 
after what provifions I had was fpcnt, or before, if 
a ftorm ihould happen to arife. 

Who can conceive the prefent anguifti of my 
mind at this calamity ? With longing eyes did! 
look upon my little kingdom, and thought the ifland 
the pleafenteK place in the univerfe. Happy, thrice 
happy defart, (aid I, ftiall I never fee thee more ? 
Wretched creature ! whither am I going ? Why did 
I murmur at my lonefome condition, when now I 
would give the whole world to be there again ? 
While I was thus contemplating, 1 found myfelf to be 
G driven 



[ .74 '] 
driven about two leagues into the fea ; however, I 
laboured till my ftrength was fpent, to keep my. 
boat as far north as poffibly I could, to that fide of 
the current where the eddy lay on. ^ About noon, I 
perceived a little breeze of wind fpring up from the 
S, S. E. which overjoyed my heart the more, when, 
in about half an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. 
Had any thick weather fprung up, I had been loft 

. another way ; for having no compafs on board, I 
ihould never have found the way to fleer towards the 
ifland, if once it had difappeared ; but it proving the 

. contrary, I fet up my maft again, fpread my foil, 
and flood away northward as much as I could, to get 

.'rid of the curirent : And no fooner did the boat be- 
gin to flretch away, but I perceived, by the clearnefs 
of the water, a change of ^he current was near ; 
for where it was clear, the current abated. To the 
cafl I foon faw, about half a mile, a breach of the 
fca upon fome xocks, which caufed it again to fepa- 
rate , and as the main force drove away more fouth- 
wardly, leaving the rocks to the north-eafl, fo the 
other came back by the rcpulfeof the rocks, making 
a fharp eddy, which returned back again to the north 
weft with a very fv/ift flream. 

They who have experienced what it is to be re- 
prieved upon the ladder, or to be faved from thieves 
juft going to take away their lives, or elfe fuch who 
have been in the like calamities, may guefs my pre- 
ient exccfs of joy ; how heartily I run my boat into 
the ftrcam of this eddy, and how joyfully I fpread 
my fail to the refrefhing wind, flanding chearfully 
before it with a fmart tide under foot. By the al- 
fiftancc of this eddy, I was carried above a league 
home again, when being in the wake of the ifland, 
betwixt the two currents, 1 found the water to he 
at a fort of a frand. About four o'clock in the after- 
noon 



. [ 75 ]■ 
noon I reached within a league of the ifland, anJ 
perceived the points of the rock, which can fed this 
difafter, ftretching out as I obfcrvcd before, to the 
fouthward, which throwing off the current more 
fouthwardly, had occafioncd aitothcr eddy to the 
north. But having a fair brifk gale, I ftretchcd a- 
crofs this eddy, and in an hour came within a mile 
of the fhore, where I foon landed, to my unfpcak- 
able comfort: And after an humble prodration, 
thanking God for my deliverance, with a rcfolution 
to leave all thoughts of efcapin^ afidc, I brought my - 
boat fafe into a little cove, and laid mc down to take 
a welcome repofe. When I awoke, I vv^as confidcr- • 
ing how I might get my boat home ; ajid coafting 
along the (bore, 1 came to a gcxxl bay, which ran 
iip to a rivulet or brook, where finding a fafe har- 
bour, I flowed her as fafe as if fhc had been in a 
dry dock made on purpofe for her. 

And now I perceived myfelf not far from the place 
where before 1 had travelled on foot ; when takine; 
nothing with me except my gun and umbrella, 1 
began my journey, and in tne evening came to my 
bower, where I again laid mc down to reft. But it 
was not long before I was awakened in great fnrprife 
by a ftrange voice that called m€ fcveral times, Robirij 
Kobin^ Robin Crujoe^ Poor Robin ! TVhere are you^ 
Robin Crufoe? Woere are you? Where have you been ? 

So faft was I afleep at firft, that I did not awake 
thoroughly ; but half afleep and half awake, I 
thought 1 dreamt that fomebody fpoketo me. But as 
the voice repeated Robinfon Crufoe feveral times, be- 
ing terribly affrighted, I ftarted up in the utmoft 
confufion ; when no fooncr v/crc my eyes fully open, 
but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the 
hedge; and foon knew that it v/as he that called mc { 
for juit in fuch bewailing language I ufed to talk and 
teach him, which he fo ex aft I y learned, that he would 
iyt upon my finger, and lay his bill clofc to my face, 
G 2 and 



. t 76 ] 
and cry, Po^r Rohinfon Crufot^ ^vhere areyau f Whre 
have you heen? How camt y^u here? And fuch like ' 
prattle as I had conftantlv taught him. But as I 
knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while before 
I could adjuft myfelf 5 firft, I was amazed how the 
creature got thither, arid diat he fhoUld fix about 
that place, and no where elfe. Whpn I was aiTured 
it could be no other than my honeft Poll^ my won- 
der ceafed ; fo reaching out my hand, and calling, 
familiarly, PoU^ the creature came to me, ana 
perched upon ray thumb, as he was wont, cpnflandy 
prating to me, with Poor Robin/on Crufoe^ and Hm 
did I eome here ? and Where had I been f As if the 
bird was overjoyed to fee me ^ and fo I took him hoillr 
along with me. 

Now though I was pretty well cured of my ram- 
ming to fea again^yet I could wifh Aiy boat, which 
had coft me io much trouble and pains, on this fide 
theiiland once more, which indeed was impr^<Slica- 
blev And fo I led a very retired life, living near a 
twelvemonth, in a very contented manner, wanting 
for nothing except converfation. As to mechanic 
labours, which my neceffities obliged me to, I fan- 
cied I could, upon occafion, make a tolerable car- 
Sinter were the tools I had to work withal but good* 
efides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I con- 
trived to make them with a wheel, which I found- 
much eafier and better j making my work fhapable^ 
which before was rude and ugly. But I think I vf2A 
never fo elevated with my own performance or pro- 
jcft as for being able to make a tobacco-pipe y which 
though it proved an aukward, clumfy thing, yet»it . 
was very found, and carried the fmoak perfeftly 
well, to my great fatisfaftion. 

Alfo I improved my wicker-ware, making me a- 
tundance of neceffary bafkets, which though not very 
handfome, vere very han4y and convenient to fetch 

things 



[ 77 ] 
things home iii» as alfo for holding my flores, bar*^ 
ley, rice, and other provifions. 

My powder beginning to fail, made mc examine 
after what manner I (hould kill the goats or birds to 
live on, after it was all gone. Upon which I con- 
trived many ways to enfnarc the coats, and foe if I 
could catch them alive, particularly a {hc-go.ic with 
young. At laft I had my dcfirc ; for makijig pit- 
falls and traps, bated with barley and rice, 1 found 
one morning in one of them an old he-goat, and in 
the other three kids, one male, the other two fe- 
males. 

. So boifterous was the old one, that I could not 
bring him away. But 1 forgot the proverb, TIjat 
hunger will tame a lion : For had 1 kept him three or 
four days without victuals, and then given him 
fome water, with a little corn, he would have been 
as tame as a young kid. The other creatures I bound 
with firings together, but I had great difficulty be- 
fore I could bring them to my habitation. It was 
fome time before they would feed, when throwing 
them fome corn, it fo much tempted them, that they, 
began to be tame ; from hence i concluded, that if 
I defigned to furni(h myfelf with goats flefh, wlien 
my ammunition was fpent, the tamely breeding them, 
up like a flock of fheep about my fettlement, was the 
only method 1 could take. I concluded alfo I muil 
feparate the wild from the tame, oi clfe they would 
always run wild as they grew up; and th': belt way 
for this was to-have fome enclofed piece of ground, 
well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them 
fo efFe<flually, that thofe within might not break: out, 
or thofe without break in. Such an undertaking' 
was very great for one pair of hands ; hut as there 
was an ablolute neccliity for doing it, myiiillcare 
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there 
was likely to be hcrb:;^^' for them lo cat, water to 
drink, and cover to keep them from the fun. 

G 3 But 



, [ 78 1 
• But here I began madly, pitching upon' a piece of 
meadow land fo large, that had I enclofed it with 
infinite pains, this hedge or pale muft hzrt been at 
lead two miles about, indeed had it been ten miles 
I had time enough to do it in ; but then I did* not 
confider that my goats would be as wild in fo much 
compafs as if tney had had the whole Ifland, and 
confequently as difficult for me to catch diem. And 
this thought came intb my head, after I had carried 
on, I believe, about fifty yards ; when I rcfolved to 
enclofe a piece of ground 150 yards in- length, and 
100 in breadth, fufficient enough for as many as 
would maintain me, till fuch time as my jldck en- 
creafed, and then I could add more ground. Upoft 
which, I vigoroufly profecuted'mywork, and it took 
itie about three months in hedging the firft piece ; in 
which time I tethered the three luds in the beft parr 
df it, feeding them as near me as poffible to make 
them familiar ; and indeed very often would I carry 
feme ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feea 
them out of my hand j by virhich means they grew 
(o tame, that when my enclofure was finifhed, aiid I 
had liet them loofe, they would run ifter mc for an 
handful of corn. This indeed anfwered my end ; 
and in a year and a half's time I had a flock of about 
twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years after, 
they amounted to three and forty, befides what I had 
taken and killed for my fuftenance. After this, I 
enclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed them in, 
with penns to drive them into, that I might take 
them as I had occafion. 

But ftill I had additional bleflings, not only in 
having plenty of goats flefh, but milk too, which in 
my beginning I did not fo much as think of : And 
indeed, though I had never milked a cow, much lefs 
a goat, or feen butter cheefe made, yet after fome 
eiuys and mifcarriages I made me both, and never 
afterwards wanted. 

How 



I 79 J 

How mercifully can the omnipotent power com* 
' fort his creatures, even in the midft of their grcateft 
calamities : How can he fweetcn the bittereft Provi- 
dences, and give us reafon to magnify him in dun- 
geons and prisons ! what a bounteous table was here 
fpread in a wildcrnefs for me, when I expcdlcd no- 
thing at firft but to periih with hunger. 

Certainly a ftoic would have fmilcd to have fcen 
me at dinner ; there v^as my royal Majcfty, an abib- 
lute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by 
my dutiful fubje(fh, whom, if I plcafcd, I could ei- 
ther hang, draw, quarter, give liberty, or take it 
av^y. When. I dined, 1 fecmed a king, eating alone, 
none daring to prcfumc to do fotill 1 had done. PolL, 
as if he had been my principal court favourite, was 
the only perfon permitted to talk with me. My old 
but faithful dog, now grown exceeding crazy, and 
had found no fpecies to multiply his kind upon, con- 
tinually fat at my right hand ; while my two cats 
fat on each fide of the table, cxpe^tine a bit from my 
hand, as a principal mark of xny royal favour. Yet 
thefe were not, the cats I had brought from the 
fhip ) they had been dead long before, and interred 
sear my habitation by mine own hand : But one of 
them, as I fuppofe, generating with a wild cat, thcfe 
were the couple I haid made tame ; whereas the reft 
run into the woods, and grew fo impudent as to re- 
turn and plunder me of my ftores, till fuch time as I 
ihot a great many, and the reft left me with this at- 
tendance. And in this vcxy plentiful manner did I 
live, wanting for nothing out converfation. One 
thing mdre indeed concerned me, the want of my 
boat. I knew not which way to get her round the 
jfland. I refolved one time to go along the (hore by 
land to her j^ but had any one in England met fuch a 
figure, it would either affright them, or make thf m 
burft into laughter: Nav, my felf could not but fmile 
■ at 



»t my habit, which! think, in tlus place, it is very 
proper to defcribe. 

The cap I had upon my head wn; 'L;reat, high, and 
fhapelefs, made of a gor.t-lkin, wich a flap or pcnt- 
houfe hanging down behind, not only tp keep the 
ion from me, but to flioot the rain off from aruruiing 
into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than 
the rain falling upon the flem in thefe p.irts. I had 
a ihort jacket of goat-fkin, whofe hair hung down 
fuch a length on either fide, that it reached down to 
the caves of my legs. As for fhoes and ftockings I 
had none, but made a refemblance of fomething, I 
know not what to call them ; they were made like 
bufkins, and laced on the fides like fpatterdafhersy 
barba^oufly fhaped, like the reft of my hat^t. I had 
on me a broad belt of goat-fkin dried, girt round 
with a couple of thongs inftead of buckles ; on each' 
of which, to fupply the deficiency of fword and 
dagger, hung my hatchet and faw. I had another 
belt, not fo broad, yet fattened in the fame manner, 
which iiung over my fhoulder ; and at the end .of it^ 
under my left arm, hung two pouches, made alio dF 

f)at-ikin, to hold my powder and ihot. My baikct 
carried on my back, and my gun on my ihoulder, 
and over my head a great clumfy ugly goat-ikin 
umbrella, which, however, next my gun, was the 
moft neceflfary thing about me. . As for my face, the. 
colour was not fo fwarthy as the molattas, as might 
be expefted from fuch a perfon as I, who took fo 
little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten de- 
grees from the equinox. At one time my beard grew 
fo fong, that it hung down above a quarter of a 
yard ; but as I had • both razors and fciiTars in ftore, 
1 cut it all off, . and fufFered none to grow, except a 
large pair of Mahometan whifkers, the like of v.»hich 
I had feen worn by fome Turks at Sallee^ not long 
enough to hang a hat upon* but of fuch a raon- 

ftrous 



[ 8i ] 
ftrous Hze^ as would have amazed any in England ti> 
have feen. 

'But all this was of no confequencc here, theic 
beinf none to obferve my behaviour or habit. And 
fo without^ar, and without controul, I proceeded 
on my journey, the profccution of which took me up 
five or fix davs. I firft travelled along the fea-fliore, 
AiTc&lj '^^ ^"^ place where I firft broueht my boat 
to an anchor, to get upon the rocks. But now ha- 
ving no boat to take care of, I went over the land a 
nearer way, to the fame heighth that I was before 
upon ; when looking forward to the point of the 
r6ck which lay out, and which I was forced to dou- 
ble with my boat, I was amazed to fee the fea fo 
fmooth and quiet, there being no ripling, motion^ or 
(>ttiTent, any more than in other places : Which 
made me indeed ponder fome time to imagine the 
reafon of it, when at laft I was convinced how it was, 
which was this y the ebb fetting from the weft, and 
joining with the currents of waters from fomc ereat 
rivers on the fhore, muft be the occafion of theie ra- 
pid ftreams \ and that confequently as the winds blew 
more weftwardly,or more fouthwardly, fo the current 
came the hearer, or went the further from fhore. To 
fatisfy my curiofity, I waited there till evening, when 
the tide of ebb being made, from the rock 1 plainly 
perceived the current again as before, with this dif- 
ference, that it ran farther off, near half a leagme from 
the fhore; whereas in my condition, it fet quite upon 
it, furioufly hurrying me and my canoe along with 
it, which at another time it would not have done. 
And now I was convinced that, by obferving the 
ebbing and flowing of the tide, I might eafily bring 
my boat round the ifland again : But when I begun to 
think of putting it in praftice, the remembrance of the 
late danger I was in uruck me with fuch horror, that 
I changed my refolution, which was more fafe, tho* 

moTQ 



[ 82 I . 
more laborious ; and this wasto make another canoe, 
and fo have one for one fide of the ifland, and one 
for the other. 

Here I think it very prc^r to inform my readers, 
that I had two plantations in the ifland ; the firft was 
my little fortification, fort, or caftle, with many 
large and fpacious improvements : For by this time 
I had enlarged the cave behind me with feveral little 
caves, one within another, to hold my bafkets, 
corn and flraw. The piles with which I made my 
wall were grown fo lofty and great, as obfcured my 
habitation : And near this commodious and pleafant 
iettlemcnt lay my two well cultivated ^and improved 
corn fields, which kindly yielded n^e their fruit in 
the proper feafon. My fccond plantation was that 
near my countrv feat, or little bower, where my 
grapes nourifhea, and where, having planted many 
flakes, I made enclofures for my goats, fo ftronglv 
fortified by labour and time, that it was mucn 
ilrongcr than a wall, and confequently impoffible 
for them to break through. As for my Dower itfelf, 
I kept it conftantly in repair, and cut the trees- in 
fuch a hianner as made them grow thick and wild, 
and form the mofl delightful fhade. In the . center 
of this flood my tent, thus ereftcd : I had driven four 
piles in the ground, fpreading over them a piece. of 
the fhip's fail 5 beneath which Tmade me a fort of a 
couch with the fkins of the creatures I had flain, 
and other things ; and having laid thereon one of the 
failors blankets, \«hich I had faved from the wreck 
of the fnip, iuicl covering myfelf with a great watch- 
coat, I took up this place for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe*^to 
vifit my boat, and kept her in very good order. And 
fometimesi would venture in her a cafl or two from 
fhorc, but no farther, left either a flrong current, a 
fuddcn flormy v/inci, or fome unlucky accident, 
fhould hurry me from the ifland as before. But now 

I 



[ 83 ] 

I entreat your attention, while I proceed to inform 
you of a new but moft furprirmt; fcenc of life, 
wherein I was afting r.garn in a ftran^cr manner. 

You may fuppoib that, after 1 had been here fo 
long, nothing could have hzcn more amazing than to 
Jhave feen a human creature. But one day it hap- 
pened that, going to my boat, I faw the print of a 
man's naked foot on the (hore, very evident on the 
fand, as thet0L*s, heel, and every part of it. Had 
I feen an appariti-n^ in the moft frightful manner, I 
could not have bceji :^i >r confounded : My willing 
ears gave the ftridtcft attention. I cait my eyes a- 
round, but neicncr could futisfy the one or the other. 
When I proceeded alternately to every part of the 
ihore, ftill it was all a^. one ; neither could 1 fee any 
other mark, though the fand about it was as fufcepti- 
ble to take imprcfiion as that which was lb plainly 
ftampt. Thus, ft ruck with confufion and horror, I 
returned to my habitation, frightened at every bufh 
and tree, as taking them for men ; and, K'ing pof- 
{effod with the wiTdeft ideas, got over i caiuiot tell 
how. But that night my eyes never clofcd, though 
farther from danger, when even then I formed nothing 
but the moft difmal imaginations, thinking it muft be 
the mark of tl>e Devil's foot which I had fccn : For 
otherwife how could any mortal body come to this 
Iftand ? And if fo, where was the fliip that tranfport- 
ed them ? And what figns of any other footfteps ? 
Though thcfe fecmed very ftrong rcafons for fuch a 
fuppofition, yet (thought J) why fhould the Devil 
make the print of his foot to no purpofe, as I can fee, 
when he might have taken other ways to have terri- 
fied me ? Why fhould he leave his mark on ilic other 
iide of the ifland, and that too on the fand, where 
the furging waves of the ocean might foon have 
erafed the impreflion. Surely this a<Sion is not con- 
fiftant with the fubtlety of SATAN, faid I to my- 
felfi but rather muft be fome dangerous creature, 

fome 



I 



[ 84 ] 

fooK wild £ivage of the main land- over againft m% 
that, venturing too far in the ocean, was driven here 
either by the violent currents or contrary winds ; 
and fo not caring to ftay on this defolate Ifland, was 
gone hack to fea again. 

Happv was I in my dioughts diat no (avages had 
feen me m that place, yet much terfified, left, having 
found my hoat, they fliould return in numbers and 
deftroy me, or at leaft carry away all my com, and 
deftroy my flock of tame goats : In a word, all my 
reli^ous hopes vaniflied, as though I thought Goa 
could not proteA me by his power, who had fo won- 
derfully preferved it fb long. 

What various chains of Providence there are in the 
life of man ! How changeable are our affe^ions, ac- 
cording to different circumftances f We love to- 
day what we hate to-morrow ; we fhun one hour what 
we feek the next ; and this was evident in me in the 
moft perfpicuous manner ; for I, who before had fb 
much lamented my condition, in being bani&ed {rom 
all human kind, was now almoft readv to expire, when 
I confidered that a man had fet his foot on this defo- 
late Ifland. But when I confidered my flation of 
life, decreed by the infinitely wife and good Providence 
of God ; that 1 ought not to difpute my Creator's fove- 
Teignty, who had an undoubted right to govern and 
difpofe of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and 
that his juflice and mercy could either punifh or deli- 
ver me : I fay when I confidered all this, I coixifortably 
found it my duty to trull fincerely in him, pray ardently 
to him, and humbly refign myfelf to his divine will. 

One morning, lying on my bed, thefe words of thfe 
facred writings came again into my mind. Call upim 
me in the day of trouble^ and I will deliver thee^ and 
thou Jhalt glorijy me. Upon this fentence, rifing more 
chearfully from my bed, I offered up my prayers in 
the mofl heavenly manner : And when I had done, ta- 
king up my Bible to read, thefe words appeared firft in 
my fight : Wait m, the L^rd^ and he of good cheer^ 

and 



[ 85 1 

and he Jhatt Jlnngthen tlyy heart ; watt^ I fay^ on the 
Lard. Such diving comfort did this give me, as to 
remove all caufe of fadnefs upon that occafion. 

Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fcarj, 
for three days and nights, at laft I ventured out of 
my caftlc, and milked my goats, one of which was 
almoft fpoiled for want ot it. I next, though in 

S-eat fear) vifited my bower, and milked mv flocks 
ere alfo ; when growing bolder, I went down to 
the (hore again, and meafuring the print of the foot 
to mine, to fee whether, perhaps, 1 myfelf had not 
occafioned that mark, I found it much fupcriorin 
largenefs ; and fo I returned home, pofTcircd with 
the notion, that either fomc men had been afhore, 
or that the ifland muft be inhabited ; and therefore, 
that I might be furprifed before I was aware. 

Struck with a fecond and more terrible fear, fcvc- 
ral thoughts of fccurity came into my mind : And 
that night I was firft propofmg to cut down my en- 
clofurcs, and turn my tame cattle wild into the 
woods, that the encmv might not find them, and 
frequent the ifland i/i hopes of the fame. Secondly^ I 
was for digging up my corn fields for the very fame 
reafon: And, Lajlly^ I concluded to demolifh my 
bower, left, feeing fuch a place of human contrivance, 
they might come farther and attack me in my little 
caftle. 

Such notions did the fear of danger fuggcft unto 
me ; and, I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate 
King 5^K/,when not only opprefs'd by the PhilijUneSy 
but alfo forfaken by God himfelf : And it is ftrange, 
that a little before having entirely refigncd myfelf to 
the will of God, I fhould now have fo little confi- 
dence in him, fearing thofe more who might kill 
this fading body, than him who could deftroy my 
immortal foul. 

Sleep was an utter ftranger to my eyes that night; 

yet nature, fpcnt and tired, fubmittca tQ a filent re- 

H pofc 



f-86 ] 

pofe the next morning : and then, joining reafon 
with my fear, I confidered, that this delightful and 
pleafant iAand might not be entirely forfaken, as t 
might think; or that the inhabitants from the other 
Ihore might fail either with defign or neceflity, by 
crofs winds ; and if the latter circumftancc, they de- 
parted upon the firft opportunity. But flill my fear 
Qccafioned me to think of a place for retreat, upon an 
attack. I now repented that I had made the door 
that came out beyond my fortification ; but- refol- 
ving to make me a fecond, I drove between that dou- 
ble row of trees, which I planted about 12 years be- 
fore, feveral piles, thickening it with pieces of tim- 
ber and old cables, and ilrengthening the foot of it 
with earth which I dug out of my cave- I alfo made 
me feven holes, wherein I planted my mufkets like 
cannon, fitting them into frames refembling carria- 
ges. This being finiflied with indefatigable induftry, 
for a great way every way I planted flicks of ofier- 
like wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving 
a large fpace between them and my wall, that I might 
have room to fee an enemy, and that they might not 
be fheltered from the young trees, if they oiiered to 
approach the outer wall. And indeed fcarce two 
years had paffed over my head^ when there appeared 
a lovely ftiady grove, and in fix years it became a 
thick wood perfectly impaflable. For my fafety, I 
left no avenue to go in or out ; inftead of which 1 fet 
two ladders ; one to a part of the rock which was 
low, and then broke in, leaving room to plac^ ano- 
ther ladder upon that; fo that when I took thofe 
down, it was impofliblefor any man to defccnd without 
hurting himfelf ; and if they had, they would ftill be 
;it the outfide of my outer wall. But while I took 
all thefe meafures of human prudence for my own 
prefervation, I was altogether unmindful of other 
aftairs : To preferve my flocks of tame goats, that 
the enemy ihould not take all at once, I looked out 

for 



r 87 ] 

for the moft retired part of the ifiand, whicli was the 
place where 1 had loft myfelf before-mentioned, and 
there finding a clear piece of land, containin;:: three 
acres, furroundcd with thick wood^, i v/orktd fo 
hard, that in lefs.than a month's time I fenced it fr> 
weir round, that my flocks were very well lieu red in 
it, putting therein two hc-goats and ten ftie ones. 

As this labour was occafioned purely by my ft-ar- 
ful apprehenfions, on account of feeing the print of 
a man's foot j not contented with what I had done, 
I fcarched for another place towards the we it point* 
of the ifland, where I might alfo retain nnothcr flock, 
Thenmethought I perceived a boat at a great diftancc 
in the fea; but could not poflibly tell what it was for 
want of my pcrfpedtive clafs. I confidered then \t 
was noftran^ thing to fee the print of a man's foot; 
and concludmg them cannibals, bleflfcd God for my 
being caft on the other fide of the ifland, where none 
of the favages, as I thought, ever came. But when 
I came down the hill to the fliore, which was the S. W. 
point of the ifland, I was not only amazed, but 
perfectly confirmed in my opinion : For the place 
was fpreadwith fculls, hands, feet, and bones of hu- 
man bodies; and then I perceived a Ibacc like a cir- 
cle, in the midft of which had been anre; about thi» 
fire I conjeftured thefc wretches fat, and unnaturally 
facrificed and devoured their fellow creatures. 

The horror and loathfomenefs of this dreadful 
rpe<Elacle both confounded my fenfes, and made mc 
difcharge the violent diforder from my ftomach. So 
that when I had vomited in a very exceflivc manner, 
I returned towards my habitation ; and in my way 
thither fhedding floods of tears, and falling down oit 
my bended knees, gave God thanks for making my 
nature contrary to thefe wretches, and delivering me 
fo long out of their hands. 

Now though rcafon and my long refidence there 

had aifured me, that theie favages never came up to 

H z the 



t 88 1 
the thick woody parts of the country ; and tKat I had 
no occafion to difcover myfelf, who was fo perfedly 
concealed from them^ yet fuch an aUiorence did] 
fiill retain, that for two years after I confined myfelf 
only td my three plantations ; I mean my cdUe, 
country feat, and ench)fur)S in the woods. And 
when, in this folitary life, my dreadful apprehenlions 
began to wear away, yet my eyes were more vigilant 
for fear of being furprized, and I was cautious of 
firing my gun, left, being heard by thofe creatures, 
they fhould proceed to attack me; but refolving 
manfully to lofe my life if they did, I went armed 
with three piftols ftuck in my girdle, which added 
to the defcription I have given of myfelf before, made 
me look with a very formidable appearance. 

And thus my circumftances for fome time ire* 
mained very calm and undifhu-bed. When I com- 
pared my condition to others, I found it fsuc from 
being miferable ; And indeed would all perfons com-^ 
pare their circlrumflances, not with thofe aboye'them, 
but with thofe innumerable unhappy obje&s beneath 
them, I am fure we (hould not hear thofe daily mur* 
murings and complainings that are in the world. For 
my part, I did not want many things : Indeed the 
terror which the favages had put me in fpoilt fome 
inventions for my own conveniencies ; one of which 
'^^ was really very ridiculous, except I could accompliib 
it, and happy it was they hindered me from putting 
it in praftice. My defign was to brew me fome beer, 
when I had neither ca^s fufficient, nor could make 
any, to preferve it in ; neither had I hops to m^e it 
keep, yeaft to make it work, nor a "copper or kettle 
to make it boil. Perhaps indeed, after fome years, 
1 might bring this to bear, as I had done other things : 
But now my inventions were placed another way j 
and one v/as, how I might deftioy fome of thefe can- 
nibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertain- 
ments 3 and io faving a vi^m from being facrificed, 

he 



t 89 1 

he might after became my fcrvant. Many were my 
contrivances for this purpofc, and as maiw more ob- 
jedlions occurred after I hatched them : For when I 
contrived to dig a hole under the place where they 
made their fire, and put therein five or fix pounds of 
gunpowder, which would confequently blow up all 
thofe that were near it; whythen*! was loth to fpend 
fo much upon them, left it fhould not do that certain 
execution I could defire; and but only aAright, and 
not kill them. Having laid this defign afide, 1 pro- 
pofed to myfelf to lay privately in ambulh, in fome 
convenient place, with my three guns double loaded, 
and let fly at them in the midft of their dreadful cere- 
mony; and having killed two or three of them at 
tVQXy fhot, fall upon the reft fuddenly with my three 
piftols, and not let one mother's fon efcapc. And fo 
much did this imagination pleafe my fancy, that I ufod 
to dream of it in the night-time. To put my defiju . 
in execution, I was not long feeking for a place very . 
convenient for my purpofc, where, unfcei), 1 niight 
behold every aftion of the favages. Here i placed my 
two mufkets, each of which was loaded with a brace . 
of flugs, and four or five fmaller bullcta, about the 
fize of piftol-bullets ; the fowling-piccer was charg;cd 
with near a handful of the largd^ fwan-fhot ; and in 
every piftol were about four bullets. And thus all 
things being "prepared, no fooner would the welcome 
light fpread over the element, but, like a giant refreflj^ 
id with wine, as the Scripture has it, would 1 iflue 
forth from my caflle, and, frgm a lofty hill, three 
miles diftant, view if I could Jce any invaders ap- 
proach unlawfully to my kingdom. But having 
waited in vain two or three months, it not only grew 
very tirefome to me, but brought me into feme con- 
fideration, and made me examine myfelf, what right 
I had to kill thefe creatures in this manner ? 

If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cuftom of 

theirs be ^im offenfive to heaven, it belongs to the 

H 3 Divine 



[ 90 ] . 
Divine Bcine9 vrho alone has the vindidive power in 
his hands to mower down vengeance upon them : And 
perhaps he does A>, in making them become one an« 
other's executioners. Or if not, if God diinks thefe 
doings juft, according to the knowledge which they 
conceive, what auth9rity have I to pretend to ail the 
decrees of Providence, which has permitted thefe ac- 
tions for fo many ages, perhaps from almoft the be« 
ginning of the creation ? They never ofFended me, 
what right had I then to concern myklf in their 
ihedding one another's blood i And, as I have fince 
known, they value no more to kill and devour a cap- 
tive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox, or eat 
mutton. From hence it followed, that thefe people 
were no more murderers than Chriftians, who many 
times put whole troops to the fword, after throwing 
down their arms. Again I confidered, that if I fell 
upon them, I (houldbe as much in the wrong as the 
Spaniards yVfho had committed the greateft barbarities 
upon thefe people, who had never offended them in 
their whole lives ; as if the kingdom of Spain was emi- 
nent for 9, race of men without common companion 
to the miferable, which is reckoned to be a principal 
lign of the moft generous temper. In a word, I con- 
^ eluded never to attack them, whofe numbers might 
overpower me ; or that fome efcaping, might bring 
thoufands to my certain deftrud:ion, not fo much as . 
to fhew myfelf, which might oblige me even to a 
neceffary duty of defence. And indeed religion took 
their part fo much as to convince me how contrary 
it was to my duty to be guilty of (bedding human 
blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they 
are to one another; and that I had nothing to do 
with it but leave it to the God of all power and domi- 
nion, as I faid before, to do therein what feeraed con-^ 
venicnt to his heavenly wifdom. And therefore, on 
my knees, I thanked the Almighty for delivering me 
from blood-guiltiners^ and begged his pXQteAion that 
I might never fall into their hands. Thus, 



[ 91 1 
Thus, giving over an attempt which I had ndhlr 
begun, 1 never afcendetl the hill on that occafion aN 
terwards ; only I removed my boat which lay on the 
other fide of^ the ifland, and every thing, fuch as they 
were, that beldnged to her, towards the eail, into a 
little cove, that there might not be the leall ihadow 
of difcovcryof any boat near, or habitation upon the 
ifland. And then mycaftie bbcamemy cell, keeping 
very retired in it, except to milk my Ihc-goats, and 
order my little flock in the wood, which was quite 
out of danger ; for fure it is, thefe favages never 
came here with expcAations to find any tbin^, and 
confequcntly never wandered from the coaft^ and M 
they might have feveral times been on Oiore, as well 
before as after my dreadful apprehenfions, I looked 
back With horror to think in what a ftate I might 
have been, had i fuddenly met them (lender! y armed^ 
with one gun only loaded with fmall fhot : And hovr 
great would have been my amazement, if, inltead 
of feeing the print of one man's foot I had perceived 
fifteen or twenty favages, who, having once fet their 
eyes upon me, by the fwiftnefs of their feet, there 
was no poilibility of my efcaping i 7'heie thoughts 
would fink my very foul within me, fo that I would 
fall into a deep melancholy, till fuch ;ime as the 
Confideration of my gratitude to the Divine Being 
moved it from my heart. And th6n I fell into a con-« 
temptation of the fecret fprings of Providence : How 
wonderfully we are delivered, when we are inienfible 
of it ; and when intricated in uncertain mazes or la- 
byrinths of doubt or heiitation, what fecret hint ihall 
direct us in the right way, when we intended tp go 
out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our bufmefs, 
fenfe, or inclination. Upon which, i fixed within 
me this as a certain rule, never to difobeythofe fecret 
impreilions of my mind to the adting or not ailing 
any thing that offered, for which I yet could affign 
no reafon : But let it be how it will; the advantage of 

this

I 






[ 92 ] 

this conduct very eminently appeared in the latter part 
of my abode on this ifland : I am a ftranger in deter- 
mining whence thefe fecret intimations of Providence 
derive ; yet, methinks, they are,not only fome proofs of 
the converfe of fpirits, but alfo of the fecret commu- 
nications they are fuppofed to have with thofe that 
have not paffed through the gloomy vale of death. 

As in thefe many anxieties of mind, the care of 
mj prefervation put a 'period to all inventions and 
contrivances, either for future accommodations or 
conveniencies j fo I never cared to drive a nail, chop 
a ftick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lelt either the noife 
ihould be heard, or the fmoak difcover nie : And, 
upon this account, I ufed to burn my earthen ware 
privately in a cave which I found in the wood, and 
which 1 made convenient for that purpofe : But the 
principal caufe that firft brought me here was to 
make charcoal, fo that I might bake and drefs my 
bread and meat, withput any danger. While I was 
cutting down fome wood for this purpofe, I percei- 
ved a cavity behind a very thick branch of under- 
wood. Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth, 
and perceived it fufficient for me to ftand upright in 
it. But when I had entered and took a further view, 
two rowling fhiningeyes, like flaming ftars, feemed 
to dart themfelves at me, fo that I made all the hafte 
out that I could^ as not knov;ing whether it was the 
Devil or a monfter that had taken his refidence in 
that place. But when I recovered from my furprize, 
I called myfelf a thoufand fools, for being afraid to 
fee the Devil one moment, who had now lived al- 
moft twenty years in the moft retired folitude : 
And therefore, refuming all the courage 1 had, I 
took up a flaming firebrand, and in I rulhed again; 
when not having proceeded above three fteps, I 
was more affrighted than before ; for then I heard 
a very loud figh, like that of a human creature in 
the grcateft agony, fucceeded with a broken noifcy 

refembling 



[ 93 ] 
refembling words half exprcflcd, and then a broken 
figh again. Stepping back. Lord ! (thought I to 
myfelf) where am 1 got? Into what enchanted place 
have I plunged myfelf, fuch as are reported to con- 
tain miferable captives, till death puts an end to their 
forrow ? And indeed, {uch a great amazement was I 
in, that it ftruck me with a cold fweat ; and had my 
hat been on my head, I believe my hair would have 
moved it off. But again, encouraging myfelf with 
the hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward^ 
and, by the light of my firebrand, perceived it to be 
a monftrous he-goat, lying on the ground, gafpins 
for life, and dying of mere old age. When at firft 1 
ftirred him, thinking to drive him but, the poor an- 
cient creature ftrove to get upon his feet, but was not 
able ; fo I e'en let him Itay ilill, to affright the fava- 
, ges, fhould they venture into this cave. In the mean 
time, I looked round me, and found the place but 
fmall and ihapclefs : At thcfurther fide of it I per- 
ceived a fort of an entrance, yet fo low as muft 
oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to it ; 
when, having no candle, I fufpended my enterprize 
till the next day, and then I came provided with fix 
large ones of my own making. 

When, upon my hands and feet I had crept thro* 
the ftraight, 1 found the roof rofe higher up, I think, 
about twenty feet : But furcly never mortal faw fuch 
a glorious fight in this ifland before ! The roof and 
walls of this cave refledtcd a hundred thoufand lights 
to ftie from my tjvo candles, as though they were 
indented in with fhining gold, precious ftones, or 
fparkling diamondsv And indeed it v\as the moft 
delightful cavity or grotto, of its kind, as could be 
dcfired, though entirely dark: The floor was dry 
and level, and had a kind of gravel upon it ; no 
naufcous venemous creature to be feen there, nei- 
ther any damp or wet about it : I could find no 
fault but in the entrance, which I thought might be 

very 



[ 94 ] 
very necefiaiy for mvdcfence, and therefore was re« 
Mved to nakc this place my moft principal maga- 
zinc. I brought hither two fowling-pieces and tluw 
mufkets, leaving only five pieces at my caftle, plant- 
ed in the nature of cannon. Jn a barrel of gun* 
powder, which I took out (^ the fea, I brought away 
about fixty pounds of gckxl powder, which was not 
damaged ; and thefe, with a great quantity of lead 
for bullets, I removed from my caftle to this retreat, 
now fortified both by art and nature. 

Surely it is no u onder, if at this time I thought 
myfelf like one of the giants of old, who were faid to 
live in caves and holes among the rocks, inacceflible 
to any but themfelves, or, at lead, moft dangerous to 
attempt. So that now it feems I defpifed both the 
cunning and ftrength of the favages, either to find 
me out or to hurt me. 

But I muft not forget the old goat, who caufed 
my late dreadful amazement : The poor creature 
gave up the ^hoft the day after my difcovery ; and it 
being difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and 
honourably entombed him in the fame place where 
he departed, with as much ceremony as any ff^el/h 

foat that has been interred about the high mountain 
^enmenmoure. 
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of my 
reign, and much eafler were my tnoughts than for- 
merly, contriving feveral pretty amufements and di- 
verfions, to pafs away the time in a pleafant manner. 
By this time my pretty Poll had learnt to fpeak Eng- 
lijhy and pronounce nis words very articulately and 
plain ; fo that for many hours we ufed to chat toge- 
ther after a vtry familiar manner, and he lived with 
mc no lefs than twenty-fix years : My dog, who Mras 
nineteen years old, iixteen years of which he lived 
with me, died of mere old age: As for my cats, 
they multiplied fo faft, that I was forced to kill or 
drive them into the woods, except two or three, 

which

which became my particular favourites. BefiJcB 
thcfc, I continually kept two or three houfchold Icicle 
about me Vhich I did learn to feed out of my hand, 
and two more parrots which would talk indlH'crcntly, 
and call Robinfon Crufot^ but not fo excellent as the 
firft, as not taking that pains with them. Several 
fea fowls I had alio, which having wounded, I cue 
their wings, and growing tame, they ufcd to breed 
among the low trees about my caftle walls ; all which 
were very agreeable to me. 

But what unforcfeen events fuddenly deftroy the 
enjoyments of this uncertain ftatc of life, when wc 
leaft expeft them ! It was now the month of Dectm* 
her^ in the Southern folftice, and particular time of 
my harveft, which required my attendance in the 
fields,; when going out pretty early one morning, 
before it was day-fight, there appeared to me, from 
the fea-fhore, aflamme light, about two miles from 
me, at the eaft end of the ifland, where I had ob- 
ferved fome favages had been, as before, but not on 
the other fide j but, to my great affliftion, it was on 
my fide of the ifland. 

Struck with a terrible furprifc, and my ufual ap- 
prchcnfions, that the favages would perceive my im- 
provements, I returned direftly to my cafUc, pulled 
up the ladder after me, making all things look, as 
wild and natural as poffibly 1 could. In the next 
place I put myfelf in a pofturc of defence, by loading 
my muikets and piftols, and committing myfcif to 
God's proteftion, refolving to defend myfcif till my 
lateft breath. After two hours fpacc, impatient for 
intelligence, I fet my ladder up to the fide of the 
hill where there was a flat place ; and then pulling 
the ladder after me, afcended the top, wiiere, hiying 
myfelf on my belly, with my perrpe(iHve glafs, I 
perceived no Icfs than nine naked favages, fitting 
round a fmall fire, eating, as I fuppofcd, human 
flefh, with their two canoes haled upon (bore, wait- 
ing 



[ 96 ] 
ing for the flood-to carry them off again. You can-* 
noteaiilvexprefs theconftemation I was in at this fight 
efpecially feeing them near me ; but when I perceived 
their coming muft be always with the current of the 
ebb, I became more ea(y in my thoughts, being ve- 
ry fully convinced, that I might go abroad with Sca- 
nty all the time of flood, if they were not before 
landed. And indeed this proved juft as I imagined ; 
for no fooner did they all take boat, and paddle away, 
but the tide made north^weft. Before they went 
ofl^, they danced, making ridiculous poihires and 
geftures, for above an hour, all ftark naked, but 
whether men, or women, or both, I could not per- 
ceive. When I iaw them gone, I took two guns upon 
my (boulders, and placing a couple of piffols in my 
belt, with my great fword hanging by my fide, I 
went to the hill, where at firft I made a aifcovery 
of thefe cannibals, and then faw there had been three 
canoes more of the favages on fhore at that place, 
which, with the reft, were making over to the maiii 
land. 

But nothing could be more horrid to me, when go* 
ing to the place of facrifice, the blood, the bones, 
and other mangled parts of human bodies, appeared in 
my fight ; and fo, fifed with indignation, I was fully 
refolved to be revenged of the firft that came there, 
tho' I loft my life in the execution. It then appeared 
to me that the vifits, which they make to this Ifland, 
were not very frequent, it being fifteen months before 
they came again ; all this time I was very uneafy, 
by reafon of the difmal apprehenfions I had of their 
furprifing me unawares : nor dared I offer to fire a 
gun on that fide of the ifland where they ufed to ap- 
pear, left, taking the alarm, the favages might re- 
turn with many hundred canoes, and then God Icnows 
in what manner I fhould have made my end : And 
thus I was a year or niore, before I ever faw any of 
thefe devouring cannibals again. 

But 



[ 97 1 

But to wave this difcour&fora while, the follow- 
ing accident demands your attention, which for a 
while eluded the force of my thoughts in revenging 
myfclf on thofc heathens. 

It was the i6th of May (according to my wooden 
calendar) that the wind blew exceeding hard, accom- 
panied with abundance of lightnhig and thunder all 
that day, and fucceeded by a very ftormy night. 
What occafioned this I could not imagine ; but as 
the fecming anger of the heavens made me have rc- 
courfe to the Bible, whilft I was ferioufly pondering 
upon it, I was fuddenly alarmed with the noife of n 

?ijn,r which I conjectured was fired upon the ocean, 
uch an unufual lurprize made me ftart up in a mi* 
nute, when, with my ladder, afccnding the moun- 
tain as before, that very moment a flam of fire pre- 
faged the report of another gun» which I prefcntl^- 
heard, and found it was from tnat part of the fea 
where the current drove me away. I could not theti 
think otherwife, but that this muft be a fliip in dif- 
trefs, and that thefe were the melancholy fi(rnals for 
a fpeedy deliverance. Indeed, great was my forrow, 
upon this occafion, but altogether vain and friiitlefs. 
However, I brought together all the dry wood that 
was at hand, and, making a handfomc pile, fet it on 
fire on the hill. Certain it was, that they plainly 
4)erceived it, by their firing another gun, as foon as 
it began to blaze, and after that feverul more from the 
fame quarter. AH the night long did I keep up this 
fire J and when the air cleared up, I perceived fomc- 
thing a great way at fea diredlly eaft, but could not 
dillinguifli what it was, even with my glafs, by rea- 
fon the weather was fo very fo»gy out at fea. How* 
ever, keeping my eyes directly nxt upon it, and per- 
ceiving it not to ftir, I prefcntly concluded it muft be 
a fliip at anchor : And fo very hafty I was to be fa- 
tisfied^ that, taking my gun, I went to the fouth-eaft 
I part 



C 98 1 
pfirt of tbe ifbadyto the lame rocks where I had been 
iornxzh diotc anj by the current; in which time 
the wcaiihcr being perfectiy cleared up, to my great 
fcrrow, i pcrcdved the wreck of a fliip cait away 
ispoD thole hidden rocks, which 1 found uhen I was 
o;:t with my boat ; and which, by making a kind of 
an eddy, woe the occafion of my prefervation. 

Tlius, ysiat is one man's fiifety is another's ruin : 
For undoubtedly this fliip had been driven on them 
in the night, the wind blowing ftrong at £. N. £. 
Now, had they perceived the iiland, as I could not 
imagine they did, certain!/, inftead of firing their 
guns for help, they might rather have ventured in 
dieir boat, aiKi (aved diemfelves that way. Then I 
thought, that perhaps they had done fo, upon feeine 
my nre, and were caft away in the attempt ; for I 
.perceived no boat in the fhip. Again, I imagined, 
that perhaps tiiey had another vefiel in company, 
which, upon fignal, faved their lives, and took the 
boat up : Or laftly, that the boat might be driven 
into the main ocean, where thefe poor creatures 
might be in the moft miferable condition. But as all 
thefe conje6tures were very uncertain, I could do 
no more than cpmiriiferate their diftrefs, and thank 
God for delivering me, in particular, when fo many 
pcriflied in the raging ocean. 

When I confidored ferioufly every thing concern- 
ing til is wreck, 1 could perceive no room to fuppofe 
any of them faved : I cannot explain, by any poilible 
force of words, v/hat longings my foiil felt upon this « 
figlit, often breaking out -n this manner: Oh ! that 
there had bct*n but two or threc^ nay even one perfon 
faved, that v/c might have lived together, converfed 
with and comforted one another ! And fo much were 
mv dclires moved, that when J repeated thefe words; 
O'.' / tbut there had hen: but one I my hands would

twcen, ,they Would have cruiheS'it involuntarily; 
while my teeth would ftribe together, and fet againft 
each other fo ftrong, that it required fome time for 
me to part them. 

Till the laft year of my being on this ifland, I ne- 
ver knew if any had been faved out of this fhip or 
not ; and had only the affliction feme time after, to 
lee the corpfe of a drowned boy come on (bore, at the 
end of the ifland, which was next the fhipwrcck : 
There was nothing on him but a fcamsin's waiftcoat, 
a pair of open-knee'd linnen drawers, and a blue 
linnen fhirt ; but no particular mark to gucfs what 
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of 
eight and a tobacco-pipe, the laft of which I pcr- 
feri-ed much more than I did the firft. And now the 
calmne&ofthe fea tempted, me to venture out in mv 
boat to thi? wreck, not only to get fomething ncceU 
fary out of the (hip, biit perhaps fome living creature 
might be on board, whofe life I mieht prefcrve. This 
hadfuch an influence upon my mind, that immediate- 
ly I went home, and prepared every thing Dcceflary 
for the voyage, carrying on board my boat, provifions 
of all forts, with a good quantity of rum, frefli wa- 
ter, and a compafs. So putting off, I paddled the 
canoe along the fhore, till I came at laft to the N.E. 
part of the \flancl, from whence I was to launch int* 
the ocean ; but here the currents run fo violently, 
and appeared fo terrible, that my heart began to fail 
me i forefceing that if I was driven into any of (hcfe 
currents, I might be carried not only out of the 
reach or fight of the ifland, but even inevitably loft 
in the boiling furges of the ocean. 

So oppreffed was I at thefe troubles, that I gave 
over my enterprize, failing to a little creek on the 
ftiore, where ftepping out, i fat me down on a rifing 
hill, very penfive and thoughtful. I then perceived, 
that the tide was turned, an J the flood came on, which 
made it impadticable for nie to go out for fo many 
i 2 hours. 



noun. To be more certain, how the fete of tbc 
tides or currents Jay when the flood came iiiy I af- 
cended a higher piece of ground^ which overlooked 
the fea both ways, and here I founds that as the 
current of the ebb fet out clo/e by the fouth point 
of the ifland, fo the current of the flood fet in clofe 
by the flioie of the north fide ; and all that I had 
to do, was, to keep to the north of the iiland in mj 
return. 

That night Irepofcd my feJf in my canoe, covered 
With mv watch coat inftead of a blanket, the hea- 
vens being my tcfter. I iet out with the firft of the 
tide full north, till I felt the benefit of the current, ' 
whicJi earned me at a great rate eaiilward, yet not 
with fuch impetuofity as before, as to take from me 
Sill government of my canoe ; fa that in two hours 
time I came up to the wreck, which appeared to me 
in a moft melancholy manner. It feexne^ to be a

waves. There were feveral calks of licjuor. Whe- 
ther wine or brandy, I could not be pofitive, whicR 
lay in the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by 
the ebbing out of the water, yet were two large for 
me to pretend to meddle with : Likcwifc I perceived 
feveral chefts, which I thought might belong to the 
feamen ; two of them I got into my boat, withoOt 
examining then what were in them. Now had the 
ftern of the fhip been fixed, and the fore-part bro^ 
ken ofF, certain I am I (hould have made a very pros- 
perous voyage ; flnce by what I after found m thcfe 
two chefts, 1 could nototherwife conclude, but that 
the (hip muft have abundance of wealth on board i. 
nay, if I mUft euefs by the courfe (he fteered, fhe 
muft have been bound from the Btunos Ayrts or the 
. Ri9 di la Platay in the fouthern part of Ammcay be-* 
yond the BrajUsy to the Havanahj in the gulph of 
Mexicoy and fo perhaps to Spain. What b^ame of 
the reft of her failors, I could not certainly tell ; . 
and all her riches fignified nothing at that time to 
any body. 

Searcnin^ farther, I found a cafk, containing about 
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which with feme 
labour I got into my boat : In a cabin were feveral 
mufkets, which I let remain there, but took away 
with me a great powder-horn^ with about four pounds 
of powder in it ; I took alfo a fire-fhovel and tongs, 
two brafs kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, 
and a grid-iron, all wMck were extreamly neceflary 
to me, efpecially the fire-lhovel and tongs. And 
io with this cargo, accompanied with my dpg, 1 
came away, the tide ferving for that purpofe \ and 
that the fame evening, about an hour within night, 
1 attained the ifland, after the greateft toil and fa- 
tigue imaginable. 

That night I repofcd my wearied limbs in the 

boat, refolving the next morning to harbour what 

i had gotten in my new. found fubtcrraneous grotto^

and not cany my cargo home to my antient cafUe* 
When I had refrelhed myfelf, and got all my 
efFcds on fhore, I proceeded to examine the parti- 
culars : And fo tapping the.cafk, I found the liquor 
to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at the 
Brnfilsy nor indeed near fo good. At the opening 
of the cheft, fcvcral things appeared very ufeful to 
me : For infbnce, I found in oti^ a very fine cafe of 
bottles, containii^ the fineft and beft forts of cordial 
waters : Each bottie held about three pints, curioufly 
tipt with filver. I found alfo two pots full of the 
choiceft fweet- meats, and two more which the water 
Jiad utterly fpoiled. There were likewife feveral good 
ftiirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and about a dozen 
smd a half ^f linnen white handkerchiefs and coloured 
neckcloths, the former of which were abfolutely ne- 
cedary for. wiping my face in a hot ,day ; and in the 
till, I found three bags of pieces of^ eight, about 
eleven hundred in all y in aJl of which, decently 
wrapt up in a piece of paper, were (ix doubloons of 
gold, and fome fmall bars and wedges of the fame 
metill, which I believe mi^ht weigh near a pound. 
In the other cheft, which 1 gueffed to belong to the 
gunner's mate, by the mean circumftances that at- 
tended it, I only found fome cloaths of very little 
value, .except about two pounds of fine glazed pow- 
der, in three flafks, kept, as I believe, for charging- 
their fowling-pieces on any occafion. So* that on 
the whole, I had no great advantage by this voyage: 
The. nipney ^*as indeed as mere dirt to me, ufekfs 
and unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted 
with for two or three Engliflj pair of Ihoes and flrock- 
ings ; things that for many years 1 had nut worn i 
except lately thofe which I had taken off the feet ot 
thofe unfortunate men I found drowned^in the wreck, 
yet not fo good as Englijh fhoes, either for eaic or 
fervice : And having found in the feamen's cheit 
;.bout fifty pieces of eight in rials, but no gold, I 

fuppofe

Aippofc what I took from the firft belonged to :rn 
officer, to whom this fecmed to have a much inferior 
perfon for its owner. Well, the money as Jefplca- 
ble as it fccmed, I likewifehigged tomy eavc, laying 
it up fecurely as I did the relt^'of my car;: o. After I 
had done all this, I returned b;;ck to my bo.it, rowing 
or paddling her along till 1 came to my old harlwur, 
where I carefully laid her up, and io made the hdl 
of my way to my caflle. When I arrived ther?, every 
thing feemed fafc and quiet ; fo that now my only 
bufinefs, was to repofe my felf after my vantcd man- 
ner, and take care of my domeftic 1 iTurs. But 
tho' I might have lived very eafy, as waning for no- 
thing abiolutely needful, yet Hill I was more vigi'ant 
than ufual on account ot the favages, nt.' .er g^'ing 
much abroad 5 or if I did it was to the £r*/f part of 
the ifland, where I was well allured that the favages 
never came, and where I mii^ht not be trtaibicd to 
carry that heavy load of weapons form/ defence, 
as I was obliged to do if I went the other 'vny. 
• Two years did I live in this anxious coi.ilition, in 
all Mrhicn rime, coHtrarj' to my former 1 "oUitions, 
my head was filled with nothing but proj"< V? ?.nd ilc- 
fignshow I might efcape from this iiland : And (b 
much were my wanderinjj thoughts bent on a ram- 
bling difpofition, that had 1 the mmc boat that f went 
from Salie in^ I fhould have ventured once more to 
the uncertainty of the raging ocean. 
. But certainly 1 was an unhappy inftancfi of that 
part of mankind, who made thcmfelvcs v.rctched by 
their diffatisfaftion with tiie ft.uion whu-h (Jod lias 
placed them in r For, not to take a rev iew of my pri- 
mitive condition, and my father's excellent ail vie?; 
the contrary to which was, as I may fay, my original 
fifty my following milbkes, of the A^me numre, 
had been the means of my prefent unhappy llition: 
What bufmefs had I to kave a fettled fortune, and 
well ftocked plantation^ improving and incrcafing* 

where 



where by this time I might Jiave been worth ^ hun- 
dred thoufand moidores, to turn fupra cargo to 
Guinea^ to fetch NegroiSy When time and patience 
would have fo much enlarged ou» ftock at home, as 
to be able to employ thofe, whofe m6re immediate 
bufinefs it was to fetch them home, even to our 
doors ? 

But as this is very common the fate of. young 
heads, fo as a ferious reflexion upon the folly of it, 
ordinarily attends the exercife of future years, when 
the dear-bought experience of time is fo much re- 
pented of. Thus it was with me at that feafon j but 
notwithftanding what I had, or might fufFer upon 
thefe occafions, the thoughts of my deliverance 
ran fo ftrongly in my mind, as feemed to check all the 
diAates of my poor rcafon and philofophy. And. 
now to uiher my kind reader, with greater pleafure 
to the remaining part of my relations, 1 flatter my-* 
felf it will not be taken amils to give him an account 
of my firft conceptions on the manner of efcapin^, 
and upon what foundation I laid out my foolim 
' fchemes. 

I muft now fuppofe myfelf retired to my caftle af- 
ter my late voyage to the fhip, my frigate laid up 
and fecured, as ufual, and my condition in the 
fame manner as before, except being richer 5 tho' I 
had as little occafion for riches as the Indians of Peru 
had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among 
them. One night in Marcb^ being the rainy feafon, 
in the four and twentieth year of this my folitude, I 
was laying on my bed awake, very well in health, with- 
out diftemper, pain or uncommon uneafinefs, either 
of body or mind ; yet for all this, I could not com- 
pofe myfelf to fleep the night long. All this tedious 
^^hlle, it is impofTible to exprefs what innumerable 
thought!iB came into my head : I traced quite over the 
whole hiftory of my life in miniature, from my ut- 
moft remembrance of things, till i came to this ifland- 

and 



t »05 ] 
and then proceeded to examine every'aAion and paf- 
fage that had occurred, flnce I had taken poflofTion of 
my kingdom, in my reflexions upon the latter, I 
was comparing my happy pofture of affairs m the 
beeining of my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear 
and concern, lince I difcovered the print ot a foot 
in tho fand ; that while I continued free without no- 
tions, I was incapable of forming any dreadful ap- 
prehenfions ; tho' I ouc;ht rather to be thankful for 
the knowledge of my danger, flnce then it was the 
greateft happinefs to have fufEcient time to provide ior 
my reflexion : How ftupendous is the goodnefs of 
providence, which fets luch narrow bouncTs to the 
fight and knowledge of human nature, that while 
nncn walk in the midft of fo many dangers, they arc 
kept ferene and calm, by having the event of things 
hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing at all of 
thofe many dangers that furround them, till perhaps 
they are difflpatcd and vanifhed quite away. 

And when I came more particularly to confider of 
the real danger I had for fo many years efcaped ; how 
I had walked about in the greateit fecurity and tran- 

J utility at a time, perhaps when even nothing but 
ic brow of a hill, a great tree, or the common ap- 
proach of night, had only interpofed betv. ccn mc and 
the dcftruflive hands of the cannibals, who v^oulj 
devour me with as good an appetite as I would a pi- 
geon or curlew. Surely all tJiis, I fay, could not but 
make me fincerely thankful -to my great prefervcr, 
whofe Angular protedlion I acknowledged with the 
greateft humility, and without whicli l muft inevi- 
tably have fallen into the cruel hands of thefe de- 
vourers. 

Thus having difcuffed thefe thoughts in. the clear- 
eft manner, according to my weak underftanding, I 
next proceeded to conlider the wretched nature of 
thefe dcftroying favages, by (^:c!ming, tho' with great 
reverence, to inquire vthy God fhould give up any 

of 



[ ro8 ] 

obieAion reafonaWy interpos'd : How can I efiift this 
(thoii2.I:c I) without I attack a whole caravan of 'em, 
and kill them all ? Why fhould I proceed on fuch a 
dcibe'-ate attempt, which before my fcruples had fug- 
gtikd to me were unlawful, and made my heart 
tremble at the thoughts of fo much blood, tho' it 
were a means to procure my deliverance ! And tho' 
I might, according to my reafon, fuppofe that thefe 
men were the real enemies to my life, and would de- 
vour me, was it in their power, fo that it was felf- 
prefervation in the highcft degree, to free myfelf from 
this dread of life, by a<^ing in my own defence, as 
if they were actually aflaulting me : Tho' all thefe 
things, I fay, fecm'd to me to be of the greateft 
weight; yet, as I j»ift faid before, tte dreadfid 
thoujjhts of ihedding human blood, ftnick fuch a 
terror to my (bul, that it was a long time, before I 
ccuKl reconcile niyfclf. 

But how far will the ardency of defire prompt us 
on ? For notwithilanding the many difputes and per- 
plexities I had with myu-lf about it, right or wrong* 
I was refolved to get one of thefe favages into my 
bands, let it coft what it would, or lofe my life in 
the attcp^pt. Thus infpired with a firm refolution, 
fill my wits were rt work, in the next place, to find 
out V'hat methods • fl^culd take to anfwer my defign; 
and this indeed w^s very difficult to refolve on. Since 
then I could j lot pitch upon any probable means for 
it, I refolved runti.'jaily to be in a vigilant pofture, to 
perceive v/hen trie f;i valves came on ihore,and fo leave 
the reft ^1' the event, let the opportunities offer as 
they wouid. 

Such was my fixed rrfolution, and accordingly! 
fet myftlf upon th;; fcout, as often as I could, till 
fuch time as I was )»cartly tired of it. I waited for 
above a year and a half, the greateft part of which 
time I went out to the weft end, and fouth weft cor- 
ner of the liland,. .^moft every day, to fee for canoes^

Am bcmg able at any time to do me a mifchicf. 
Many a time did I ufc to pleafe myfelf with this affair, 
with long and ardent expedations ; but nothing yet 
prefented, all my deep projeAed fchemes and numer- 
ous fancies vaniflied away, as tho' while I retained 
thofe thoughts, the decree of providence was fuch» 
that no favages were to come near me. 

It was about a year and a half, that as I was moil: 
ferioufly mufing ot fundry ways how I fliould attain 
my end, one morning early I was very much furprifed 
by feeing no leis than five canoes all on fhore toge- 
ther on my fide the ifland, and the creatures that be- 
longed to them all landed, and out of my fight. Such 
a number of them difconcerted all my mcafurcs ; for 
ieeing fo many boats, each of which would contain 
fix, and fometimes more, I could not tell what tQ 
think of it, or how to order mv meafures, to attack 
twenty or thirty men fingle nanded : Upon which 
much difcomforted and perplexed, I lay ftill in my 
caftle; however I put myfelf in the fame pofture for 
an attack, that I had formerly provided againft, and 
was ready to enter upon an engagement, mould they 
attempt it. But when I had waited a long while, till 
iuch time as my impatient temper wojild let me bear it 
no longer, I fet my guns at the foot of my ladder,, and 
as ufual afcended up to the top of the hill at two fbges^ 
however, (landing that my head did not appear above 
t^ hill fo that by afty means they could not perceive 
K me I 



r no ] 
mc ; and here I ob&n^ed by the affiftanee of my per^ 
fpc&iye glaTs, no lefs than thirty in number around a 
fire, feaftin^ upon what meat they bad dreiled : How 
they cooked it, or what it was, I could not then per- 
feAly tell ; but they were all dancing and capering 
about the flames, uung many frightful, and barba-^ 
rous geftures. 

But while with a curious eye I was beholding thcfe 
wretches, my fpirits fimk within me, when I per- 
ceived them drag two mifcrablc creatures from the 
boats to aft a frein the dreadful tragedy, as I fuppofcd 
they had done before. It was not long. before one of 
them fell upon the ground, knocked down as I fup- 
pofed, with a club, or wooden fword ; for that was 
their manner, while two or three others went imme- 
diately to work, cutting him open for their cookeryi 
and tnen fell to devour him as they had done the for- 
mer, while the laft unhappy captive was left by him- 
felf till fuch time as they were ready for him. The 
poor creature looked round him with a wiihful eye, 
trembling at the thoughts of death, yet feeing himlelf 
p. little at liberty, nature that very moment, as it 
were infpired him with hopes of life, that he ftarted 
away from them, and ran with incredible fwiftnefs 
along the fands direftly to that part of the coafl where 
my ancient and venerable caftle ftood. 

You may imagine I was dreadfully affrighted upon 
this occafion, when as I thought, the) purfued him 
in a whole body, all runing towards my palace. And 
now indeed I expeded that part of my dream was go- 
ing to be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to 
my grove for proteclion; but for the reft of my dream 
I could depend nothing on it, that the favages would 
purfue him thither and find him there. However my 
fpirits beginning to recover, I ftill kept upon my 

§u::rd, when 1 plainly perceived there were but 
iree men out of the number, that purfued him ; 
and I was infinitely pleafed with' what fwift- 
nefs 



[Ill 3 

fiefs the poor creature ran from liis purfuers, gaining 
much ground of them, that I plainly perceived, 
could he thus hold it for half an hour, there whs not 
the Icaft doubt but he would fave his life from the 
power of his enemies. 

Between them and my caflle there was a creek, that 
very fame where I failed' into with nil my tffcfts from 
the wreck of the ftiip, on the ftccp banks of which L 
very much feared the poor viftim would be takt ii, if 
be could not fwim for his efcape : But foon was I out 
out of pain for him when he made nothing of it tlio* 
at full tide ; but with an intrepid courage, fpurrcd 
on by the fcnfe of danger, he plunged into the AckkI,. 
fwiraing over in about thirty flrokcs, and then land- 
ing, ran with the fame wonderful ftrc n^th and fwift- 
nefs as before. When the three purl'utrs came to 
the creek, one of them, whom I perceived could 
not fwim, happily, for his part, returned back to his 
company ; while the others with as equal a)iirage, 
bttt much lefs fwiftncfs, attained the other fide, as 
tho' the were never refolved to give over their purl'uit. 
And now, or never, I thouf^ht was the time for me 
to procure a fervant, companion or afliftant ; and that 
I was decreed by providence to be the inftrument that 
fhould fave this poor creature's life. I immediately 
dcfccndcd my two ladders with the grcatc rt expedition,. 
I took up my two guns, which 1 faid before were at 
the bottom of them ; and getting up again, with the 
fame hafte towards the hill, I made nearer the fca : In a 
word taking a (hort cut down the hill, I intcrpofcd 
between the purfuers and the purfucd, hallowing aloud 
to the latter, who venturing to look back, was no 
doubt at firft as much terrified at me as at them. I 
beckoned to him with my hand to return back, in the 
mean time flowly advancing towards the purfuers ; 
when fuddenly nifhing on the forcmoft, I knocked 
him down with tlie ftock of my piece, and laid him 
K 2 flat 



f "» ] 

Hat on the ground. I was very unwilling to fire left 
the reft Ihculd hear, tho' at that diilance I qucftioa 
whether they coutd or not ;. and being out of fight of 
the fmoak, they could not eafily have known what ta 
Aake of it. The other lavage feeing bis fellow fall, 
ftopt as if he had been amazed, when advancing to- 
wards him, I could perceive him take his bow from 
his back^ and fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to 
flioot at me, and without difpute might have locked 
the arrow in my breaft, had I given him leave ; but 
in thisabfoluteiy neceflary caufe of felf-prefervatioD| 
I immediately hred at him, and Ihot him dead, juft 
as his hand was going to draw the fatal firing. All 
this while the favage, who had fled before, ftoodftilV 
bad the fatisfadion to fee bis enemies fall, or killed 
as he thought, whodefigned to take away his life: 
£o affrighted was he with the fire and' noife of m^ 
piece, that be ftood, as it were, like Lois wife, fixt 
and imihoval, without fenfe, and without mo* 
tion. This made me hollow to him again, makinz 
the plainefl figns I could to him to draw nearer : I 
perceived he underftood thefe tokens, by his ap* 

Sroaching to me a little way, when, as if afrdd I 
lould kill him too, he flopt again. Several times 
did he advance, and as often ftopt in this manner, till 
coming more to my view,. I perceived him trembling,^ 
as if he was to undergo the lame fate Upon which 
I looked upon him with a fmiling countenance, and 
ftill beckoning to him at length he come clofe to me, 
kneeled down, kiiTed the ground, laid his head upon 
It, and taking me by my foot, fet the fame upon his 
head : And this, as I underftood afterwards, was a 
token of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took 
him up, and making very much of him, encouraged 
him in the beft manner I could. But here my work 
was not yet finilhed ; for I pevceived the favage whom 
I knocked down, was not killed, but ftunned with 
the blow, and began to come to himfcll^ Upon which 



t «r.? 1 

I pointed to my new fcrvant and ftiewlnjc him that 
his enemy was not yet expired, he fpokc fome words 
to me, but what I could not undcrftand ; yet being the 
firft found of a man's voice I had heard for above thcfc 
twenty five years, they were vir/ pleafmg to me. 
But there was no time for rcfleAion now, the wound- 
ed favage recovering himfclf fo far as to fit upon the 
ground, which made my poor prifoner as much afraid, 
as before : To put him out of which fear I prefented 
my other gun at the man, with an intent to (hoot 
him ; but my favage, for fo I muft now call him^ 
prevented my firing, by making a motion to me. to lend 
nim my fword, whicn hung naked in a belt by my 
fide. • No focner did I grant his requeft, but away 
he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his 
bead, as dexteronfly as the moft acc£>mplini'd execu-- 
tioner in Germany could have done : For it fccms thefc 
creatures make ufc of wooden fwords, made of hard^ 
wood, which will bear an edge, enough ta cut off 
heads and arms at one blow. When this valorous 
exploit was done, he came to rae laughing, as a token 
of triumph, delivered: me my fword again with 
abundance of furprizing gcftures, laying it along, 
with the bleeding and ghaftly head, of the If)Jian at my 
feet. 

The greatcft aftoni&ment that my new fcrva/it 
conceived was the manner of killing the favage at fuch 
» diftancc without a bow and arrow : and fuch was 
his longing delire to know it,, that he fixft pointed to 
the dead creature, and then made figns to rae to grant 
him leave to go to him. Upon which I bid him go„ 
ind as well as I could made him ftnfible I granted nis 
requeft. But whjc-n he came there, how wondi.ifully 
was heftrickcn with amazement! fiift lie turned hini 
on one fide, then on another, wondering he could 
perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding inwardly : 
And after fufficiently admiring the. wound the bullet 
hsd nude in his breaft^ he took up his bow and ur~ 

rows. 



[ "♦ 1 

rows, and came back again ; upon which I turned to 
go awa\', making many figns to him to follow, leaft 
the rcfty miffing their companions^ might come in 
purfuit of him« And this 1 found he underftood very 
well, bv his making me underftand that his deCgn 
was to Dury them^ that it might not be feen if it hap- 

rmed ; and which by iigns again, I made him fenfible 
very much approved of. Immediately he fell to 
work, and never was grave-digger more dexterous 
in the world than he was ; for in an inftant, as I 
might fay, he fcraped a targe hole in the (and with his 
hands, fufficient to bury the firft in,- there he dragged 
him, and without any ceremony covered him over. 
In like manner he ferved the other; So that I am 
fure no undertaker could be more expert in his bufi- 
nefs, for all this was done in lefs than a quarter fd 
an hour. I then called him away, and inftead of car- 
rying hira direftly to my caftle at firft, I conveyed 
him to my c^ve on the further part of the Ifland : 
And fo my dream was not fulfilled in that particular, 
that my grove fhould prove an a^Tylum or fanAuaiy 
to him. 

Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubted- 
ly muft this poor* creature be, fupportcd chiefly by. 
that vivacity of fpirit, and uncommon tranfports erf 

1'oy, that his deliverance occafioned. Here I gave 
\\m bread, and ^ bunch of raifins to eat,, and water 
to drink, of which feeding very chearfuHy, to hi$ 
exceeding refrcfhment, I made him a convenient bed 
with a parcel of rice flraw, and a . blanket upon it, (a 
bed which I ufed myfclf fomctimes) and then point* 
ing to him made figns for him to lie down to lit ep^ 
upon which the poor creature went to take a welcome 
tepofe. 

Indeed he was a very comely handfome young fel- 
low, extrcmly well made, with ftrait long limbs^ 
not too large ^ tall, and well iTiaped ; and, as 1 could 
reckon, about twenty-fxx years of age. His coun- 
.. tenance 



f "5 1 

leimnce had nothing in it fierce and furlf, but rather 
a fort of majefty in his face ; and yet, ci'pccially when 
he fmiled, he nad all the fwcetnefs and roftncTs of an 
European. His hair was not curled like wool, as 
many of the BlacJts are, but lon^ and black, with the 
moft beautiful, yet carelefs trcfles fprcading over his 
Ihoulders He had a very high and large forehead, 
with a ereat vivacity and fparkling fliarpncfs in his 
eves. His (kin was not fo tawny as the FirginianSy 
irafiUamy or other Aaurtlans, but rather of a bright 
dun olive colour, that had fbmething agreeable in it, 
tho' not very eafy to give a dcicnption of. His face 
was round and plump, with a fmall nofc, very dif- 
ferent from the flatnefs of the negroes, a pretty finall 
mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well fet, and 
white as the driven fnow. In a word, fuch hajid- 
ioAe feajures, and exadtly fymetry in every part, made 
me confidcr, that 1 had (aved the life- of an Indian 
prince, no Icfs graceful and accompliihcd, than the 
great Oroonch^ whofcr memorable bchavioui', and un« 
happy contigcncies of life, has charmed the world 
both to admiration of his perfon, and compafEoii to 
his fuffermgs. 

But let him beelther prince orpeafant, all my hap« 
pinefs centered in this, that I had now ^ot a good fer* 
vant, or companion, to whom, as he deferved, 1 was 
refolved to prove a kind mail r, an • lafting friend. 
He had not, I thin , fl pt above an hour, but he 
awakened a^ain, and while 1 was milking my goats 
hard by, out he run, from the cave towards mc in my 
enclofute, and laying himfelf down on the ground in 
the loweft proftration, made all the antick. geftures 
imaginable, to exprcfs h s thaiikfulncfs to me for be« 
ing his deliverr r. 1 ccnfcis, tho' the manner of his 
behaviour Teemed to be ludicrous enough to occafion 
laughter ; yet 1 was very much niovul at his affv£tioR 
fo that my heart melted within me, feann^ he 
might die away in exccfi of joy, like reprieved male-^ 

fadors^ 



t "6 ] 

faflors ; and then I was incapable either to let him 
blood, or adminifter phyfic. And I wifli many 
chriftians would take example by this heathen, to 
have a lafting remembrance of thofe great benefits 
and dcliverences they have received, by the kind me- 
ditation and powerful interpofition of their benefaftors 
and deliverers : And I fhould be glad alfo, if I had 
no occafion to blame many, who inftead of thank- 
fully acknowledging thefe kmd of favours and benefits, 
rather abufe and contemn thofe good perfons who 
have been the principal inftruoients to fave them from 
deftrudlion. 

But leaving thefe very juft refleftions, I muft re- 
turn to the objeft that occafioned them : For my man, 
to conclude the laft ceremony of obedience, laid dowii 
his head again on the ground, dofe to my foot, and 
fet my other foot upon his head, as he had done be- 
fore, making all the figns of fubjeftion, fervitudc and 
fubmiflion immaginable, to let me underftand he 
would ferve me as long as his life endured. As I un- 
derftood him in m.any things, I made him fenfible I was 
very well pleafed with him; and in a little time I bcpui 
to (peak to him, and learn him how to t;^k to me again. 
In the firft place I made him to underftand his name 
to be Friday^ becaufe it was upon that day I favedhis 
lifd* Then I taught him to fay Majier^ which I made 
him fenfible was to be my name, I likewife learned 
him to fay yes and m^ and to know what they meant. 
I gave him fome milk in an earthen pot, mating him 
view me while I drank it before him, and fopt my 
bread in it ; and I gave him a cake of bread, caus- 
ing him to do the like, to which he readily confent- 
ed, making figns of the greatcft fatisfaclion immagi- 
nable. 

^ All that, night did I keep him there, but no fooner 

did th? morning light appear, when I ordered him to 

an re and come along with me, with certain tokens 

that I would give him fome cloaths like mine ; at 

— which 



[ i»7 1 
which he feemed very glad^ as bang ftark naked, not 
fo much as any thin^ to cover what ought to be con* 
cealed. As we paifed by the place where the two 
men had been interred, my man pointed dirciflly to 
their graves, fhcwing me the marks that he had made 
to find them again; giving me to underfbnd by figns^ 
that he fhould die them up and devour them : IJpoa 
which I appeared extremely difpleafed, expreflcd my 
utmofl: abhorrence, made as if I would vomit at the 
apprehenfions of it, beckonine him with my hand to 
come away, which he did with the grcateft reverence 
aud fubmiflion. After this I condu<&d him to the top 
of the hill, to view if the reft of the favages were 
yet remaining there ; but when I looked through my 
perfpe6live glafs, I could fee no appearance of them, 
nor of their canoes, fo that it was very evident they 
never minded their dcceafed companions whom wc had 
flain, which if they had, they would furely have fearch- 
ed for, or left one boat behmd for them to follow, af- 
ter they returued to their purfuit. 

But ftill my cudofity and defire of fatisfadlion ani-^ 
mating my fpirit with freih courage, I took my man 
Friday with me, putting a fword mto his hand, with 
the bow and arrows at his back, which I perceived 
he could ufe very dcxteroufly^ caufing him to carry 
one gun for me, and I two for myfelf ; and thua 
equipped agaiaft all attacks, away we marched direct- 
^Jy to the place of their bloody entertainment. But 
when I came there, I was ftrickcn with the ufual hor- 
ror at fo dreadful a fpe<^acle ; whilft Friday indeed 
was no way concerned about it \, being, no doubt, in 
his turn like one of thefe devourers. Here lay feveral 
human bones, there feveral pieces of mangled flefh,. 
half eaten, mangled and fcorched j whilft Sreams ot 
blood ran promifcuoafly as waters from a fountain.. 
As I was muiing in this dreadful fight, Friday took all 
the pains he could, by particular figns, to make mc un- 
derftapd^ Chat they had brought over four prifoners t^ 

feaft 



C "8 1 

ftaft upon, three of which they had eaten, an^ 
that as he was the four^th, pointing to himfelf : Tha^ 
there having been a bloody battle between them and 
his great king, in the juft defence of whom he was 
taken prifoner, with many others ; all which were 
carried to feveral places to be devoured by their con- 
querors, and that it was his misfortune to be brought 
hither by thefe wretches, for the fame purpofe. 

After I was made fenfibleof thefe things, I caufcd 
Friday to gather thofc horrid remains, and lay them 
together upon a heap, which I ordered to be fct on 
fire, and fo burnt them to afhes : And ftill I found 
my man retained the nature of a cannibal, having a 
hankering ftomack after fomeofthc flefh : But fuch 
an extream abhorrance did I exprefs at the laft appear- 
ance of it, that he durft no otherwifc than conceal ; 
fori made him very fcnfible that if he offered any fuch 
thing I would certainly fhoot him. 

All this being done, I carried my man with me to 
nry caftle 5 and then I gave him a pair of linen 
drawers, which 1 had taken out of the poor s:unner's 
theft before-mentioned ; and which, with a little al- 
teration, fitted him very well : In the next place I 
made him a jerkin of goats-fkin, fuch as my (kill 
was able to manage, tho* I thought my felf then a to- 
lerable good tiiylor. I gave him alfo a cap, which 
I made of a hare-fkin, very convenient and fafliion- 
able. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man 
was no Icfs proud of his habit, than I was in feeing; 
him in it. Indeed he went very aukwardly in thefe 
things at firft, the drawers being too heavy on his 
thighs, not ufcd to bear any weight, and the fleeves 
of the waiftcoat galled his fhculders, and the infidc 
of his arms ; but a little eafing them, where he com- 
plained they hurt him, and ufmg himfelf to them, at 
length he took to them very well. 

My next concern was v/hcre I fliould lodge him ; 
and that I might do y^xy well by him, and yet be per- 

fcftly 



I "9 I 

fcftly eary myfelf, I creacd a tent for him in tlic ti^ 
cant place between my two forcificutions. In the in- 
iide of the laft, and outfiJe of chc fii ll : • Anil as 
there was an entrance or door in my cisvc, 1 n.ade 
a formal framed door-caic, and a door to o{x*n on 
the-infide. I barred it up in the ni^^ht time, taking 
in mv ladders too ; fo that was my man to prove 
treacherous, there would be no way to come at me in 
the infide of my innermoft Avail, witliouc making fo 
much noife in getting over, that it muft needs waken 
* me ; for my nrft wall had now a complete roof over 
it of long poles, fprcading over my tent, and leaning 
up to the fide of the mountain, which was again laid 
crofs with fmallerfticks inftead of laths, and tiiatch- 
ed over a great thicknefs with the rice ftraw, which 
was as (Irong as reeds ; and at the hole of the place, 
left on purpofc to go in or out by the ladder, 1 had 
placed-a kind of trap-door, which if it had been at- 
tempted on theoutfide, would not have opened at all, 
but have fallen down and made a great noifc ; and as 
to my weapons, every night I took them all to my 
l)ed's fide. 

But there was no occafion for this precaution ; for 
furely never mafter had more fincere, faithful and lov- 
ing fervant than Friday proved to me, without paffions, 
fuJlennefs ordefigns, pcrfcftly obliging and engaging: 
His afFedlions were as much tied to mc, as thofc of a 
child to his parents ; and I might venture to fay, he 
would have facrificed his life for the faving of mine, 
upon any occafion whatfoever. And indeed the many 
teftimonies he gave me of this, very fufEciently con- 
vinced me, that I had no occafion to ufe th^^fc pre- 
cautions. And here I could not but reflcdl, with great 
wonder, that however it has pleafed the almighty in 
Ms providence, and in the government of th* crea- 
tion, to take from fo great a part of the world of his 
creatures, the nobleft ufss to which their faculties, 
and the powers of their fouls arc adapted j yet that

better ufe of it, than mankind generally does s

T liad n6t 1)een above two or three or dm returned !• 
iny cafllc, but my chief deH^ was, now I (hould 
bring Friday cff from his homd way of feeding ; amd 
to take from him that inhuman rclifli he, \ty nature^ 
tad becnaccuftomed to, I thought itmy duty to let him 
tafte other flcfli, which -might the rather tempt him t« 
the fame abhorrence I fo often exprcffed againft their 
accurfed way of living. Upon which, one morii <j, 
I took him out with me, with an intention to kill a kid 
•out of the flock, and bring it home and drcfi it : But 
«s I was going, I perceived afhc-goat lying down in the 
ihade and two young kids fitting by her* Imnicdiste- 
\y I catched hold of mv man Friddiy^ and bidding him 
Itand ftiil, and not Uir, I prcfciitcd my piece, and 
ihot one of the kids. Mv poor fcrrant, who had at 
a diftaiK?c perceived me kill his adverfary, and yet did 
not know by what meiuis, or hcrw it was done, flood 
trembling and furprifcd, ajid looked fo amazed, that 
I thought he would have funk into the earth. He 
idid not fee the kid I aimed at, orbchdd I had killed it, 
tut ript tip his waiftcoat M fee if lie was not wounded, 
thinking my refolution was to kill him; fo coming 
■to me, he fdl on his knees, canicftly pronouncing 
many things which I did not not underfbnd, the mcaji- 
ing of which at length 1 j)erccivcd was, that 1 would 
5iot take away. his life. 

Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that 
condition where nature is u}:on the fevcrcfl trial, v/hcu 
the immediate hand cf death is ready to put for ever a 
■ period to this mortd life : And indeed fo much com- 
paflion had I for this creature, that it was vith diffi- 
-culty I refrained from tears. But however as another 
fort of countenance was'hcceflary, to convince him 
that I would do him no harm, T took him fmiling 
•^by the hand, theii laughed at him, and pointing to

tudbeen before in beholding the Indian ^ while be

{cnxly perceived a pc2X fowl like a hawk, perching 
upon a tree wirhin (net ; and therefore to let Friiuj 
undcHrand what I was going to do, I called hi it. :o 
me again, pointing at the fowl, which I found to be 
a parrot. I made him underftand that I would ihooc 
and kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bad him

Again he ffood like one amazed, notwithftanding all

man or beaft, mull certainly create the grcatcft 
aftoniihment to oriC who never had heard of fuch a 
thing in his whole life: And really his amazement 
continued fo long, that had I allowed it, he would 
have proftratcd himfelf before me and my gun, with 
the grcatcft worihip and adoration. As for the gun ia 
particular, he would not fo much as fofFer his nngers 
to touch it for fevcral days after ; but would come and 
communicr.'LC his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as \i 
the fenceleis piece had undcrftoodandanfwered him: 
All this I could perceive him do, when he thought my 
back v»^as turned ; the chief intent of which was, to 
defjrc it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to un- 
derftand. 

1 r.cver ftrove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder 
him from thofe comical gcftures he ui'ed on fuch oc- 
cafior.s : But when his altonifhmcnt was a little over, 
I madi tokens to him to run and fetch the parrot that 
I had ibot, whicli he accordingly did, ftaying fomc 
time longer than ufual, by rcafon the bird not being 
quite dead, had fluttered fome way farther from the 
place where he fell. In the mean time as he was 
bxiking for her, I took the advantage of charging my 
gun again, that I might be ready for another marie

^at might offer itfelf ; but nothing more oecurcd at 
that time. So I brought home the kid, and the fam« 
evening took ofF the /kin, and divided the circafe as 
well as I could. Part of this flefli I (Icwcd, or boiled,, 
in a pot I had for this occafion. And then fpreading 
my table, I fat down, eivin^ my man fome to eat too^ 
wno was wonderfully pTcafed, anc^ feemed to VAx k 
very well ; but what was moft rurprifino; to him, was 
to fee me eat fait with it : Upon which he made rot 
to underftand, that the fait was very bad for me; when 
putting a little into his mouth, he f::emed to nauCeatc 
It in fuch a manner at to fpit and fputter at it, and 
then wafhed his mouth with freih water; But tofliew 
bim* how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put 
fome meat in my mouth without fait, and feigned 
to fpit and* fputter as much for the want of it, as he 
bad done at it : Yet aU this proved of no fignificatioa 
to Friday : And it was a long while before he could 
endure fait in his mtat or bjp^b^ aad even then, but 
a very fmall quantity. 

• Tnus having fed nim fufficiently with boiled meat 
and broth that time, the next day I was rtfolved to 
feafthim with a toa&ci piece of tne kid. And having 
no fpit to faflen it, nor j^ck to turn k„ I made ufc ct 
that cenunoa artifice, which many of the people of 
England have ; that is, to fet tyro poles upon each 
fide of the fire, and one crofs on the top, hanging the 
meat thereon witli a firing,, and (o turnmg round cojw 
trnualiy, roaft it, as wt mA bloodv tyrants have cruel- 
ly roaf^ martyrs. 'I^hispradife caufed great admi« 
ration in my man Friday^ which is another-gueft 
way, to what .the barbarous favagcs were accuftomed» 
But when he came to tafle the Aveetncfs and tender- 
nefs of the flefh, he cxprefl his entice fatisfadtion in 
above a thoufand different ways. And as I could 
not but underftand his meaning, you may be fure £ 
was wonjdcrfully plcafed ; efpccialiy when he made 
Li it

It alfo v«y pHiin to mc, that he woulitievefy whilft 
lie li\Td eat man's flefh more. ^ 

We\]y now it waK high time I (hould fct my fcr- 
vant to work ; and fo the next day I l>ut him to beat 
out fome corn, and fift tt in the fame manner as I 
had done before. And really the fellow was very 
quick and handy in the execution of any thing^ I or- 
dered him to go about. I made him underftand that 
It v/as to make bread for us toeat, and after let him fc« 
me make and bake it : In ibort, he did every thin|af 
I ordered him, in a little tiooe, as well as I could go it 
myfelf. 

When I confideftd, that I had two mouths to feed 
inftead of one, I' was neceflarily obliged to. think that, 
in confcqucnxre thereof, I muft provide more ground 
for my harveft,. and plant a larger quantity of com 
than I commonly ufed ta do ^ upon wbicli' I marked 
Qut a bigget> piece of . knd^ fencing k in the lame 
manner as I had done before ; in the execution of whirb 
I muft give Friday this good worI, that no man couU 
work more hard or wiluagly than he did.: And whcB 
I made him fenfible that it waa for bread to ferve him 
as well as me ^ he then very paffionately made m« 
undcrftand, that he* thought J had much more labour 
on me on his account alone, than I had for myfelf^ 
ftnd that no pains or diligence fhould be wanting in 
him, if I would but i\tt&, him in thofe works whereia 
he might fucceed;. 

I muft certainly own^ that this was the mod plca- 
fent year I ever had in tiic Ifland : For, after fome time, 
Friday began to talk pretty wcll^ and undcrftand the 
names of tliofc things which 1 was wont to call for^ 
and the places where I ufed to fend him. So that my 
long fiknt tongue, which, had been ufelefs fo many 
years, except in an exclamatory manner, cither for 
deliverance or bleflings, now began to be occupied, 
in teachiii^r and talking to my man Friday.^ for in- 
deed I had iuch a fingulari futi:>fadion in the fellow 

himiclft.

any hankering inclination to return to his own country 
again: And by this time having learned him Ivtxifjh (o- 
well, that he could give me tolerable anfwtr!t to any 
queftions which I demanded, I afkcd him. Whether 
that nation,, to which he belonged, never conquered, 
in battle f This queiHon made Fndny fniile, and to 
which he anfwcred, Ylts^ yes^ Wi ahvays fight the bet^

Maftir. How, fay you, beat! if your nation beat

Friday. They more many mans than my nation in

and mfc:_'My nation much ov^r beat them.in the yond-

'Friday. They run, oik, two- or. three, and mej 
they make all gp in the canoo^ my nation liave no

Ifland to the fhore, and whether the canoes were noC 
oiten loft in the ocean ? to which he an C^cred, there 
was no danger, no canoes ever loft ^ ^^ that after a 
little way out to the fca, there was a. ftrong current, 
and a wind always one way in. the afternoon: This 
I thought at firft to be no more than the lets of the

I believe th^jfo is nq .'late of life but what may be 
happy, if peopk would but endeavour for their partto 
make it fo. He is not the happicft man that has the 
moft riches, but he that is content with what he hath* 
Before I had my fervant, I thought myfelf miferablc 
till I had him ; and now I enjoyed the happy bensfit» 
of him, I retained the (ame thoughts for want of a 
deliverance from a place of retirement,, eafe ani 
plenty, where providence had fufficiently bleffed mc: 
In a word, from this time I entertained fome hopes,, 
that one time or other I might find an opportnnitf 
to make my efcape from this Ifland^ and that thil> 
poor favage miglit be a great furtherance thereto* 

All the time fmce my man became (b intelligent 
as to underdand and fpeak to me, I fpared no paini 
or diligence to inftrucl him, according to my poor 
fiiare of knowledge, in the principles of religion^, 
and the adoration tl^t he ought ta pay to the true 
God. One tiine, as I very well remembej;, I afked- 
him who made him f at firft, the iniKMzent creatuit 
did not underlhmd what I meant, but rather thought 
1 a(kcd him, who was his father I Upon which I took 
another way to make him fenfible, by demanding of 
him an anfwer to this queftion> Friday^ (faid I) who- 
is it that made the Tea, this ground whereoii we walk, 
and all thcfe hills and. woods wiiich we behold ?. and. 
here indeed 1 did not mifs of my intention ; for he told- 
jne it was one old Benamuckee^ (the God whom I 
fuppofcd thefe favagcs adored*) who lived a great way 
beyond all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday was 
an utter llranger to them. He could defer ibe nothing 
of this great jxirfon ; and all that he could fay was,, 
that he was very old, much older than the fea and 
land, the mOon, or the ftars. Friday^ (faid I agaia) 
if this great ajid old perfou has made all things in the. 

worldfc 



t tiq J 
World, how comes it to pafs, that all thin!!:^, ^^ vna 
in particular, do not adore and worfliip him P upon 
this looking very grave, with a pert'cit fwect look of 
innocence, he reply ed, maflerj ail things ftiy O /# 
iim, by which it may rrafonably be fuppoled he meant 
adoration. And where, fuidl, do the people of voui 
country go when they die ? he anfwercd, they all go 
to B^namuckee. What, and thofe people that are 
taten up, do they go there ? Said he, Benanmckee Igv§ 
tbem dearly ; we pray ti Benamuckce /;/ clc Camo^ and 
Bcnamuckee would love me, when dey eat a me all up. 

Such difcourfes as tbefe had I with my man, and 
iiich made me fenfible, that the true God is worfhip- 
ed, tho* under imiysrie^l flmilitudcs. Atul that tha 
bUk adoration which tlic heathens give to their ima* 
ginary deity, is as great an argument of the divina 
eflence, as the moft learned athcift?, falfelyjo called, 
can bring againft it : For God will he glorihcd in hia 
works, let the denomination be what it will ; and \ 
cannot be of that opinion which fomc conceive, that 
God fbould decree men to -be damned for want of n 
right notion of faith, rn a [>lace where the power of 
the Ahnighty has not permitted it to be preached ; and 
therefore cannot but conclude, that fincc obc-dlcncc 
is the beft facrificc, thefe poor creatures, a^tin »: by 
that light and knowledge which. they ar: )X)li('l{(:a 
of, may undoubtedly obtain a happy fulvation, tho' 
Xiot that enjoyment with Chrijl as his faints, con* 
ftflbrs and martyrs. 

But leaving thcib diterminations afule, more fit for 
the ahleft divines than me to dilcufs, I began to in- 
ftru6t my fcrvaut in the (living knowledge of the 
true deity; in v/hich, the dirc6tions of Clod's koly 
fpirit afUited me. I lifted up mv hands to heaven, 
and pointing thereto, told him, tli-.u the great ni;ik( r 
of heaven and earth lived there : That as his inhniio 
power fafhioncd this world out of a confufcd cImios, 
aod made ic in that beautiful frame which wc behold.

1o hr -g:o\'cms and prcfervcs it, by his undoubted 
knowledge, fovereign greatnefs, and peculiar provi- 
dence: That he was omnipotent, could do every 
thing for us, give every thing to us, and take every 
ihing away from us : That he was a rewarder an« 
punifher of good and evil a<9ions : That there was 
nothing but what he knew, no thoughts fo fecrec 
but he could bring to light : And thus by degrees I 
opened his ejres, and defcribed to him the manner of 
the creation of the world, the fituation of paradice, 
the tranfgreffions of our firft parents, the wicked- 
ncfs of God's peculiar people, and the univerfal fins 
JRi^d abominations of the whole -earth. When theft 
things were implanted in his mind, I told him, that 
fts God's juitice was equal to his mercy, be refolved 
to dcftroy this world, 'till h» fon, ye/us Cbrift^ in* 
terpofed in our behalf, and to procure our redemp* 
tion, obtained leave of his heavenly Father to come 
down from heaven into the world, where he toA 
human nature upon him, inftni£ted us in ourwaf 
to eternal life, and died as a facriiice for us fins : 
That he was now afcended into heaven, mediatiiig 
for our pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining 
all thofe bendfits which we afked in his uame^ by 
bumble and hearty prayers, which were beard in tli 
throne of heaven. As very frequently I ufed to in- 
culcate things into his mind, Friday one day told 
me, that if our great God could hear tis beyond the 
fun, he muft then furely be a greater God than their 
Benamuckee^ who lived out a little way, arid yet could 
not hear them, till th^ afcended the great ni6uhtatns» 
where he dwelt, to Ipcak to him. What, faid I, 
Friday^ did you go thither to fpcak to him too ? he 
anfwered, no, they never went that were young 
men ; none but old men, called their Oowokakee^ 
meaning the Indian priefts, who went to Iky O, (fo 
he called faying their prayers) and they returned back, 
and Cold them what Benauiuckee faid. from hence i

could not but obfcrvc how happy we chriftiaiw irc^ 
who have God's immediate revelation for our ccrcain 
guide ; and that our faith is neither inifled, nor our 
Tc^fon impofcd. upon, . by any fct of men rcfcmbling 
thefc Indian impollors. 

But to clear up this palpable cheat to my man />/- 
.iay^ 1 told him, that the pretence of their ancient 
men going up to the mountains to iiy O to their 

fod Benamuckee^, was an iitlpoftor : And tliat their 
ringing back an ani'wer, was all a fham, if not 
worfe J for if there was any fuch thing fpolccn to 
them, fometimes it muft proceed from an infernal 
ipirit. And here I thought it neccfiUry to enter into 
^ long difcoiiirfe with him, which I did after this 
manner : 

Friday^ (faid I) you muft know, that before this 
world . was made, there was one almighty power, 
exiftent before the beginning, by whofe power all 
things were made, aixi whofe majefty lliall have no 
«nd. To be glorified and adored by oeings of a hea- 
venly nature, he created angels and archangels, that 
is, glorious ipirits refcmbling himfelf, to encompaft 
round his throne, eternally finging forth his praife in 
the moft heavenly founds and divine hannony. And 
among this heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a groat fway, 
as being then one of the particular favourites of thefe 
celeftial abodes : But he, contrary to that duty he 
owed his heavenly fovcrcign, with unbounded ingra- 
titude to his divine creator, not only envycd him 
that adoration which was his due, but thought to 
ufurp that throne which he had neither power to 
keep, nor title to pretend to. He niifed a diilcn- 
don and civil war in heaven, and had a number of 
^angel? to take his part. Unbounded folly; ftupcn- 
doiis pride ; thus to hope for vidtory, and afpire above 
fiis powerful Creator ! the deity, not fearful of fuch 
an enemy, yet juftly provoked at tliis rebellion, com- 
oniilions his archangel St. Michael to^ lead forth the

' which was quickly perceived, by Satan's being over- 
thrown, and the prince of the air, (for fo the Devil 
VfAS called) with all his fallen angds, driven headlong 
into a difmal place, which is called hell. 

The recital of this truth made my man give the 
^greateft attention, and he exprefled agreat (atisfadioiii 
hy his eefturcs, diat God had fent the Devil into tbi 
deep hole. And then I dedred bim ta give, great heed 
to what I had further to fay« 

No fooner (proceeded I) was God freed from, and 
Ae heavens clear of this arch^traitor, but the Father 
(peaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to 
his eflciKe, yet equal tQ him in power and glory, 
Xet us make jiian (faid he) in cur ewn image^ after WT 
twn likemfs^ Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over the 
creatures in the 'wx>rld which wc have created. And 
thcfe, he intended, (hould glorify him in heaven, ac- 
cording to their obedience in this ftate of probation on 
earth, which was as it were to be the fchool totraio 
them up for thofe heavenly manfions. Now SataU} 
feeing himfelf foikd, yet that God had not taken 
the power from him, as prince of the .air, which 
power heaven dcAgned he fhould retain, whereby bis 
creatures might be tried ; in revenge to the difgrace 
he had received, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve^ to taftc 
of the tree of kjiowJedgc of good and evil, which God 
•had forbidden. He appears to her in the ihape of a 
fcrpcnt, being then a mcft beautiful creature, and 
tells her, That it was no better than an impofition 
which God had put upon her and her hu(band, not 
to cat of that fair fruit which he had created 5 that 
the taflc thereof would make them, immortal, like 
Xjod himfcJf ; and confequcntly as great and power- 
ful as he. Upon which, flie not only eat thereof her- 
fclf, but made her hufband eat alfo, which brought 
them both under the heavenly difpleafure.

'ticTt Friday expreired a ereat concern : Jfj f p99r 
mam! (crycd he) naughty ffcmans ! n(rughu DeviU 
make God not 4qv€ di mansy make man like Dtvil him* 

Friday^ faid I, God ftill loved mankind ; and tho* 
the Devil tempted human nature fo fac, he would not 
fuffcr him to have abfolute power over them. I 
hive told you before of his tender love to his people, 
till thev, like Lucifer^ difobcyed his commands and 
lebellcd agamft him ; and that even then, how Jefus 
Cbrift his only fon came to fave finners. But ftill, 
every man that lives in the worlds is -under tempu^ 
tion and trial. The Devil has yet a power, as prince 
of the air, to fuggeft evil cogitations in our minds, 
land pron^pt us on to wicked a<^ions, that he might 
elory in our deftru<Slion. Whatever evil thoughts we 
have,. proceeded from him. So that God, in this our dif- 
trefs, expels that welhould apply ouri'dvcs to him by 
^rvent prayer for our fpccdy rcdrefs : He is not like 
£enamucket\ to let none come near him but Ootucka- 
he J but iufters the people, as well as pricfts, to offer 
themfelves at his ieet, thereby to be delivered from 
<the power and temptation of the *De\-iL 

But tho* at firft, my man Friday expreiTcd fomc con- 
cern at the wickodnefs of Lucifer y I found it not fo 
0afy to imprint the right notions of him in his mind, 
as it was about the divine efl*encc of God : For there 
nature ailifted me in all my arguments to (hew to him 
.plainly the ncceflity of a great firft caufe, and over- 
ruling governing power, a fccret directing providence, 
and of the equity and reafonablcfs of paying ado- 
ration to our creator : Whereas there appeared no- 
thing of all this in the notion of an evil fpirit, of 
his nrft beginning, his nature, and above all, of his 
snclinaticin tp evil anions, and hi^ power to tempt us 
on to the like. And indeed this unlearned Indian^ by 
the meer force of nature, puzzled me with one par- 
ticular queilion, contrary to whatever I had expe^ed 
from )\ixtu if I 



r ^34 ] 

I had, it fecms, on^ day, been talking to him ^f 
the omnipotent power of God, and his infinite ab- 
Jiorrcnce of fiii, iofomuch that the fcriptures ftiled 
him a confuming fire to all finful workers of iniquity; 
and that it was in his power, whenever he pleaicd, to 
dvjftroy r-U the world in a moment, the greater part 
or v/hich are continually offending him. 

When, with a fcrious attention, he had liftcneda 
great while to what I faid, after 1 had been telling 
him, how the Devil was God's enemy in the hearts of 
in£:n, and ufed all his malice and &iil to defeat the 
good dcfigns of providence, and to deftroy the king- 
dom of Chrijl in the world, and fo forth : Very wcD| 
maftcr ( faid /r/Vjfari) vou fay, God is fo ftrong, fc 
great, is he not much ftrongcr, much mightier than the 
haughty Devil ? to be fure, Fridi^^ faid I, God is more 
wife, and ftronger than the ferpent : He is above the 
Deril^ which makes xis pray to him, that he would 
tread down Salan under our feet, enable us to refift 
his violent temptations, and quench his fiery darts. 
IVIjy then, anfwered Friday quickly, i/Gody asycufaj^ 
has muchjirong^ much might as the Devil, why Goa n» 
kill Devil, make no more tefnpt, no more do wicked? 

You may be certain I was ftrangely furprifed at this 
quefiion of my man's ; and tho' an old man, I was 
but a young doclor, *md confequently very ill qualified 
for a cafuift, or a refohVx of intricate doubt& in reli- 
gion. And as it required fome time for me to ftudy for 
an ^nfwer, I pretended not to hear hi.m, nor to afk 
him whaL he faid : But too carneft was he for tn an-

when it became very evident to nic, how mcer natu-

knowledge of a deity, and to the homaj;;e due to 
the fupreme being of God ; but however nothing but 
divine revelation can from the knowledge; of Ji'fns 
Ghrijly and of a redemption purchafcd for \x?^^ of a 
mediator of the new covenant, and of an intcrccflor 
at the footftool of Gcd's throne; and tlicrcf.>rc the

I role up hailily, and made as if 1 had fome oce:ili';n

capacity, tbe rtafon why our Saviour took notonhita 
the nature of Angc]s, but rather the feed of Abraham^ 
kiid how upon that account the fallen Angels had no 
benefit by the redemption ; and laftly, that he came 
only to the loft {heep of the houfe of Ifrael^ and the 
like. God knows, I had siore iincerity than know- 
ledge in all the ways I took for this poor Indian's In- 
iirudtion ; and I muft acknowledge, that I believe 
every body that a<^s upon.the fame principle will ivasy 
that in laying heavenly truths open before him, iu 
many things, I informed and inftruAed myfelf, tbtf 
cither I did not know,, or had not perfcAly confidered 
€f before ? But as I fearched into them for the inforaia- 
tion of this poor favage, lb they naturally occurred to 
my mind ; and my enquiry after many things w» 
more afFe^ionate than ever I felt, in my life : fo that 
however this poor creature might be improv'd bv my 
inftrudiion, certain it is, that upon this account^! had 
great rcafon toblefs'kind providence for fendine him 
to me. His compaav allayed my grief^ and made my. 
habitatiotx more comfortable:. And when I refledcdthat 
this folitary life, to which I had been fo long confined^ 
had not only moved mc to look towards Hfeaven, but 
made me the ixiftrumcnt, under providence, to.fave the 
life, and, for aught I knew,, the fouUof a poor favage^, 
by bringing hita to the knowledge of Jefus Chrift; 
this caufed a (eciet joy to fpread thro' every part di 
my foul, and I firequently rejoiced that ever I was 
brought to this plaec, which I once thought to be the 
moU mifcrable part of tbe worJd. 

All the remainder of mj; time did I continue in this, 
thankful frame of mind, and for three years did my 
msin and I live in the greatcft enjoyment and happi- 
i^c^is, by our convcrfation one with another, as much. 
as 1 could cxpea or dcfirc. And indeed I believe the

I (hould have been by my own private rea:i in ! and

thf: experience I had in my rttircment ; it ua^, that 
infinite and incxpreffiblc bleflinj:, the kr.ov.lcdgj < f-

to be undcritood, as immcdi; rely to dirtct n.t tocr.y

orthodox divine ; and cfixjcially by this fame inllruc- 
tion, fo to enlighten this favage c.\aturc, as to make 
him fuch a good chriftian as vc: . few could exceed 
Jiim. And there was only this f-^reat thing wanting'-, 
that I had no authority to admin iiler the holy lb era- 
ment, that heavenly participation of Chrill's body 
and blood; yet however we relied ourfelves coi.uiit . 
»that God would accept our dtrn.;s, and, acccrdiiij; to ■ 
our faith, have mercy on us. 

- But what wc wanted one way was made up in a no- ■ 
thcr, and that was, univcrfal pean in our little chureii, . 
We had no difputes or wranglir.,!. about the nature ■ 
and equality of the holy, blciVed, ar.d undivided tri- 
nity ; no niceties in doflrinc, or Ich.eincs of church » 
government; no f'our-and morofc dillenters to ii^ipole 
more fublimatcd' notions upon us, ncr pedant foph in- 
ters to confound us with, unintelligible myiteries: but 
inftcad of all this, we enjoyed the molt certain guide 
to heaven i that js, the word of God, bcfidcs v/hith: 
M 3 we 



c 138 r 

we had the comfortible views of hit fiHfit, lealing 
us unto the truth, and makiog us both willing and 
obedient to the infbudioa of his word. And as the 
knowledge and pra£tice of which are the prinfipil 
means of ialTation, I cannot lee what it avaibanj 
chriftian church or man in the, world, to amine ; 
thcmfelves with every indifierent fpeculation and opi- 
nion, except thofe who have a mind to difpbj dxir 
particular vanity and afTeAation. 

You may well fuppofe that, by thele commoD dit 
courfcs we-had tojgether, my man and I became mot 
intimately acquainted, and that diere was but voy 
little that I could fa^, but Friday underftood, fpeakug 
verv fluently, tho' mdecd it was but broken EngSf, 
And really I now took a particular pleafure in idadag 
all my adventures, efpecially thofe that occured fism 
my being caft on this ifland. I made him undcfftaaJ 
that wonderful myftery^ as he (lonceived, of gunpov- 
der and bullet, and taught him how to ihoot : 1 aUb 
prefented him a knife, which pkafed him exceedinriv} 
making him a belt with a frog hanging thereto^ like 
thofe in which we wear hangers in England \ and in- 
ftead of a hanger to put in that frog, I gave him a 
hatchet, which was not only as good^ out a more cx^ 
cellent weapon upon any other occafion. In a word, 
my man, thus accoutered, looked upon himfdf u 
great as Don ^ixoti^ when that celebrated champion 
went to combat the wind-mill. 

After all this, I gave him a very particular defcrip- 
tion of the territories of £ur$pej and in a pguticuhr 
manner of Old England^ the place of my nativity* I 
laid before him the maimer of our worfhipping Goip 
our behaviour to one another, and how we traded in 
Ihips to every part of the univerfe. I then told him 
my misfortunes in being fbipwrecked, fliowing him, 
as near as I could, the place where the fliip lay, which 
had been long gone before. I brought him to the 
ruins of our Uxtts, which before my whole ftrength 

could 



r «39 1 

vould not move, but now was almoft rotten and faU 
len to pieces. I obftrved mj man Frldtty to view this 
boat with an uncommon curiofity, which when he 
had done, he ftood pondering a great while and fatd 
nothing. At laft faid I, Friday y what makes you pon- 
^ to much ? he replycd, O Majler^ me fee like boat 
ame U place at my nation, 

I was fome time indeed before I underftood what 
ny man meant ; but examining farther into it, I plain- 
ly fetmd, fuch another boat, refembling that, had come 
to the country where he dwelt ; at much as to fay^ 
ly his farther explanation, that the boat was driven 
dicre thro' violent ftorms and ftrcCs of Weather. It 
prefently came into my mind, that fome European (hip 
having been caft away, the poor diftrcft creatures 
were forced to have recourfe to the boat to favc their 
Jives ; and being all, as I thought, drowned, I never 
concerned myfelf to afk any thing about them, but 
my only enquiry was about the boat, and what de* 
fcription my man could give of it. 

Indeed Friday anfwered my demands very well, 
making every thing very plain to my underftanding i 
but efpecially I was fatisfied when he told me, with a 
great warmth and adour, O majhry we fave white 
mans from drown : Upon which I immediately a(ked. 
him, if there vrere any white mans^ as he called them, 
in the boat ? yes yesy faid he, the hat fuUy very full j 
white mans. How mShy, Friday? faid I. Hereupon 
he numbered his fineers and counted feventeen. And 
when I aiked him what became of them all, and whe- 
ther they lived or not ? he replyed, yes Majier^ they 
all livej they be live ^mong my Nation. This plainer in- 
formation put new thoughts into my head, that thefe 
muft be thofe very men, which before I concluded 
had been fwailowed up in the ocean after they had left 
their (hip, that had ftriick upon the rocks of my 
kingdom ; and after efcaping the furv of the deep, 
landed upon the wild (hore, and committed themfelves 
to the fury of thofe devouring Indians. The 



[ 140 ] 

The manner of their crutlries to one another, which 
conf.quwntly, as I thought, maftbe adlcd with grtater 
b^rlarity to Itrangers, created a great admiration with- 
in me, and m:uie me ftil! more curious to afk/W^ 
xronceming them : He told me, he was Aire they lived 
ftiii there, having rcfided among them above four 
years, ar;l the favaires gave them viAuals to live 
upon. Lut pray, Friday^ faid I, v/hence proceeded 
all this cooJ-natare and generofity ? How came it to 
pafs that they did not kill and eat them to pleafe their 
devouring appetites, and occafion fo fplcndid an En-* 
tcrtainmcnt among them ? No no^ faid Friday, thej 
nzt kill Vffi, they make brother xvlth *em ; by which I 
under Aood th:rc was a truce between them. And then 
I had a more favourable opinion of the Indians^ upon 
Fridays uttering thefc words j my nation^ father im- 
tion^ fiG cat mansy tut when mam make war fight \ 
as tho' hj had faid, that neither thofe of his king- 
dom, nor any other nation that he knew of, ever eat 
their fellow-creatures, but fuch whom their law of 
arms allowed to be devoured ; and they were thofe 
miferable captives, whofe great misfortune it ihould 
be to be made prisoners of war. 

Some confiderable time after, upon a very pleafant 
day, in moll fercne weather, my man and I ftood 
upon the top of a hill, on the eaft fide of the ifland, 
whence I had once before beheld the continent of 
America, I could not tell imiilfediately what was the 
matter, for fuddeuly Friday fell a jumping and dancing 
as if he had been mad ; and upon my demanding the 
reafon of his behaviour, O jcy f ikid he, O glad! 
*ThcrsJJee 7ny country ^ there my natictiy there live, wbitt 
mam ail get her. And indeed I'uch a rapturous fenfe cf 
pleafure appeared in his countenance, thi:t his eyes 
had an uncommon fparkling and brightnefs, and fuch 
a ftrange eagcrnefs, as if he had a longing dcfire to 
be ii) his own country again ; and this new obferva* 
tion which I had, made mc not fo well fatisficd with 

my 



r ur I 

my man Fridof al before ; for by this appearance T 
made no difpute, but tikit if he could get back thither 
a^in, he would not only be unmindful of whut reli- 
gion I had taught him, out likcwifc of the ereat obli- 
vion that he owed mc for his wonderful ddi vcrance : 
aay, that he would not onlv inform his countrymen 
of me^ but accompany huiioreds of them to my King- 
dom, and make me a mifcnablc facrifice like thofe un- 
happy wretches taken ip battle.. 
- indeed I was very much to blame to have thefe cruel 
and unjuft fufpicions, and muft freely own I wronged 
the poor creature very much,, who was quite of a con- 
trary temper ; and had he that difemung acutcnefs, 
which many Europeans have, he MroirftTTlKve perceived 
my coldneu and. iodifFeoence, and alfo have been very 
ttiiich concerned upon this account i For as I was now 
more circumfpedt, I had much lefTened my kindnef^ 
and familiarity with him : And while this jealoufy 
continued, I ufcd that artful way (now too much in 
iaihion to occafion ftrifc and diflenfion) of pumping 
Kim daily, thereby tQ difcover whether he was deceit- 
ful in his thoughts and inclinations : But certainly he 
had nothing in htm but what was confident with the 
heft principles, both as a religious chriftian and grate— 
fill friend ; and indeed I found evciy thing be faid was^ 
ft) ingenuous and innocent, that I had no room for fuf- 
' yicion, and, in fpicc of all uncaiincfs^hc not only made- 
me entirely his own again,, but alfo caufed me much. 
tp lament that I ever conceived one ill though t of him.. 
, As we were walking up the feme hilt another day, 
^vhcn the weather being fo hazy at fea that I could' 
i)ot perceive the continent, Fridfty^ (aid I, don't you 
wifti yourfelf to*be in your own country,^ your owa* 
nation,, among your old friends and acquaintance f 
Tes, faid he, me much O glad to be at tny own nation* 
And what would you do there, Friday ? faid I, would

It was from this time, indeed, I had ftrong incli- 
nations to venture ever, and ufe my utmoft efForts^ 
if pninhlc, to join thcfc whico bearded men, who un- 
doudtedly were Spahiianis or Portuguife : For (thought 
I ) it mult be certainly a better and fafer way to efcapc. 
when there is a good company, than for me alone, 
from an iflaiid forty miles off tlie fhorc, and without- 
any afliflancc. Some days after, Friday and I being 
at work as ufual, at the fame time diverting ourfelves 
with various difcourfcs, I told him I had a boat.which 
I would bcftbw upon him, wlicncvcr he plcaf^d to re- 
turn to liis own n.iticn : Ai -i, to convince him of the 
truth of what 1 fa:d, I took him with me to the other

forfear of adifcovery) we both wint into .r, tj Le

again as I ceuld. Well now, friJfiy^ nVid I) fhull 
dvegoto your fo much defircd nation ? Hut izilLad of 
Meting with that chcarfulncfs I expedcrd, he looiccd 
Iftry dull and melancholy at my faying fu; which in* 
deed at firft furprized me,' till he made mc fciifiblc, that 
Hk concern was about the boat's being too fmall t'> 

F> ib'&r a voyage. Upon which I let him undcrftanx. 
had a much bigger; and accordingly the next day, 
^vtrntto the place where the firft boat lay which I had 
made, when all the ftrength I had, or art could ufe, 
(ailed me in my attempt to get it into the water 1 but 
dow, it having lain in the fun two and twenty years, 
md no care being taken of it a^l that while, it be- 
came in a manner rotten. My man told me, that fuch 
1 boat would do very well for the purpofe ; fufiicicnt 
to carry enough vlttle, dring^ bread ^ for that was his 
manner of talking. In fhurt, my mind being; ftrong- 
ly fixed upon iny dcfign of going over with him to 
the continent, I very plainly told him that we would 
both go and make a boat full us big, and more pro- 
portionable than that, wherein he might fafely return 
to his own nation. 

Thcfc words I obfcrved made Friday look fo very 
pcnfive, that 1 thought he would have fallen at my feet. 
It was fometimc before he would f()eak a word, which 
nyde nie^ask him what was the matter with him f He 
replied, in a very foft and moving tone, what has poor 
Friday done ? Why are you angry mad with poor fervant? 
IVhai me dont^ O, what me done ? Friday^ faid I, you 
never yet have offended me, what makes you think I

.frcm him. And here I cannot but take notice of the 
ftrong Tics of Friendlhip, which many times furpals 
thofe of Confanguinity : For often we find a great 
'difagreemcnt among kindred ; and when there is ?ny 
fceming Regard for each other, *tis very feldom true, 
and fcarce ever lafting, if powerful intereft does not 
bear the fway ; and that alone is often the occafion 
of the greatcft hatred in the World ; which is to de- 
firc the death of parents and relations, for the fake 
<6f enjoying their fortunes : But here was no fuch 
thing between my Servant and «ie ^ inftead of which« 

there 



[ us ] 

Aere was nothing but gratitude, and the finccrcd love : 
He found me not only his deliverer, but his profcrvcr 
and comforter : Not afcvcrc and cruel tyrant, but a 
kind loving, and affable friend. He wanted tor no 
manner of fuftcnance ; and when he was ill, or out 
of order, I was his phyfician, not only fur hi:> bmly, 
but his foul ; and therefore no wonder was it, that 
'fuch an innocent creature, long fuicc divcllcd of his 
former natural cruelty, fhould have an uncommon 
concern at (o cruel a fep-ratjon from mc, which 
pierced him to the very foul, and made him ddirc 
. even to die rather than live without mc. 

After I had told Friday^ in a very ciir-jlcf'* mar.ncr, 
that he (houJd be at his liberty as foon ws, the hvM was 
made, the language of his eyes ex pre fled all inimugi lia-

ntm a much better and cleaner way to make a canoe* 

than ever he knew bcfofw- : Forhc \v.is i'or burning' the 
hoUo^^ or cavity of the tree, in orJer to m«kc this 
boat ; but I than told him how we might do it with 
tools, learning him at the fsitnc time how toul'e them, 
which indeed he diJ very doxtcrouflv j fo that in a 
Month's labour, we fini/h*;d it, making It very hand- 
finne by cutting the outfidc into the true fhapc of a 
boat. After this it took us full a fortni«-ht before wc 
could get her into the water, which wc did as it were, 
inch by inch, upon- great rowlcrs: But when Ihc was 
in, fhc would have carried twenty men with all the" 
Cue immaginable. 

As I Was very well pleafed, you may be furc, at the 
fftunching of this man of war of mine, I was nolcfs 
smazcd to behold with what dexterity my man would 
manage her, turn her and paddle her along. Well, 
Friday y faid I,, what do you think of it now ? Do you 
think this will carry us over ? Yes Majier^ faid he, im 
vtnture over well, tho^ great lloiu iviftd. But ray dc- 
figh was yet farther, which he was infenfible of, and 
that was to make a maft and fail, and to provide her 
with an anchor and cable. As for a maft, that was 
no difficult thing at all to procure ; fo 1 fixed upon a 
ftrait young cedar-tree, which I found ne-ar the pbce, 
there abounding great plenty of it in the ifland- j and- 
fcttin^ Frsdi'iy to cut it down, I gave him particular 
direftions how to fhape and order it ; but as to the 
fail, that belonged to me only. I very well knew I 
had fomc old ones, or pieces of faik, enough, which 
had lain fix and twenty years by me ; but not being 
careful to prefervc them, as thinking I fhould have 
no occafion to ufe them any more j when I came to 
Took over them, I found them almoft all rotten, ex- 
cept two J and with th«fe I went to work, and after 
a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious ftltching, 
for want of needles, I finifticd at length a three- 
cornerM udy thing, like what we call in England a 
ihoulder of mutton fail, to go with a boom at bot- 
N 2 tom.

torn, and a little fmall fprit at the top, like thofe 
which our long boats ufe, and which I very well knew 
how to^ manage ; efpecially fince it was like that 
which I had in my patron's fifhing-boat, when, with 
my boy Xmy^ I made my efcape from the Barbarj 
fbore. 

It was near two months, I think, before I completed 
this work, that is, the rigging and fitting my mail and 
fails ; and indeed they were nicely done, having made 
a fmall ftay, and a (ail or forefail to it, to affift, if ! 
we fhould turn to the weftward; and, which was ftill 
more, I fixed a Rudder to the flern of her, to ftcer 
with ; and tho' I was but a very indifierent fhipwright, 
yet, as I was fenfible of the great ufefulnefs and aSfo- 
lute necciEty of a thing like this, I applied myfclf 
to it with fuch a conftant application, that at lafl lac- 
complifhed my defign, but what with the many dull 
contrivances I had about it, and the failure of many 
things, it cofl me as much pains in ordering, as in 
making the boat. Befides, when all this was done, I 
had my man Friday to teach what belonged to its na- 
vigation : For tho' he very well underflood how to pad- 
dle a canoe along, yet he was an utter ftranger to a 
fail and a rudder, and was amazed when he faw me 
work the boat too and again in the fca by the fame, 
and how the fail gibbed and filled, this way, or that 
way, as the courfe we failed changed. After fome 
time, and a little ufc, I made all thefe things very 
familiar to him, fo that he became an expert failor, ex- 
cept in relation to the compafs ; and that I could make 
him underftand but very little of. But as it happened 
there was fcldom occafion for it, there being but little 
cloudy weather, and fcarce ever any fog in thofe parts 5 
the ihrs were always vifible in the night, and the fhore 
pcrfpicuous by day, except in the rainy feafon, which 
confined every one around them, to their habitations. 

7'hus entered in the feven and twentieth year of 
my reign, or captivity, which you pleafe, (the lalt three 
of v/hich, bleflcd with the company of my man Friday^ 

ought 



C »49 1 
f«i^t not to-be reckoned) I kept the^nniverfary of my 
kuiding kere» with the fame thankfuliiefs to (jod, for 
his-tttnder mercies, as I did before j and cert.iinly, .is 
I had a great caufe for a thankful acknowledgement 
for my deliverance at firft, I had much greater now, 
fiorfuch Angular and additional teftimonics of the care 
of Providence over me, in all my diflrcfles, both of 
body and mind, and the gixat hopes I had of being 
efFeCtually and fpeedily dciivered -, for I had a itrong 
imprcffion upon my mind, that I fhould not be ano- 
ther year in this lAand': But however I illll continued 
i^n with my huibandry, digging, planting and fencing 
as ufual : Gathering and curing nw. grapes, and do- 
1jj% all other things that were ncccflary for mc. 

And now the r^iiny feafon beginning to come upon 
me, obliged me to keep the longer within doors ; buc 
before this I brought my new vcfTcl into the creek, 
where I had landed my rafts from the (hip, and hail- 
ing her up to the fhore, I ordered my man Friday to 
dig a dock fufKcient to hold her in, and deep enough 
to give her vwitcr, wherein fhe might float ; and then,, 
when the tide was out, we made a itrong dam acrofs 
the end *of it, to keep up the water ; by which 
means (he lay dry, as to the tide from, the lea ; and 
to keep. the rain. from her, we thatched her over, as- 
it were, with boughs of trecs,^ like, a houfe; and fo 
waited for the months o( November and December ^ aw 
which I defigncd to venture over the oce;m. 

No fooner did the feafonable weather begin to draw 
^ near, but fo much was I elevated by this newdcfi^ned 
' adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. Thj 
ilrft thing I thought of was, to lay by a certain quan- 
tity of provifions, as a fufficient (lore for fuch an ex^ 
psdition, intending in a week or fortnight's time to 
open the dock md liunchiout tl\c boat for that pur- 
pofe. But one morning, as I was very buly upon 
fomcthing nccefTary for this occafion, I call;;d Friday 
to me,, and bidbim go to the fea-fhorc, and kz if he 
N 3 could.

could find a turtle or tortoife, a tiling which we 
commonly had once a week, as much i^pon account 
of the eggs, as for fake of the fle/h. He had not , 
been long gone, but he came running back, as though 
he wus purfu«d for life, and, as it were, flew 'over my 
outward wall or fence, like one that felt not the 
ground, or ftcps he fet his feet on ; and before I had 
time to enquire the reafon of his precipitation, be 
cries out, O Mqfter ! O dear Mafter ! O forroWy fir- 
row I had! O bad! Why, what's the matter, Fri- 
day ? faid I. O yonder^ yonder^ faid he, ihert be fl«, 
two three canoes ! two, three ! Surely (thought I) 
there muft be fix by my man's way of reckoning j 
but on ^ ftrifter enquiry, I found there was but tbrx 
Well, Fridayy faid I, don't be terrified, I warrant you 
we will not only defend ourfelves againft them, but 
kill the moft of thofe cruel favages. But tho' I com- 
forted him in the beft manner I could, the poor crea- 
ture trembled fo, that I fcarce knew what to do with 
him : O Mafter^ fays he, they come look Friday, oA 
pieces Fridaj, eat a me up. Why, Friday ^ faid I, 
they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is 
as great as yours. But fmce it is fo, we muft refolvc 
to fight for our lives : What fay you ? can you fight, 
Friday ? Tes^ faid he very faintly, me Jhoot^ me kill 
what I can, hut there come great many number. That's 
no matter, faid I again, our guns v^ill terrify thofe 
that we do not kill : I am very willing to ftand by you 
till the laft drop of my blood \ now tell me, if you will 
do the like by me, and obey my orders in whatfoever 
I command ? Friday then anfwered, O Majler^ me loje 
life for you, me die when you bid die. Thus conclud" 
ing all queftions concerning his fidelity, immediately 
I fetched him a good dram of rum, (of which I baa 
been a very good huftand) and gave it him to com-* 
fort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him 
to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always car- 
ried, and load them with large fwan ibot as big as 

fmall 



[ 151 1 
Anall piftol bullets i then I took four mufkcts, and 
loaded them with two flugs, and five (mall bullets 
each, charging my two piitols each with a brace, I 
hung my great fword, as cuftomary, naked to my fide, 
and gave Friday his hatchet, as a moil certain we^pdn 
of defence. 

Thus' prepared, I thought, as well as any Knight- 
errant that ever handled a (word and fpcar, I took 
my perfpciSive glafs, and went up to the iide of the 
hill, to fee what I could difcover ; and i perceived 
very foon, by my glaft, that there was one and twenty 
favages, three prifoners, and three canoes ; and that 
their chief concern feemed to be the triumphant ban- 
quet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing which 
by this time 1 had obfcrved was very conunon with 
them. From hence I alfo remarked, that they did not 
land at that place from whence Friday made his efcape, 
but nearer to the creek, where the fhore was low, and 
where a thick wood came very clofe to the fea. And 
then it was my foul was filled with indignation and 
abhorrence of fuch inhuman wretches, that put a 
period to all my former thoughts in their vindication ; 
neither would I give myfelf time to confider their 
right of conquefl, as I had done before. But, defcend- 
ing from the mountain, I came down to Friday^ and 
told him, I was refolved to go fpeedily to them and 
kill them all ; afking him again in the fame breath, if 
he would flaiid by me ? When by this time being re- 
covered from his fright, and his fpirit much chcared 
with the dram I had given him, he was very pleafant, 
yet ferioufly telling me, as he did before, ' w)ien I bid 
die, he would die.' 

And no^ it was, that having»fixed my refolution 
in fo ftrong a manner, that nothing could divefl my 
breaftfrom its uncommon fury, I immediately divided 
the arms already charged between us. To my man 
Friday J J gave a piftol to flick in his girdle, with three 
guns upon his iboulder, a v^eight too great I confefs 

to 



to bear ; but what mud a poor Kingdo^ who had but 
»nc loUier in the world ? But to mew I made bim 
bear no moix> than what I would lay on myfelf, I ftuck 
the other pittol in my girdle,, and the three g«c» up- 
on my ihouldors^ nuy fomething more, but that was 
like .f.V>,^'s burthen, a fmall bottle of mm, which 
ftvMi was lightened to our exceeding refrdhment 
^rhus we marched out, under a ponderous load of ar- 
nunir^ wt, like two invincible champions, v/ith a quan- 
tKyofVinvdcr and bullets to Aand our battle, when 
the i>ieies wtre dilcharged. And. now my orders be-" 
in:\ to be obeyed, I ch;irged Friday to keep clofe behind 
me, And not to iHr^ or inoot, or attempt any thing tHl 
1 \ \>mm:mdeJ him ; and, in the interim, not to fpeak 
ti^ much as one woxd. It wa» in this order I-fotched 
M com (MIS to my ri^ht hand, of near a mile, as well 
to j^ct o\er the crvick, as to attain the wood ;- and by

nothing at all to me, who had no concerns with them. 
Indeed my man Friday might juftify himillf, l.ccauic 
they were his declared enemies, of that very Ininc na- 
tion that went to facrificc him before ; and indeed it 
was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not 
fay was fo in refped to me. So warmly did thcfe 
things prcfs upon my thoughts all the way I went, 
that I only refolved to place myfcif fo, as to behold 
their bloody entertainmcn^, without falling upon t^m, 
except fomething, more than ordinar)-, by God's fpc- 
cial diredion, ihould oblige me thereto. 

Thus fixed in my rcfolution, I entered into the thick 
wood (my man Friday following me clofe behind) 
when, with all pofliblc warinefs and filencc, I marched 
till I came to the fkirt of it, on that fide which was 
the neareft to them ; for only that one end of the wood 
interpofed between me and tnem. Upon which I called 
very foftly to Friday^ and fhcwcd him a great tree, 
that was juft at the corner of the wood, I ordered him 
to repair thither, and bring me word, if he could 
plainly'perceive their aftions : Accordingly, he did as I 
commanded him, and came b-.:ick with this mclant hcly 
ftory, that they were all tibout their fire, eating the 
flefli of one of their prifoners ; and that another lay 
bound upon the fand, a little diftant from them, which 
they dcfigned to be their next facrifice ; and this, he 
tpld me, was not one of their nation, but one of thofe 
very bearded men, who v/as driven by a ftorm into 
their country, and whom he had fo often talked to 
me about. You may be fure, that upon hearing this, 
my foul was ready to fink within me; vvhtn af- 
cending up into a tree, I faw plainly by my glafs, 
a white man, who lay upon the beach of tne fca, 
with his hands and feet tied with flags, cr things 
rcfembling rulhes, being covered with cloaths, and 
fcemed to be a European. From the tree where 1 took 
this profpcdt, I perceived another tree, and a thicket 
beyond it, about fifty yards lu^arer to them, than 

where 



. C 154 T 
where I was, which, by taking a fmall circle round,,! 
might come at undifcovercd, and then I fhould be 
within half a (hot of thefe devourers. And this confi- 
deration alone, to be more perfeft!y revenged upon 
them^ made mc with-hold my paffion, though I was 
enraged to the higheft degree imaginable ;• whcipgeir^ 
back about tv/eoty paces, I got behind fome buflies, 
which held all the way till I came to the other tree ; 
'anc^thcn I afccnded a little rifing ground, not above 
eighteen yards diftance from us,, and there I had st 
full view of thefe creatures, and I could perceive alt 
their aftions. 

Such a fight did then appear, as>dbliged mc not to 
lofe a moment's tin^e. There were no lefs than nine- 
teen of thefe dreadful wretches, fat upon the ground^ 
cloiti huddled together, cxprefling all the delight ima- 
ginable at fo barbarous an entertainment ; and they 
had juft fcnt the other two to murder this poof unhap- 
py Chr'iji'ian^ and bring him perhapfi. limb- by limb to 
their fire ; for they were juft thcii going to untie th« 
bands from his feet, in orJer for death as fetters are 
knocked ofF from the feet of malefaftors before they 
go to the place of e?^ecutiorl. Hereupon immediately 
turning to my man, now, Fj'iday^ faid I, mind what 
I fay, fail in nothing, but do exadlly as you fee me do. 
All- which he promiliKg he would perform, I fet down 
one of my mufkets and the fowling-piece upon the 
ground, and Friday did the f^roe by his ; and with the 
other mufket I took my aim at the favages, bidding 
him do the like : Are you ready } faid I, Yes, Mafterj 
faid he. Why then hre at them, faid I ; and that very 
moment I gave fire likewife. 

For my part, I killed one, and wounded two; butmy 
man Friday taking his aim much better than I, killed 
two, and wounded three more. You may be fure they 
were in a dreadful conftcrnation^atfuch an unexpected 
difaftor ; and thof- who yet had efcaped our penecsat^ ' 
ing (hot, immediately jumped upon their feet^ but 
were in fuch coufufion, that they knew not which 

way 



viray to run or look^ tiot knowing from whence their 
dc:itru£tion came. We then threw down our pieces; 
ami took up others, giving a fecoud dreadful volley ; but 
•as thev were loaded only with fwan-lhot, or I'mall 
j>iftolDu]letS|We.perceived only two of them fall ; but 
fo msaiy were ^(rounded, that they run yelline and 
.fcrcaming about like mad creatures. Now Friday^ 
Xaid I, lay down^your piece, and take up the mulket, 
and foilow me. He did fo, with great courage, when 
ihewing ouricives to the favagcs^ we gave a great 
ihout, and made direilly to thepo<Jr vifiim, wb«4 
would have been facrificeu,bad not odr firft fire obi ige<^ 
their butchers with three others, tojuBijp into a canoe. 
By my order, Friday fired at thcni, at. which fhot I 
thought he killed them all, by rtafon of their falling to 
the Jbottom of the boat; however he killed two, and 
•mortally wounded a third. In the mean time I cut the 
flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature, 
and lifting him up afkcd him in the Fortugue:ie tongue, 
*IVbat hi %vas ? He anfwered me in Latin^^hrijlianih j 
but fo very weak and faint, that he could fcarce ftand 
or fpeak. Immediately I gave him a dram, and a piece 
of bread to cheriih him, and afkcd him what coun- 
tryman he was ? He faid EfpanioUiy and then uttered 
all the thankfulnefs imaginable for his deliverance. 
Seignior (faid I, with as much SpaniJJ) as I was malter 
-of) let us talk afterwards, but fight now ; here tak« 
•this fword and piftol, and do what you can. And in- 
deed he did fo with A*ch courage and intrqpidity, that 
be cut two of them to pieces in an inttant, (the fa- 
vages not having the power to fly for their lives.) I 
'Ordered Friday to run for thofc pieces we had left at the 
tree, which he broughrt to me with great fwiftnefs, 
and then I gave him my mtifket, while I loaded the 
j-ciL But now there happeiKxl a fiei«oc««counter bc- 
«tween the Spaniard, and one of the (avages, who had 
made at him with one of their wooden fwords ; and

having twice wounded his enemj^ih the head ; };et,

being faint, the Indian had thrown Him upon the 
ground, and was wrefting my ftvord out of his hand, 
which the Spaniard very wifely quitting, drew out his 
piftol, and ihot him through the body, before I could 
come near him, who was running to his afl!ftance. As 
to Friday he purfued the flying wretches with his 
hatchet, difpatching three, but the f eft were too nimble 
for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowling- 
pieces, wounded two, who running into the wood, 
Friday purfued and killed one; but the other, notwith- 
ftanding his wounds, plunged himfelf into the fea, 
and fwam to thofc two who were left in the canoe^ 
which with one wounded, wefe all that efcaped out 
of one and twenty. The account is as follows :

The favages in the canoe worked very hard to get 
out of our reach, and Friday was as eager in purfuing 
them : and indeed I was no Icfs anxious about their 
efcape, left, after the news had htttn carried to their 
people, they ftiould return in multitudes, and deftroy 
us. So being refolved to purfue them, I jumped into 
one of their canoes, and bid Friday to follow me; but 
no fooner was I in, when to my furprize, I found 
another poor creature bound hand and foot for the 
flaughter, juft as the Spaniard hzd been, with very 
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and 
would have helped him up, but he could neither ftand 
nor fpeak, but groaned piteoufly, thinking he was on- 
ly unbound in order to be flain. Hereupon I bid /r/- 
xiay fpeak to him, and-tell him of his deliverance ; 

when 



[ 157 ] 
Tviien pulling out my bottle, I made the poor wretch 
drink a dram ; which, with the joyful news he had 
i:cccived, fo revived his heart, that he fat, up in the 
boat.' As foon as Friday heg^in to hear him fpeak. 
and lookul more fully in his face, it would have moved 
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon tranlports 
of joy J for he kifled him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, 
fung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his 
face and head, then fung and jumped about again, 
like a diftra<Sted creature -, fo that it was a great while 
' before I could make him fpeakto me, or tell me what 
was the matter with him ; but, when he came to the 
liberty of his fpecch, at laft he tcid me, it was his 
father. 

Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee the dutiful 
and tender afFc<flion of this poor favage had to his aged 
parent. He would fit down by him in the boat, open 
his breaft, and hold his father's head clofe to his bo- 
fom half an hour together to nourifh it ; then he took 
his iirnxs and ankles, which were ftiff and numbed 
with binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
hands ; by which means, perceiving what the cafa 
was, I gave him fomc rum, which proved of great 
benefit to him. 

While we were huCy in this aftion, the favages had 
gotten almoft out of ught 3 and happy it was we did 
not purfue them ; for there arofe from tlic north-wcfc, 
which continued all night long, fuch a violent ftorni, 
that I could not fuppofe otherwifc, but that they were 
all drowned. After this I called Friday to me,, and 
afked him, if he had given his father any bread ? He 
fliook his head, and faid, Noney not one bit^ me eat a up 
alhy fo I gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch 
I carried for this end. I likewife gave him adram for 
himfelf, and two or three bunches of raifins for his 
father. Both thefe he carried to him, for he would 
make him drink the dram to comfort him. Away he 
then runs «ut of th« boat as if he was bewitched, with 

O fuch 



l 158 3 " - 

fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that he was out of 
fight as it were in an inftant ; but at his return I per- 
ceived him flackcn his pace, becaufc he had fomething 
in his hand : And this 1 found to be, as he approached 
nearer, an earthen jug to bring his father. fome water 
in, with two more cakes of bread, which he delivered 
into my hands. Being very thirfty myfelf, I drank 
fome of the water, of which, when his father had 
drank fufficicntly, it more revived his fpirits, than all 
the the rum I had given him. 

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to car- 
ry the Spaniard one of the cakes and fome water, who 
was repofing himfelf upon a green place under the 
fhadeof a tree,. but fo weak that though he exerted 
himfelf, he could not ftand upon his feet. Upon 
which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe his ankles 
with rum as he did his father's. But every minute 
he was employed in this, he would caft a wiftiful eye 
towards the boat, where he left his father fitting ; 
when fuddenly, not being to be feen, he flew like 
lightning to him ; and finding he only laid himfelf 
down to eafe his limbs, he returned back to me pre- 
fcntly ; and then 1 fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday 
help him, and lead him to the boat, in order to be 
conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take care of 
him : Upon which. Friday made nothing to take him 
upon his back, and fo carried him to ^he canoe, fetting 
him clofe by his fathcfj and prefently ftepping out 
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the 
fhore fafl:er than I could walk, though the wind blew 
very hard too ; and having brought them fafe to the 
creek, away he runs to fetch the other canoe, which 
. he brought to the creek almoft as foon as I got to it 
by land j when wafting me over, he took our new 

fuefts out of the boat. But fo weak were they, that 
was forced to make a kind of hand-barrow; and when 
I came to my c^ftle, not being willing to make ao 
entrance into my wall, we made them a handfome 
tent, covered with old fails and boughs of trees, 

making 



r '59 ] 

making two good beds of ricc-ftraw, with blankets 
to lie upon and €over them. 7^hus^ like an abiblutc 
King, over fubjeftswho owed their lives unto me, I 
thought myfelf very remarkable, crpccially confideritig 
I had three religions in my kingdom, my man Friday 
being a Proteftant, his father a Pagan, and thcSpaninrd 
a Papift J but I gave liberty of confcience to them all. 

To ^t provifion for my poor weak fubjefts, I or- 
dered Friday to kill mc a yearling goat, wlvich when 
he had done, 1 cut ofF the hinder quarters, and chop- 
ing it int6 fmr-ll pieces, boiled and ftcwed it, putting 
barley Wnd rice into the broth. This I carric-d into 
their tent, fet a table, dined with them mj'felf, ainl 
encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter to his 
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, who fpoke the 
language of the favages pretty well. After dinner I 
ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the 
field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead 
bodies, which'hc did accordingly. 

And now I made /^r/V/^ry enquire of his father, whe- 
ther he thought thofc favages had efcaped the late 
ftorm in their canoe ; and if fo, whether they would 
not return with a power too great for us to rciift ? He 
anfwered,that bethought it impofTible they (hould out- 
live the ftorm, or if they were driven fouthwardly, thoy 
would come to a land where they would as certainly 
be devoured, as if they were drowned in the fca. And 
fijppofe they had attained their own country, the 
Itrangcnefs of their bloody and fatal s^ttack, would 
make them tell their people, that the reft of them were 
killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of 
man, but by two heavenly fpirits (meaning Friday 
and me) who were fent from above to dcftroy them : 
And this, he faid, he knew, becaufe he heard them 
fay the fame to one another. And indeed he was in the 
righton't j for I have heard fmce, that thefe four men 
gave out, that whoever went to that inchanted ifland, 
woujd be deftroyed by fire from the Gods. 

No canoes appearing fome time afteo^ as I expedlod,

my apprehenfions ceafed ; inftead of which riiy for- 
mer thoughts of a voyage took place, efpccially when 
Friday's father affured me I fliould have good ufage 
in his country. As to the Spaniard^ he told me, that 
fix teen more of his countrymen and Portugue%e^ who 
had been (hipwrecked, made their efcape "thither > 
that tough they were in union with the favages, yet 
they were very miferable for want of provifions and 
. Other neceffaries. When I afked him about the par- 
ticulars of his voyage, he anfwered, that their fhip 
was bound from Kto de la Plata to the Havatinay that 
when the (bip was loft, only five men perifhed in th« 
ocean, the reft, having faved themfelves in the boatj 
were now landed on the main continent. And what 
do they intend to do there? faid 1. He replied, they 
. had concerted meafures to efcape hy building them a 
veffel, but they had neither tools or provifions 5 fo 
that all their defigns came to nothing. • Suppofing, 
faid I, I fhouid make them a propofal, ^nd invite 
them hei;e, would they not carry me prifoner to Nevj 
Spain ? He anfwered. No, for he knew them to be 
fuch honeft men as would fcorn to aft fuch inhuman 
bafenefs to their deliverer : That, if I pleafed, he and 
the old favage would go over to them, talk with them 
about it, and bring me an anfwer ; that they ihould 
all fwear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the holy 
facraments ; and that for his part he would not only 
do the fame, but ftand by me to the Jaft drop of his 
blood, fliould there be occafion. 

Thefe folemn aflu ranees made me refolve to grant 
them relief, and to fend thefe two over for that pur- 
pofe : But when every thing was ready, the Spaniard 
raifed an obje6lion which carried a great deal of 
weight in it. Tou know^ Sir^ faid he, that being fonie 
time with you^ I cannot but be fenfible of your Jiock of 
rice and corn^ fufficieyit^ perhaps^ for us at prejent^ hut 
not for thenij Jhould they come over prefeniiy ; much lefs 
to viSJual a vejfel for an intended voyage. Want rmgbt 
be as great an occafton: for "them to dif agree and rebels 



[ i6i ] 

as the Children of Ifrael did againji Gcd himfelfy when 

they wanted bread in the wildente/s : jl^id therefore my 
achice is to wait another harvejiy andy in the mejn timey 

cultivate and improve fome mere latid^ whereby we 
may have plenty of provifionsy in order to execute our 
deftgn. 

This advice of the Spaniard I approved of extreme- 
ly, and fo facisfied was 1 of his fidelity, that 1 cflcemcd 
him ever after. And thus wc all four went to work 
upon fome more land, and againft feed -time wc had 
got as much curved and trimmed up, as wns fufEcicutr 
to fow twenty-two bufheJs of barley on, and fixtccn 
jars of rice, which was in fliort all the fctd we had 
to fpare. As we were 4 in number, and by this time 

. all in good health, wc feared not an liundred Indians^ 
fhould they venture to attack us : And while the corn 
was growing, I pitched upon fome trees fit to build 
us a large vcflcl in cafe the Spaniards came Over ; 
which being marked, I ordered Fi'iday and his father 
to. cut them down, appointing the Spaniard^ who was 
now my Privy Counfcllor, to overl'oe and dircv^t rbc 
work." I likewife encrcakJ my flocks of goats, by. 
fliooting the wild cIhiiis, and bringing home thoir 
kids to my encloiu/ . Nor did I neglect thcgrajje-. 
feafon, but cured themas-ufual, though I had iuch a 
quantity now, as would have filled eighty barrels with 
raifins. Andthus all of us being employed, they in- 
working, and 1 in providing for them, 'till harveft 
came, God Almighty bleflld the increalL* of it fo 
much, that from twenty-two barrels of biirlev, wc 
threfhed out two luhdred and tv/cnty, and t\{^ like 
quantity of rice, futlici'^n: to vi<5bu:il any ihip, to 
carry me and all the Sporiiards ro any part oi j1,}> erica. 
Thus tlK princinal o icdtion being anfwcrcd, by a 
fufEcIcnt ftock i'f provLiiyii, I I'ciit my two ambaflii- . 
dors over to thj m;*in, with a regal authority, to acl- 
minifter the oa lis of allegiance and fidelity, and 
have an iiiftrument figiicd under their h^nds, thougb I

never afked whether they had pen, ink; or paper ; 
when giving ^each of them a mufquet, eight charges 
of powder and ball, and provifion enough for eight 
days,, they failed away with a fair gale, on a day when 
the moon was at full. 

Scarce a fortnight had paft over my head, but im- 
patient for their return, I laid me down to ileep one 
morning, when a ftrange accident happened, which 
was ufhered in, by my man's coming running to me, 
and calling aloud, Jidajhr^ Mafter^ they are come ^ they 
are come. Upon which, not dreaming of any danger, 
out I jumps from my bed, puts on my cloaths, and 
hurries thro' .my little grove, when looking towards 
the fea, I perceived a bo;3t about a league and a half 
diftant, ftanding in for the fhore, with the wind fair* 
I beheld they did not come from thi? fide where the 
land lay on, but from the fouthermoft end of the 
ifland : So thefe being none of the people we wanted, I 
ordered Friday tolieftill, till fuch time as I defcended 
from the mountain, which, with my ladder^ I now af- 
cended, in order to difcover more fully what they were : 
' And now, with the help of my perfpeftive glafs, I 
plainly perceived an Englijh fhip, whici^ I concluded 
it to be, by the fafhion of its long-boat^ and which 
filled me with fuch uncommon tranfportsof joy, that 
I cannot tell how to defcribc ; and yet fome fecret 
doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not 
what caufe, as tho^ I had reafon to be upon my guard. 
And indeed I would have no man contemn the fecrtt 
hints and intimations of danger, which very often 
are given, when he may imagine there is no poffibility 
of its being real : For had I not been warned by this 
filent admonition, I had been in a worfe ftation than 
before, and perhaps inevitably ruined. 

Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to ap- 
proach the fhore, as tho' they looked for a place where 
thpy might conveniently land ; and at lafl they ran their 
boat on Ihore upon the beach, about half a mile dif^ 

tance^ 



. [ 1*3 ] 
tancc, which provc3 fo much the happier for me ; fince 
had they come into the creek, they had landed juft at 
my door, and might not only have forced me out of 
my caftle, but plundered me of all I had in the world. 
Now I was fully convinced they were all Englijhmen^ 
three of which were unarmed and bound ; when im- 
mediately the firft four or five leaped on (hore, and took 
thofe three out of the boat as prilbners. One of whom 
I could perceive ufcd the moft paflionate gcfturcs of 
entreaty, affliftion, and defpair, while the others, in 
a leffer degree, (hewed abundance of concern. 

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much 
aftoniihed, and! beckoned to Friday^ (who was be- 
low to afcend the mountain, and likewife view this 
fight. O Majier^ fays he to me, you fee Englifli mans 
eat prijhnersy as well as favage mans. And do you think 
they will eat them, Friday ? faid I. Yes^ faid Friday^ 
they eat a all up. No, no, faid I Friday^ I am much 
more concerned leaft they murder them j but as for 
eating them up, that I am fure they never will. 

And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not 
having the Spaniard znd Savage with me, but alfo that 
I ^ould not comie within fhot of them unperceived, 
(they having no fire-arms among them) and fave thefc 
three men, whom I thought they were going to kill with 
their fwords. But fome comfort it was to me, that 
I perceived they were fet at liberty to go where they 
pleafed, the rafcally feamen fcattering about as tho* they 
had a mind to fee the place : And fo long did they 
negligently ramble, that the tide had ebbed fo low, as 
to leave the boat aground. Nor were the two men 
that were in her more circumfpeft, for having drank 
a little too much liquor, they fell faft afleep ; but one 
of them waking before the other, and perceiving the 
boat too faft a-ground for his ftrength to remove it, he 
^alloo'd out to the reft, who made all pofTible cxpc- 
tion to him : But, as Providence ordered it, all their 
force was ineftci^ual to launch her, when I could hear 

thcin 



[ . i64 1 . 
them fpeak one to another, Wl)y^ let her alone. Jack, 
carit ye, fln^ II float next tide \ by which words I was 
fully confirmed that they were my own countrymen. 
All this while I lay very quiet, as being fully fenfible, 
it could be no lefs than ten hours before the boat 
would be afloat, and then it would be fo dark, as that 
they could not eafily perceive me, by which means I 
.fhould be at more liberty to hear their talk, and ob- 
ferve all their motions : Not but that I prepared for my 
defence before ; yet as I had now another fort of ene- 
mies to combat with, I aded with more caution. I 
took two fuzees on my fhoulders, wid gave Friday 
three muficcts j befides my formidable goat-ikin coat, 
and monftrous cap, made me look as fierce and ter- 
rible as Hei'cuks of old, efpecially when two piftols 
were ftuck ui my belt, and my .naked fword. hanging 
by my fide. 

It was my defign at firft not to make any attempt 
till it was dark ; but it being now two o'clock, in the 
vcr)' heat of the day, the failors were all fbraggling into 
the woods, and undoubtedly were lain down to flecp. 
The three poor diftrcfled creatures, tOQ anxious to get 
any repofe, v/ere however feated under the ftiade of 
a great tree, about a quarter of a mile from me: 
Upon which, v/ithout any more ado, I approached to- 
wards them, with my mail following behind me, and 
before I was perceived, I called aloud to thOm ia Spa- 
nijh. What are ye Gentlemen ? 

At thefe words they ftarted up \n great coixfuCon, 
and, beholding the ftrange figure I made, they returned 
no anfwer, but feemed as irthey would fly from me. 
Ger.tUtnen, (faid I, in Englijh) don^t he afraid : Perhapi 
you have a friend nearer yqu than you expeSf^ He muft 
be from He;iYcn, faid one of them gravely, and pulling 
offlm hat^ for we are pafl: all help in this world. All 
help is from Heaven, faid I -, hut. Sir, as I have per- 
ceived every a5iion hetwccn you and thofe brutes, fwce 

your 



ytiUf Imding^ only inform me how to ajjift you^ and 1 wHl 
do it to the utmojl of my tower. 

Am I talking with 6od or man (faid he, in nuelting 
tears) Are you of human-kind, or an Angel ! &ir^ 
faid I, my poor habit may tell you I am man^ and an 
Englifliman,'it;i7/r«^ to ajftft you^ having but thisfer- 
vant only : Heie are arms and ammunition : Tell freely 
your condition^ can 'we fcrve you : The ftory, faid he, 
is too long to relate, fmce our butchers are fo near ? 
But, Sir, I was maftcr of that fhip, my men have 
mutin)'ed, and it is a favour they have put my mate, 
this paflenger, and me, on fhore, without murdering 
us, tho' we expcdl nothing but to perifti here. Are your 
Enemies gem? faid I. No replied he, (pointing to a 
thicket), there they lie, while my heart trembles, left 
having feen and heard us, they mould murder us all. 
Have they fire-arms? faid I. They have but two 
pieces, faid he, one of which is left in the boat : He 
told me there were two enormous villains among 
them, that were the authors of this mutiny, who if 
they were killed or fcized, might induce the reft tore- 
turn to their obedience. Well, well faid I, let us 
retire farther under the covering of the woods \ and 
there it was I made thefc conditions with him : 

I. That while they flayed in the ifland, they fliould 
not pretend to any authority ; but be entirely con- 
formable to my orders, and return me the arms, which 
I fhould put into their hands. 

If. That if the (hip v/as recovered, they fliould 
afford Friday and I our piflagc gratis to England, 

When he had given me all the fatisfafiion I could 
dcfire, I gave each of them a gun, with powder and 
ball fuificient, advifing them to fire upon them as they 
lay. The captain modeftly faid, That he was ferry to 
kill them, tho* on the other hand, to let thefe villains 
efcape, who were the authors of his mifery, might be 
the ruin of us all, fhould they bring the Ihip's com- 
pany upon us. Well, faid Ij^ ao as you think fit : And 



. [ i66 J , 

fo accordingly fired, killingone of the Captain's chiefeil 
enemies, ana wounded the other, who eagerly called 
for aflillancc ; but the captain, (who had referved his 
piece) coming up to him. Sirrah, faid he, 'tis too late 
to call for ajffijlance^ you jhould rather cry to God to tar- 
don your vulainy \ {o knocked him down Vith the ftock 
of his gun : Three others were alfo flightly wounded, 
who, at my approach, cried out for mercy. This the 
captain granted, upon condition that they would fwear 
to be true fo him in recovering theihip, wbrch they 
folemnly did ; however I oWigcd the captain to keep 
them bound. After which I fent Friday and the cap- 
tain's mate to fecure the boat, and bring away the oars 
and fail ; when at their return, three men coming 
back, and feeing their late diftrefs'd captain, now their 
conqueror, fubmitted to be bound alfo. And then it 
was, that having more liberty, I related the adven- 
tures of my whole life, which he heard with a ferious 
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him 
and his two men into my little fortified caftle, fhewed 
them all my conveniences, and refrefhed them with 
fuch provifipns as I could afford. When this was over, 
we began to confider about regaining the fhip. He faid, 
that there were 26 hands on board, who knowing 
their lives were forfeited by the law, for confpiracy 
and mutiny, would grow fo very hardened, that it 
would be dangerous for our fmall company to attack 
them. This was a reafonable inference indeed; but 
fomethingwe did refolve on, and immediately put in 
execution : For we heaved the boat upon thq beach 
lb hign, that (he could not fhoot off at high-water 
mark, and broke a hole in her, not eafily to be flop- 
ped ; and fo all the fignals they gave for the boat to 
come on board were in vain. This obliged them to 
fend another boat afhore, with ten men arnxicd, 
whofe faces the captain plainly defcried, the boat- 
fwain being the chief officer ; but he faid there were 
three honeft lads among them, who were forced iaQ 
the confpiracy. Hereupon I gave him freih coiirago 
^ (for 



C 1^7 ] 
(For I liad perceived he was in concern) in the mean 
while fecuring our prifoners, part in my caftlc, over 
whom Friday flood ccntincl ; but two others we took 
into our fcrvice, and then thought ourfclvcs ftrong 
enough to adventure a battle. When the Tailors land- 
ed, and beheld their boat in that condition^ they not 
only halloo'd, but fired for their companions to hear, 
yet they received no anfwcr. This ftruclc them with 
horror and amazement, thinking their companions 
were murdered ; then they made as if they would return 
to the fhip \ I could perceive the captain's counte- 
nance change at this, till of a fudden three men were 
ordered to look after the boat, while the other fevcn 
leaped on (hore, in order to fearch for their compa- 
nions : And indeed they came to the brow of the hill, 
near my antient caftle, from whence they could fee a 
great way into the woods, and there fhouting and 
hallooing till tired and weary, at length feated thcm- 
felves under a fprcading tree. My opinion was, that 
nothing could be done till night, when I might ufe 
fome artifice to get them out of the boat : But of a 
fudden they all ftarted up, and made to the fca-fide : 
Hereupon 1 ordered Friday and the captain's mate to 
go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, 
and fo, decoying them into the woods, come round 
to me again. And this i ndecd had its effeft ; for thqy 
followed the noife, till coming wcftward to the creek, 
they called for their boat to carry them over, taking 
one of the men out of her, and leaving two to look 
after her, having fattened her to the flump of a little 
tree an Ihore. Hereupon immediately the captain 
and our party, pafling the creek out of their light, 
wc furprizcd thera both, by the captain's knocking 
down one, and ordering the other to Surrender on pain 
of death, and who, being the honcfteft of them all, 
fincerdy joined with us. By this time it was pretty 
late, when returning to their boat, v/hich they Ibund 
a-ground in the creek, the tide out, and the men 
^ne^ they xan about, wringing their hands, crying 



[ x68 ] 

It was an inchanted ifland, and that they flipuld be all 
murdered by fpirits or devils. My men would wil- 
lingly have fallen upon them, but I would not agree 
to hazard any of our party. But to be more certain, 
Friday and the captain crawled upon their hands and 
feet, as near as poffible ; and when the boatfwain 
approached in fight, fo eager was the captain, that he 
fired and killed him on the ipot; Friday wounded 
the next man, and the third ran away, Hereujjon, I 
advanced with my whole army, and, it being dark, I 
ordered the man we had furprized with the boat, to 
call them by their names, and to parley with them. 
Accordingly he called out aloud, Tom Smith! Tom 
Smith ! He anfwered, TVho's that ? Robinfon ! The 
other anfwered, For God's fake^ Tom, furrf'ender im- 
mediately^ or you are all dead men. Who muft we 
furrcndcr to ? fays Smith. To aur captain and fifij 
men here^ who have taken me prifoner^ wounded Will 
Frye, and killed the boatfwain. jShall we have quar- 
" ters then ? faid he. Hereupon the captain calls out, 
Tou^ Smith, you know tny voic^; furrender immediateljj 
and you Jhall all have your lives granted^ except Vf\\\. 
Atkins. Hereupon y//^//7J cried out. What have I done^ 
captain^ more than the rejl^ who have been as bad as me? 
But that was a lie, for he was the pcrfdn that laid 
hold of him, and bound him. However, he was or- 
dered to fubmit to the Governor's mercy, fox fuch 
was I called. And fo, laying down their arms, we 
bound them all, and fcized on their boat. 

After this, the captain expoftulated with them, tell- 
ing them, that the Governor was an EngUJhman^ who 
mtght execute them there ; but he thought they would 
be fent to England^ except JVill. Atkins^ who was or- 
dered to prepare for death next morning. Hereupon 
Atkins implored the captain to intercede for his life, 
and the reft that they might not be fent to England. 
Thus anfwered our project for feizing the fhip. For 
fending yf//^/«j, and two of the worft, faft bound, to tbc 
cave, and the reft being committed to my bowcTi I fent

the captain, to tamper with them, in the Governor'! 
name, oftcring them pardon, if thev would aflifl him 
in recovering the (hip. Upon which they all promifcd 
to ftand hy liim till their I:irt drop or Wooti ; and 
whoever a<Scd treachcroufly fliould be hanged in chains 
upon the beach. They were all releafca on thefc af- 
furanccs ; -and then the captain repaired the other 
boat, making his pafTcnger captain, with four men 
well armed ; while his mate, himfcif, and five men 
more, went in the othen By midnight tbey came 
within call of the (hip, when the captain ordered Ro- 
tin/on to hale her, and tell them 'that, with great dif- 
ficulty, they had found the men at lad. ant while 
they were diicourfmg, the captain, his mate, and the 
reft entered, and knocked down the fecond mate and 
carpenter, fccurcd thofc that were upon deck, by put- 
ting them under hatches, while the other boat's 
crew entered, and fecured the forecaftlc ; then broke 
into the round*houfe, where the mate, after fome 
rcfiftance, (hot the pirate captain through the licad ; 
upon which all the reft yielded themfilvcs pri Toners. 
And thus the (hip being recovered, t)ie joyful fignal 
was fired, which I heard with the grcatcj^ joy i«nagi- 
nable : Nor was it long before he brought the (hip ta 
an anchor at the creek's mouth, when cotTiing to mc 
unawares, Ticre^ fays he, my dtarcft frund and deli- 
verer^ there is your Jbip^ and we are your j>r":njti ; a 
comfort (o unfj^eakable, as made mc fwocii in his 
arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten- 
derly embracing each other. 

Nothing now remained, bnt to confuh what we 
(hould do with the prifoners, two of which he thought 
not fafe to take on board. Hereupon, concerting with 
the captain, I dreiled myfclf in one of his fuits, and 
fending for them, told them, that as I was gc^ing to 
leave tne ifland with all my people, if they would tarry 
there, their lives (hould be fpared ; if not, they (hould 
be hanged at the firft port we came to. They agreed 
to ibiy. Hereupon I told them my whole iiory, charge

Friday went on board. But the next>morning t^'oof 
the men came fwimming to the fhip's fide, dcfiring 
the captain to take them on board, though he hanged 
them afterwaords, complaining mightily how barbarouilj 
the others ufed them. Upon which I prevailed with 
the captain to take them in, and being fevcrely whip- 
ped and pickled, they proved more honcft for the fu- 
ture. And fo I bid farewcl to this ifland, carrying 
along with me my money, parrot, umbrella, and goat- 
fkin cap, fetting fail Die, I2, i686, after twenty- 
eight years, two months, and nineteen da)^ refidence, 
that ^me day and month that I efcaped from Selltey 
landing in England^ June ii, 1687, after thirty-five 
)rears abfence from my own country, which rendered 
me altogether an utter ftranger. 

Here I found my Arft captain's widow alive, \A\Q 
had buried a fecond hufband, but in very mean cir* 
cumftances, and whom I made mighty eafy upon my 
account. Soon after I went down to Yorkjl/irty where 
all my family were expired, except two fitters, and 
as many of one of my brother's children. I found no 
provifion had been made for me, they concluding I 
had been long fince dead; fo that I was but in a very 
flcndcr fituation. Indeed the captain did me a great 
kindncfs, by his report to the owners, how I had de- 
livered their ihip on the defolate ifland, upon which 
they made me a prcfent of 20cl. fterling. 1 next went 
to Lijboriy taking mv man Friday with me, and arriv- 
ing there in Aprils 1 met the Portugueze captain, who 
tookmc on board on ih^ African coaft; but being an- 
ticnt, he had left off the fea, and refigned all his bufi- 
liefs to his fon, who followed the brttfil trade. So 
altered both of us were, that we did not know each 
other at firil, till I difcovered myfelf more fully to 
bim. After a few embraces, I begun to enquire after my 
concerns, and tlien the old gentleman told me, that 

it 



f '7' T 

it was nine years fince he bad becn^at Brajil^ where mj 
partner was then living, but my truftces were botb 
dead ; that it was his belief, I fhould have a good ac- 
count of the produ^ of my plantation ; that the ima- 
gination of my being loft, had obliged my trudees to> 
give an e{Kmate of my (hare to the Procurator Fifcul^ 
wiio, in cafe of my not returning, had given one third 
to the King, and the reft to the Monafiry of St. Au* 
gujUne \ but if I put in my claim, or any one for me, 
it would be returned, except the yearly product, \»hiclv 
was given to the poor. I then dcilred him to tell me^ 
wlmt improvement he thought had been made of my 
plantation, and whether he imagined it was wortn 
my while to look after it ? He anfwcrcd,, he did imt 
know how much Jt was improved,, but this he was cer- 
tain of, that my partner was grown vaftly rich upon 
^his half of it ; and that he had oeeu informed, that the 
King had 200 moidores per annum, for his third part. 
He added, that the furvivors of my truftces were per- 
sons of an ingenuous charatSler \ that my partner could 
witnefs my title, my name being regiftered in the 
country,, by which. means indifputably I fhould recover 
confidcpable fums of money. But, anfwcred I, h(nv 
could my truftces* difpofe of my cftefls, v/hen I made 
you only my heir ? This, he fai'd, was true, but there 
being no affidavit made of my death, he could not aft 
as an executor. However he had ordered his fo2, 
(then at Brcfil) to a<5t by procuration upon my ac-- 
count, and had taken poflcflion of my I'ugar-houfe,. 
having accountcl himfelf for ei^ht years with my^ 
partners and truftcjs for the profits, of which he 
would give me a* gcf>d account.. 

And indeed this he performed very faithfully in a 
fcu^ days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 moi- 
dores of gold, over and above what had been loft at 
fea, after f had left the place. And then he recounted 
to me what misfortunes he had gone thro*, which forced 
my money out of his hands, to buy part in a new (hip : 
But (fays \kQ) you Jhallmt want ^ iaki thk^ and when my

wriich lie piK into iny hand a purie of 150 moidorcs 
in gold, as likewifc the inflrumcnt containing tiw 
title to the (hip in which his fon was, and which he 
offered as Security for the remainder. But really 
when I f:iw (o much goodnefs, generofity, tendcr- 
nefs and real honcily, I had not the heart to accept it, 
for fear he fliould ftraighten himfelfon my account. 
*7i'j /rwr, fatd he, // may dj fo ; hut the money is youn^

However *I returned fifty of them, promifing to give 
him the other hundred, when I got my efFecls in my 
hands, faying I defigned togomyfelf for that purpole. 
l>ut he told me, he could fave me that trouble \ and 
i(i caufed me to enter my name with a public notary, 
as likewife mv affidavit, with a procuration fixed u^ 
it ; and he adrifed me to fend in a letter to one of 
his acquaintance, a merchant at Braftl\ and indeed 
nothing could be more faithful and honourably, ob- 
fcrved ; for in i^ytn months time I had a very faithful 
account of all my cfiidls, what fums of money were 
laifcd, what expended, and what remained K>r my 
ufe : In a word, I found myfelf worth 4000I. fter- 
ling, and lool. per annum. Norv/ns this all, for my 
partner congratulated mc upon rjy being alive, telling 
me hew much my plantiitiou was improved, what ne- 
giocs were at work, and iiow many Ave Afarias he 
had faid to the Virgin Afury for ray prefcrvatiofi, de- 
firing me to accept kindlv iome prcfents he had fent 
mc, which I found fliewcd the greateft generofity. 

No fooner did the fliip arrive, but I rewarded my 
faithful captain, by returning him the hundred moi- 
dores ; and not only forgiving him all he owed me, I 
allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his 
fon, during their lives. And now being refolved to 
go to England^ I returned letters of thanks to the 
rrior of St. Augujiine^ and in particular to my old 
partner, with very fui table prefcnts. By the captain's 
advice, I was pcrfuadcd to go by land to Calais^ and 

there 



t 173 r 

ihere Ukiei paflage for England: WHen,- ar it hap« 
f)ened, I got a young Englijh gentleman, a merchant's 
Ion at Lijbon^ to accompany me, together with two 
JEnglljh and two Portugutxe gentlemen ; • fo that with 
a Portugixi fervant, an Engli/h failor, and my man 
J^ridny^ there were nine in' number. 

I'hus, armed and equipt, we fet out, and came to 
Afadndy when ttic fummer decaying, we* haftcd to • 
Navarriy where we werp informed diat there was 
fcarcely any pafling, by reafon of the prodigious quan- 
-tity of Snow ; fo that we were obliged to aSide near 
twenty days at Pamf€luna^ and at lait to take a guide 
to coiiduA us fafc towards Thoulmft. And now twelve 
-other gentlemen joining with us, together with their 
-fervants, wc had a verv iolly company. Away our 
£uide led us by the frigntful mountains, and through 
fe many intricatie mazes- and >windings, that we infcnr 
fibly paftthem, which, as we travelled along, ufhercd 
us to the profp«<S of the fruitful and charming; pro- 
vinces of Langued$c:2^A Gaf£9gny. 

B^tinow came on two adventures, both tragical and 
comical, xft. Our guide was encountered by throe 
wolves and a bear, who ki u|K>n him and his horfe, 
.and wounded* him in three places : .Upon which my 
■man riding up to his afiiftance, (hot one of /them dead^ . 
•an. which the others ran into the woods. But the plea^- 
iantoftadvcnture was, to fee my man attack the bear. 
This creatufe, , if let'^lone, will never meddle with 
you: And this my man Friday very well .knew, iuid 
fo begging leave oif me in broken Engli/h^ he told u!>y , 
. Me would make good laugh. Why, vou filly fool, £iid I, 
he'll cat you u^) at a mouthful, kate^ me up ! replied 
h^y me eatee him^ and make much good laugh. Upon, 
which, pulling off his boots, he claps on his pumps, 
and running after the monftrous bcaft, and calls oitf, 
that he wanted to fpeak with him ; and then thtowing 
ftonc6 on purpofe to inccnfe him, the bcaft turns about 
iaa fury, and, with prodigious ftrides, (huffles after 
P^ 3. him.

him. But though he could not keep pace with FrUtf^ 
who made up to us as it were for help, yet, being as- 
gry. You dogy faid I, immediately take herfe^ emdietn 
fioot the creature. But he cried. Dear Afa/ier^ mfiml^ 
me make ym much laugh. And fo he turned abcwti 
making figns to follow, while the bear ran after hinH 
till coming to a great oak^ he afcended in a minutCi 
leaving his gun at the bottom of it* Nor did the beir 
make any difHcuIty of it, bvt, notwithftaading hb 
bulk, afcended like a cat. You muft think fmn 
not a lictlc amazed at the folly of mv man, not pe^ 
cciving any thing to. occafion our laughter, till we 
rode up nearer, and t)ehcld the beaft mounted on the 
oak, on the beginning of the £une branch to whick 
Fridtiy clung at the farther end, where the bear daie 
not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, NoWj Matter^ 
me make much laugh^ me make de bear dance, tfpon 
which he fell a fhaking the bough, which made the 
creature lock behind him to fee how he could retreat. 
Then, as if the bear had underftood his ftammcring 
EngUJh^ Why ypu no come farther ^ Mr, Bear"? faid he. 
Pray Mr, Btc*r^ come farther ; And then indeed we 
all burft liito laughter,, efpecially when we perceived 
Friday drop like a fquirrel upon the ground, leaving 
the bcaft to make the beft of his way down the tree. 
And now :hinkiiig it themoft convenient time to kill 
him, Friday cried out, O dear Majler^ no fhoot ', m 
JhoGt by and ly \ when taking up the gun. Me no Jboet 
yety faid he, me tmtke once more much laugh. And ac- 
cordingly he was as good as his word, for the crea- 
ture descending backwards from the tree veiy leifurely, 
beiorc he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday 
fhot him through the car ftone-dead, and looking to 
fee \i we were plcafcd, burft out into a hearty laugh, 
Ciying, So we kill bear in my country \ not with gun^ 
but much long arrow. Thus ended our diverfion, to 
our great fatisfadtion, ■ efpecially in a place where the 
terrible bowlings llruck us witli continual terror. But 

the

the fiiowf now growing very deep, particularly on the 
mountains, the ravenous ca^atures were obliged to 
leek for fuftcnancc in the villages, where coming by 
furprizcon the country people, killed fcvcral of themy 
beudcs a great number of their (hccp and horfes. 

Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous 
place to pafs by ; and if there were any more wolves 
in the country, there we fliould find them. This was 
a fmall plain, cncompafled with woods, to get through 
a long lane, to tlie vilhige wliere we were to lodge. 
When we entered the wood the fun was within half 
an hour of letting ; and a little after it was fct, we came 
into the plain, which was not above two furlongs over, 
and then we faw five great wolves crofs the road, 
without taking notice of us, and fo fwift as tho' they 
were purfuing after their prey. Hereupon our guide^ 
believing there were more coming, defircd us to be 
upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes were very 
circumfpe<Sr, till about a league farther we faw a dead 
horfe, and near a dozen of wolves devouring its car* 
cifs. My man Friikij fain would have fired at them, 
but I would not pcrmic him : Nor had wc gone lialf 
over the plain, but we heard dreadful bowlings in a 
wood on our left, whan prefc ntly wc faw an hundred 
come up againft us, as though they had been an ex- 
perienced army. This oblif^ed us to form ourfelves 
in the beft manner; and then I ordered that every other 
man (hould fire, that tlioic who did not might be ready 
to give a fecond volley, fhould they advance upon us ; 
and then every man to make ufc of his piibls. But 
th^re was no neceffity ior this ; for the enemy being 
terrified, ftoppt J at the noife of the fire ; four of them 
were ihot dead, and.i'everal others being wounded, 
went bleeding av/ay, as we could very plainly difcovcr 
by the fnow. And now remembering what had been 
often told mc, that (u< i* was the maiefty of a man's 
voice, as to ftrike terror even into the fierccft crea- 
tures, I ordered all our companions to holloo as loud 



[ 176 ] 

as pofliMc : And in this notion I was not altogetkr. 
mifta'f.< j^. ; for they immediately turned about upon dK 
firil h&lloo^ and began to retire : Upon which, «• 
Jcring a iccond volley m their rear, they galloped in- 
to the woods with great precipitation. 

Thus we had fome fmiill time to load ourgfccn 
again, and then made all the hafte we could on our 
way : But we had not rode far before ive were obliged 
to put ourfclvcs in a pofture of defence as beforr, 
beiii^ alarmed with a very dreadful noi(e in the fime 
wood on our left hand, the fame way as we were to 
pafs, only that it was at fome diftance from us. tj 
this time the darkfome clouds began to (pread over, 
the elements, and the light growing very dufkv, madt 
it fo much the more to our difadvantage : ^ut the 
noiie ftill encreafing more, wc were fully aflured, that 
it y>^^ the howling and yelling of thofe ravenous^ 
creatures ; when prefently three troops of wolves,, 
on our front, appeared to our fight, as the* all theft 
companions had a defign to furround us, amd devour 
us in fpite of fate. But as they did not fall upon us 
immediately, we proceeded on our journey in the 
fwifteft manner that the rokids would permit our horfes, 
which was only a large trot. It was in this manner' 
we travelled, till fuch time as we difcovered another 
wood, and had the profpe^t of its entrance, through 
which were to pafs at the fartheft fide of the plain. 
But furely none can exprefs the terror we were in, 
when approaching the lane, ^yc perceived a confuftd 
number of the fierceli: wolves ftanding, and as it were, 
guarding its entrance. Nor were wc long in this 
•amazement, before another occafion of horror prc- 
fented itfclf : For fuddenly we heard the report of a 
gun at another opening into the wood ; and looking 
thut way, outran ahorfe, bridled and faddled, flying 
with the grcatcft fwiftnefs, and no Icfs than /ixtecn 
or Icventccn wolves purfuing him, in order lo devour 
the poor creatufe : And unqu^iftionably they did (o^ 

afUT 






f 177 ] 

after they had run him down, not being capable to hold 
out that fwiftncfs with which he at firft cfcaped them. 
. '^Vhcn we rode up to that entrance from whence 
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcaflcs of two 
men and another horfe, mangled and torn by thcfe 
devouring wolves: And undoubtedly one ot thefe 
men was the perfon who fired the gun, which we 
had heard, for the piece lay by him ; but alas ! moil 
of the upper part of his bcxly and his head was en- 
tombed in the bowels of thcfe ravenous creatures. 

What courfe to take, whether to proceed or retreat, 
t^ could not tell j but it was not Ions before the 
wolves themfelves made us come to a refoTution : For 
fuch numbers furroundcd us, every one of whom ex* 
pedled their prey, that were our bodies to be divided 
among them, there would not be half a mouthful 
a- piece. But happy, very happy, it was for us, that 
but a little way from the entrance, there lay fome very 
large timber trees, which I fuppofed had been cut 
down and lay there for Carriage, among which I drew 
sny little troop, placing ourfclvcs in a line behind 
one long tree, which ferved us for a breafl-work: ; 
when, defiring them to alight, we flood in a triangle, 
or three fronts, encloflng our horfcs in the centre, 
the only place where we could prcferve them. 

Never certainly was a more furious charge than 
what the wolves made upon us in this place ; and the 
fight of the horfes, which was the principal prey the^ 
aimed at, provoked their hunger, and added to their 
natural ficrcenefs. They came on us with a moft 
dreadful noife, that made the woods ring again, and 
beginning to mount our pieces of timber, 1 ordered 
every other man to fire as before dirc£lcd ; and indeed 
ib well did they take their aim, that they killed feveral 
of the wolves at the firft volley 5 but flill we were 
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reafon they 
came oti like devils, pufhins; one another with the 
greatcft fury. But our fccond volley fomething 
abated their courage ^ whcitiloppiiig a little, wc hoped 

^ they 



[ '7« ] I 

thcv would have made the beft of their way, however » 
it aid not proVe lb, for others made a new attempt 
upon us : And tho' in four firings we killed feventeen 
or eighteen of them, laming twice as many ; yet they 
came on fcveral times fucceffively, as though they va- 
lued not their lives for the fake of their prey. 

Unwilling was I to fpend our laft (hot too fuddcnly : 
and therefore called my other fervant, and giving him 
a horn of powder, bid him lay a large train quite 
along the timber, which he did, while Friday was 
charging iny fuzee and his own, with the greateft 
dexterity. By this time the wolves coming up the 
timber, I fet fire to the train, by fnapping a dif- 
charged piftol clofe on the powder. This fo fcorchcd 
and terrified them, that fome fell down, and others 
jumped in ^mong us with the ftrength and terror of 
the fl^e, but thefe we immediately difpatched, when 
all the reft, frightened with the light, which the dark* 
fome pight caufed to appear more dreadful, began at 
length to retire : Upon which, ordering our laft pif* 
tols to be fired at once, giving at the fame time a 
great fliout, the wolves were obliged to ^have rccourfc 
to their fwiftnefs by turning tail i and then we fellied 
out upon twenty lame ones, cutting them in pieces 
with our fwords, which obliged them to howl la- 
mentably, to the terror of their ftllow devourers, who 
rcfigncd to us the field, as i iclorious conquerors. 
And, indeed, I qucftion whether Alexander^ King of 
Macedon^ in any of his conqucfts, had more occafion 
for triumph than we had ; for he was backed by nu- 
merous captains and foldiers of the greateft courage, 
conftancy, and rcfolution ; whereas our little army 
was obliged to combat a legion of devils, as it were, 
worfe than canibals, who, had they flain us, would 
have iacrificed us the fariie moment, to fatisfy their 
voracious appetit.es. 

Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafb, hay.- 
ing killed threcfcore of them, and faved our lives from 
their fury. We ftill had a league to go f^u^ther, 

whpn. 



( «79 1 

when, as we went, our ears were falutcd with their 
tnoft unwelcome howlings, cxped^iag every moment 
another attack. But, in ar^ hoar's time, we arrived 
iafc at the town where we were to lodge; and here wc 
found the place ihictly guarded, ana all in terrible 
confufion, as well thoy might, by rcalbn of the bears 
and wolves breaking into the village, iii order to prey 
upon their cattle and people, 'fhc next morning 
we were obliged to take a new guide, by rcafon the 
other fell very bad of his wounds, which he had re- 
ceived, as before-mentioned. After we had reached 
Tbouloufe, we came into a warm, plcafant, and fruit- 
ful country, not infcftcd with wolves, nor any fort 
of ravenous creatures : And when we told our (lory 
there, they much blamed our guide, for conducting 
us through the foreft at the foot of the mountains, 
and in fuch a fevare feafon, when the fnow obliged 
€he|n to feek for fheltcr in the woods. When we 
inforn>ed them in what manner we placed ourfelves, 
and the horfes in the centre, then they exceedingly 
roprchcnded us, and lold us, it was an hundred to 
one but we had all been deilroyed ; for th.it it was 
the fight of the horfes, their fo much defired prey, 
made the wolves more ragingly furious than they 
would have been ; which was evident, by their being 
at other times really afraid of a gun ; but then, be- 
ing exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account, 
their eagernefs to come at the horfes made them in- 
fcnfiblc of their danger ; and that if we had not by 
a continual fire, and at laft, by the cunning ftrata- 
gem of the train of powder, got the power over them, 
it had been 'great odds if their number had not over- 
powered us : Bcfides, it was a great mercy wo alighted 
from our horfes, . and fought them With that courage 
and condudt, which, had wc failed to do, every man 
of us, with our beads, had been devoured. And in- 
deed this was nothing but truth j for, never in my 
life was I fo fenfible of dangler, as when 300 devils 
«ame xo viug upon us s to fiiun whofe unwelcome 

company^ 



C »8o ] 
company, if I was fiirc to meet a ftorm every "week, I 
woold rather go a thoufand leagues by fea. 

I think I have nothing uncommon in my pailagl^ 
through France to take notice of, fince other travellers 
of greater learning and ingenuity, have given a more 
ample account, than my pen is able to fet forth. 
From Thouhufe I travelled to Paris^ from thence to 
Calais^ where I rook (hipping, and landed at Dover 
the 14th of Januarv^ in a very cold feafon. 

Thus came to th^ centre of my travels, I foon dif- 
covered my new-found eftate, and all the bills of ex- 
change I had brought were currently paid. The good 
ancient widow, my only Privy-Counfellor, thought 
no pains or care too great to procure my advantage; 
nor had I ever occalion to blame her fidelity, which 
drew from me an. ample reward* I was for leaving 
my cffefts in her hands, intending to fet out for Lif- 
ien^ and fo to the Brajih ; l>ut as in the dc^folafie Ifland 
I had fome doubts about the Romifii religion, fo I 
knew there was little encouragement to fettle there, 
without I would apofbtize from the orthodox faith, 
or live in continual fear of the inquifition. Upon thi» 
account I refolved to fell my plantation, and to this 
intent I wrote to my old friend at Lijbon^ who return- 
ed me an anfwer, to my great fatisfa^on, which was, 
that he could readily fell it there : However, if Ithought 
it convenient to give him liberty to ofFer it in my 
name to the two merchants, the furvivors of my 
truftces, reficling at the Brajils^ who confequently un- 
dcrftood its intrinfic value, having liv<*d juft upon the 
fpot, and who i was fenfible were very rich, and there- 
fore might be the more willing to purchafe it ; he did 
not in the Icaft doubt, but I (hould make 4 or 5000 
pieces of eight more of it, than I fhould do if I dif- 
pofed of it any other manner whatfoever. 

You may be fure I could not but agree with this 
kind and ingenuous propofal ; and immediately I fent 
him an order to offer it unto them, which he accord- 
ingly did : So that about eight months after, the ihip 

being 



C i8i 1 
in that time returned, he ^ve me a fatisfaAory ac« 
. count that they not only willingly accepted the ofFer, 
but that they nad alfo remitted tnirty-three thoufand 
pieces of eight, to a corrcfpondent of their own at 
Lifioriy in order to pay for its purchafc. 
. Hereupon, in return, I figned the inftrument of 
faJe, according to form, which they had fent from 
Lifiorty and returned it again to my old friend, he 
having fent me, for my cftate, bills of three hundred 
twenty-^ight thoufana pieces of eight, referving the 

rayment of one hundred moidores per ammniy which 
had allowed him during life, as alfo fifty to his fonf 
during life, according to my faithful promifc, which 
the plantation was to make good as rent-charge. 

And thus having led my reader to the knowledge 
of the firft part of my life, fo remarkable for the many 
peculiar providences that attended it, -floating in an 
ocean of uncertainty and difappointment, of advcrfity 
and profperity, beginning foolifhly, and yet ending 
happily *, methinks, now I am come to a fafc and 
pleafant haven, 'tis time to caft out my anchor, and, 
laying up my veflcl, bid (for^a while) adieu to fo- 
reign adventures. I had now other concerns to look 
after, the care of my brother's two fons, which, with 
the good widow's perfuafions, obliged me to continue 
at "home feven years. One of thefe children I bred 
up a gentleman, and the other an experienced failor, 
remarkable for his. courage and bravery. Befide^ 
this I married a virtuous young gentlewoman, 6( a 
very good family, by whom I had two fons and one 
daughter. But my dear and tender wife leaving this 
earthly ftage (as you. will bear in the fecond part of 
my lile, which rending my foul as it it were afundcr, 
my native country became as it were tirefomc to me : 
And my nephew happening to come from fea, tempted 
me to venture another voyage to the Eaji- Indies^ 
which I did in the year 1694, at which time I vifitcd 
my ifland, and informed myfelf of ^w^ry thing that 
bappea^ iince my departure.

One might reafonably imagine, that what I had fuf- 
fered, together with an advanced age^ auid the fear 
of lofine; not only what I had gotten, but my life al- 
io, might have choaked up all the feeds of youthful 
ambition and curiofity, and put a lafting period to 
my wandering inclinations. But, at nothing but death 
can fully allay the adlive part of my life, no lefs re- 
markable for the many various contingencies of it: 
You will there perceive how, I vifited my little king- 
• dom, faw my fucceflfors the Spaniards^ had an account 
of the ufage they met with from the Englijhmen^

at laft they were fubje£ted to the Spaniards^ who yet 
ufed them very honourably; together with the won- 
derful and fuccefsful battles over the Indi^ms^ who 
invaded, and thought to have conquered the ifland, 
but were repelled by their invincible courage and 
bravery, having taken eleven men and five women pri- 
foners j by which, at my return, I found about twen- 
ty young children on my little kingdom. Here I ftayed 
twenty days, left them fupplies of all neceflary things,

FARTHER ADVENTURES 

o r 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Pflj^rein are contained feveral Jlraiigi and furpriftng 
accounts of bis travels^ and mojl remarkabli tranf- 
actions ^ both by fea and land, 

WH E N we confidcr the puiflant force of 
nature, and what mighty influence it has 
many times over the temper of the mind ; 
it will be no fuch great wonder to think 
that my powerful reafon fhould be overcome by a 
much ftrongcr inclination. My late acquired king- 
dom ran continually in my thoughts all the day, and 
I dreamt of it in the night ; nay, I made it the conti- 
nual fubjcA of my talk, even to impertinence, when 
I was awake. I had fuch vapours in my head, that 
I aftually fuppofed rtiyfelf at my caftlc : That I not 
only perctived Friday* s farther, the old Spaniard^ and 
the wicked failors ; but that I talked and difcourfed 
with them about their manner of living : That I 
heard thofe things related to me, which I found af- 
P 2 tcrwatds

terwards to be but too true ; and that I executed my 
judgments with the greateft feverity tipon the offenders. 
And indeed this anticipating all the pleafing joys of 
my life, fcarceiy afforded me otie pleafant hour ; my 
dear and tender wife could nqt but take notice of it, 
which drew thefe affectionate fpecches from her : 
My deoTy (aid ihe, / am really per Juaied that fome fecret 
impulje from heaven eccajipns^ in you a determination to 
fee tot tfiand again :* Nor am I lefs fenfihle^ but your 
being engaged to me and thefe dear children^ is the only 
Aindrance of your departure. I knoWy my dear^ if I 
was in the grave ^ you would not long continue at home: 
Prevent not your happinefe upon my account^ ivhofe only 
contort centers in you. All that I can objeSi isy that 
fiuD an hazardous undertaking is no way conjyient with 
a perfon of your years -y but if you are rejohued to gOy 
(added (he weeping) only permit me to bear you company ^ 
and that is all that I deftre. 

Such endearing tendernefs, graced with the mod 
innocent, and yet moft powerful charms^ brought me 
infenfibly into my right underlianding : And when I 
confidered all the tranfa6lions of my life, and parti- 
cularly my new engagement 5 that I had now one 
child-alreadj born, and my wife big of another \ and 
that I had no occafion to feek for more riches, who 
already was bleffed with fufficiency ; with much ftrug- 
gling, I altered my refolutions at laft, refolviug Xp ap- 
ply myfclf to fome bufinefs or other, which might put 
a period to fuch wandermg inclinations. Hereiipon I 
bought a little farm in the county of Bedford^ with a 
refolution to move thither : Upon this there was a 
pretty convenient houfe, furrounded with land, very 
capable of improvement, which fuitcd my temper, 
as to planting, managing, and cultivating. Nor was I 
long before I entered upon my new fettlcment, having 
bought ploughs, harrows, cart, waggon, horfcs, 
cows and fhcep ; fo that I now led the life of a country 
jgcntleman, and was as happy in my retirement as the ^ 

greareft 



grcatcft monarch in the world. And what made me 
think my happinefs the greater was, that I was in 
that middle ftate of life which my father had fo often 
recommended, much refembling the felicity of a 
rural retirement, which is elegantly defcrihcd by the 
poet in thefe lines. 

Free from all vsces^ free from carey 

Age has no pain^ ana youth nofitare. 
But in the midft of this my chiefcft happinefs, I 
was fuddenly plunged into the grcateft forrow that I 
could poffibly endure : For, when I leaft expeAed it, 
my dear and tender wife was forced to fubmit to the 
irrefiftible power of death, leaving this tranfitory life 
for a better. It is impoiliUe for me to exprcls the 
beauties of her mind, or the lovelinefs of her pcrfon ; 
neither can I too much lament her lofs, which my 
lateft breath (hall record. Her influence was greater 
over me than the powers of my own reafon, the im- 
portunities of friends,, the inilruAions of a father, or 
the melting tears .of a tender and difconfolate mother : 
In a woro^flie was the flandard of all my affairs, the 
center 6f my enterprizes, and the principal engine 
to dircft me in the courfe to happinefs, But now, 
lincc the cruel hand of death had clofed my dcarcft's 
eyes, in my thoughts I feemcd a ftrangcr to the world ; 
my Privy-Gounfellor being* gone, f was like a fhip 
without a pilot, and that could only run before the 
wind. And when I looked around me in this bufy 
world, one part labouring for bread, and the other 
fquandering away their eftatcs ; this put me in mind 
how I had lived in my little kingdom, where both 
reafon and religion diftated to me,, that there was 
fomething that certainly was the reafon and end of 
life, which was far fupcrior to what could be hoped 
for on this fide the grave. My country delights wcrfe 
now as infipid and dull as mufic or fenfe to'thofe who 
have neither tafle or ingenuity. In fhort, refolving 
to leave off houfe-keepingy I left my farm, and in a 
few months returned to London, But 

P 3

[ 186 ] 

But neither could that great city, fo famous for it9 
variety of entertainments, afford me any agreeable 
delight. A ftate of idlenefs I found to be the very 
dregs of life, and moft hurtful to body and foul. It 
vras now the beginning- of the year 1693, at which: 
time my nephew Twho I before obferved had been 
brought up to the lea, and advanced to be captain of 
a fibip) was returned from a fhort voyage to Bilboa^ 
ttie fatt he had made in that ftation. He comes to me 
one morning, telling me, that fome merchants of his 
acquaintance had propofed to him to go a voyage for 
them to the Eafl Indies and China^ in the manner of 
private traders : And now, Unckj faid he. If you'll 
accompany me^ thither^ Fll engage to land you upon your 
fdd ijiandythere to behold thejlate of your little kingdom. 

It was juft before he came in, my thoughts were 
fixed to get a patent for its poffeiTion, and then to fill 
it with inhabitants. After I had paufed a little while, 
and looked fteadfaftly on him. What devil, orjpirit^ 
faid I, fmt you with this unlucky errand P He ftartled 
at firft, but recovering himfelf, when he perceived I 
was not offended : Sir, replied he, what I have pro- 
pofed cannot, I hope, be ftiled unlu cky, fince cer- 
tainly you muft be defirous to fee your little territory, 
where you reigned with more content than any of your 
l>rother Kings in the univerie. Nephew, faid I, if 
you will leave me there, and call for me as you come 
back, I care not if I give my confent : But he an- 
fwered, that the merchants would not allow their vef- 
fcl, laden with an infinite value, to return there again, 
which was a month's fail out of the way : Befides, 
iSir, faid he, fuppofing I fhould mifcarry, was your re- 
queft granted, why then you would be in the fame 
liate as before. This indeed carded a great deal of 
lealbn in it, but we found out a remedy, and that 
was, to carry a framed (loop on board, ready to be 
jfet up in the ifland, by the afliftance of fome carpen- 
ters which we fhould carry v/ith us, that would be 

fitted 



t 187 1 

fitted in a few days to go to Tea. I was not long form- 
ing my refolution, which ovcrfwaycd my (good friend 
the widow's perfuafions, and the naturalafi'edion I 
. fiiouid beai* to my young children. I made my will, 
and fettled my eitate in uich a manner, that I was per- 
fectly eafy that the poor infants would have juilice 
done them. The good widow not only undertook to 
make provifion for my voyage, but alfo took the charge 
of my domeftic affairs, and to provide for my children's 
education ; and indeed no mother coulu take more 
care, or underilood that office better, which I lived to 
reward, and to return her my hearty thanks for. 

The beginning of January 1694-5, my nephew 
being ready to fail, I ajid Friday went on l>oard in the 
Downs on the 8th ^ having, befidcs that floop already 
ihentioned, a very confiderablc cargo for my new co* 
lony. Firjij I had fome fervants, whom I propofcd to 
leave there as inhabitants, or to work while I Aayed 
there, as they fhould appear willing : There were two 
carpenters, a fmith, and a very ingenious fellow who 
was Jack of all trades \ for he was not only a coo|ier 
by trade, but was alfo dexterous at making wlicclv 
and hand-mills to grind corn, likewife a good turner 
«nd a good pot-maker. I alfo carried a taylor, who 
confented to ftay in my plantation, and proved amoft 
neceflary fellow in the ifland. As to my careo, it 
confifted of a fufficient quantity of linen, and hfiglifl) 
ftufFs, for cloathing the Spaniards that I expe£U*a to 
find thqre ; as likewife gloves, hats, ihocs, (lockings i 
together with beds, bedding, and houfhold-ftufF, 
efpecially kitchen utcnfils, with pots, k^^Ues, pewter, 
brafs, &;c. alfo nails, toolsof all forts, flaples, hooks, 
hinges, and all other things neceiTary ^ all v^hich, I 
think, coft me about 300/. Nor was this all, for I 
carried an hundred fparc arms, mufkets, and fuzees, 
befides ibme p idols, a confiderable quantity of feveral 
forts of fhot, two brafs caimon, befides fwords, cut- 
laiTes, and the iron pau for fgmc pikes and halbects j

and I made my iiq)hew take with us tw^ fmall quar* 
tcr-deck guns more than he had occaftoii for in his 
fhip, to leave behind, if there was a neceflity: fo 
^at we might build a fort there, and man it againft 
all oppofers whatfoever. 

Well, we put out to fea ; and though I can't fay 
this voyage was fo unprofperous as my others had 
been, yet contrary winds drove us fo far northward, 
that we were obliged to put in at Galway in Irelandy 
where we Jay wind-bound two and twenty daySr 
Here indeed our provi/ions were very cheap, and wc 
added to our fhip's ftores, by taking in feveral live 
hogs, two cows and calves, which I then refolved ta 
put on fhore in my ifland, if our neceHities did not 
call for them. On the ^th oi February we failed from 
Ireland^ wjth a very fair gale, which lailed for feme 
dajTS ; auid, I think it was about the 20th. of the fame 
month, late in the evening, when the mate informed 
us, that he faw a ilafh of fire, and heard a gun fired ; 
and while h« was fpeaking, a boy came in, and told 
us the boatfwain heard another. Upon which, we all 
ran to the quarter-deck, from w:hence, in a few mi- 
nutes, we perceived a terrible fire at a diflance. We 
had immediate recourfe to our reckonings, in which wi 
were all of opinion that there could be no land that 
way, it appearing to be at N. N. JV, Hereupon we 
concluded that fome fhip had taken fire at fea, and 
thak it could not be far off, by the report of the guns 
which we had heard. We made up direftly to it, and 
in half an hour's time, the wind being feir, we could 
plainly! perceive a' great fliip on fire in the middle of 
the fea. Touched with this unhappy difafter, and 
confidering my former circumflances, when -the P^r- 
iuguefe captaih took me up, I immediately ordered 
five guns to be fired, that the poor creatures (not fee- 
ing us, it beine dark, is we could perceive their flame] 
might be fenfible there was a deliverance - at hand, 
and confequcntly might endeavour tg fare themfelves 

in 



( i89 ) 
"hi their boat. Nor was it Icmg before the (hip blew 
up in the air, and the fire extinguifhed in the ocean. 
But fuppbfing them all to be in their boats, we huns; 
out all our lanthorns, and kept firing till eight o'clock 
in the morning ; when, with our profpedives, we be- 
held two boats, full of people, makine towards us, 
though the tide was agamft them. Then fpreading 
out our antient, and hanging out a waft as a n^nal for 
them to come on board, in half an hour's time we 
came up to them, and took them all in, there being 
nolcfs than 64 men, women and children. It was a 
French merchant (hip of 300 tons, homeward bound 
from ^ebec in the river of Canada. The mafter in- 
formed me, how by the negligence of the fteerfman, 
the fteerage vras let on fire ; that at his outcry for 
help, the fire wias, as they thought, totall/" extin- 
guifhed I but that fome fparks getting between the 
timber and between the cieling, it proceeded into the 
hold, where there was no refilling it ; that then they 
got into their boats, as creatures in the lad extremity, 
with what provifion they had, together with oars, fails, 
and a compafs, intending to go back to Newfoundland^ 
the wind blowing at S. E. and bv E. tho* there were 
feveral chances againft them, as icorms to overfet and 
founder them, rains and colds to benumb and perifh 
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them out 
and ftarve them : But, faid he, in this our great dif- 
trcfs, we heard the wclgome report of your guns, 
when, withninfpeakable joy, taking down our muftd 
and fails, we were refolved to lie by till morning ; but 
perceiving your light, we fet ouf oars at work to keep 
our boat a- head, the fooner to attain your Ihip, the 
happy inftrument of our deliverance. 

Indeed no one can exprefs the joy of thcfe poor crea- 
tures on this occafion : Fear and grief are eafily fet 
forth : Sighs and tears, with a few motions of the 
hands and head, make up the fum of its variety : 
But an excefs or furprize of joy carries in it a thuu- 

fund 



fand extravagances ; efpecially, I think^ atnongfi the 
French J whofc temper is allowed to be more volatile^ 
paifioiute, fpri^tly and fluids than in other kingdopis*. 
Some were either weepings tearing themfelves in the 
greateft agonies^ of forrow, and running ftark raving 
mad alH>ut the fhip \ while the reft were ftamping with 
their jfeet, wringing their hands, finging, laughing^ 
fwooning away, vomiting, Minting; with a few, re- 
turning hearty thanks to the Almightv, and croffing 
themfelves. I think, if I am not miftaken, our fur- 
geon was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But 
among the pa&ngers there were two priefts, the one 
an old, and the other a young man ; but what amazed 
9fie mote, the oldeft was the worft : For, no fooner 
4id he perceive himfelf freed from danger, but he 
dropped ^down as it were without life, and to ever^ 
one^s appearance, quite dead ; but the furgeon, chaN 
ing and rubbing his arm, he opened a vein^ which 
at firft dropped, and then flowing more freely, the old 
man began to open his eyes, and in a quarter of an 
hour was well again. But foon revolving his happy 
change, the joy of which whirled his fpirits about 
fafter than the veflels could convey them, his blood 
became fo feverifh, as made him more fit for bedlam 
than any other place j but the furgeon giving him a 
flcepy dofe, he was perfeftly compofed next morning* 
Remarkable indeed w^s the behaviour of the young 
prieft. At his entrance on board the (hip, he fell on 
his fecein the moft humble proftration to the Al- 
mighty. I thought indeed he had fallen into a fwoon^ 
and fo ran to help him up ; but he modeftly told me„ 
he was returning his thanks to the Almighty, defiring 
me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to 
his Creator, he would return me thanks alfo. And 
indeed he did fo about three minutes after, with great 
ferioufnefs and afFeftion, though the tears ftood in his 
eyes, which confirmed the gratitude of his foul. Nor 
did helels fliew his piety and wifdom, in applying 

himfelf 



[ »9I 3 
Bimfelf to his country people, and labouring to com- 
poTe them by the moft powerful reafons, arguments, 
and perfuaflons. And when, indeed thefe people had 
taken their night's repofe, in fijch convenient lodg- 
ings as our fhip would allow, we found nothing but 
the beft of manners, and the moft civil acknowledg- 
ments, for which the French are eminently rcniarkable. 
The next day the captain and one of the pricfts, dc- 
fircd to fpesuc with me and my nephew the com- 
mander. They told us, that they had faved fome 
money and valuable things out of the ruined veflel, 
which was at our fervice, only that they dcfired to be 
fet on fhore fome where in our way. At the firft, 
my nephew was for accepting the money j but I, (who 
knew how hard my cafe would have been, had the 
Portuguize captain fervcd me fo) perfuaded him to the 
contrary ; and therefore told them, that as we had 
done nothing but what we were obliged to do by rca- 
fon and humanity, and what we ourfclves misht ex- 
pert from others m fuch calamity ; fo we took tncm up 
to fave them, not to plunder -them, or leave them na- 
ked upon the land, to perifh for want of fubfiftence, 
and therefore would not accept their mojiey : But as 
to landing them, that was a great difficulty ; for being 
bound to the EaJI Indits, it was impoflible wilfully to 
change our voyage upon this particular account, nor 
my nephew (who was under charter-partv to purfue 
it by way of Braftl) anfwcr it to the freignters. All 
that we could do was, to put ourfclves in the way of 
meeting fome ftiips homeward bound from the tVeJI 
Indiesy that if poffible they might get a paflage to France 
or England. Indeed they were very thankful for our 
flrft kindnefs j but were under great concern, efpe- 
cially their paflengers, at their being carried to the Eaji 
Jndies. They begged therefore I would keep on the 
banks of Newfoundland^ where pro'bably they might 
meet with fome (hip or floop to carry them to Canada^ 
whence they came* ^s this was but a reafonable re* 

qucft, 



[ 19a 3 

qUeft, I was inclined to grant it, ilnce it was no breadh 
of charter-party ; aitd that the laws of God and na- 
ture obliged us to do what good we could to our fel- 
low creatures ; and befides, the danger we ourfelves 
ihould be in for want 0/ provifions : So we confented 
to carry them to Newfoundland^ if wind and weather 
would permit ; if not, that we fhould carry them to 
Martinico in the PFeJi Indies. But, as it happened, 
in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland^ 
where the French people hired a bark to carry .them to 
France. But the young prieft being defirous to go to 
the Eejl Indies y I readily agreed to it, becaufe I liked 
his converfation ; and two or three of the French, failors 
alfo entered themfelres on board our {hip. 

Now direfting our courfe for the Weft Indies ^ (leer* 
ing 5. and S. by E. about 20 days with little wind, 
another adventure happened to exercife our humanity. 
In the latitude of 17 degrees 5 m. north, the 19th 
of March 1694-5, we perceived a fail, (our courfe 
S. E. and by S.) which bore up to us, and then (he ap- 
{>eared to.be a large veflel, having loft her main-top- 
maft, fore-ntaft, and bolt-fprit^ when firing a gun, 
as a fignal of diftrefs, wind N. N. W. we foon came 
to fpeak with her. She was a fhip of Bri/iolj bound 
home from Barbadoes^ out of which road ihe bad been 
forced by a hurricane to the weftward, in which they 
loft their mafts : They told us, their expeditions 
were to fee the Bahama Iflands, but were driven away 
by a ftrong v/ind at N. N. IV. and having no fails, 
to work the fliip with, but the main courfe, and a kind 
of fquare fail upon a jury fore-maft, becaufe they 
could not come near the land, were endeavouring to 
ftand for the Canaries. Nay, what was worfe, bclidcs 
all their fatigue, they were almoft ftarved for w^mt of 
provifion, having cat nothing for 1 1 days, all that 
they had a-board was fugar, a cafk of frefli water, 
and feven cafks of rum. In this fliip were three paf- 
fengers \ a youth, his mother, and a fluid fervant, 

whf 



r 193 1 

who were in a moft deplorable condition for want of 
. food. If I had not gone on board their ihtp, this 
knowledge of their mifery had been concealed from 
me, and they would have inevitably periftied, tho' in- 
deed their fecond mate (who was captain, by rcafon 
the true captain was not on board when the hurricane 
happened) had before informed me, that there were 
fuch perfons on board, whom he fuppofed to be dead* 
being afraid to enquire after them, becaufe he had no« 
thing to give them for relief. Hereupon we refolvcd 
to let them have what we could fpare, ordering the 
mate to bring fome of his men on: board us, which 
he did accordingly, yet b#th he and they looked like 
(keletons ; and when meat was fct before them, I 
ordered them to cat Iparingly. Btit, hovvcvcis they foon 
fell fick, which obliged the furgeon to mix fomethinc 
in their broth, that was to be to them both food and 
ph) lie. .When they were fed, we ordered our mate 
to carry them a fack of bread, and four or five pieces 
of beef to boil ; but the furgeon charged them to fee 
it boiled, and to keep 41 guard in the cook-room, to 
prevent the men eating it rau', and confcquently kill 
thcmfelycs with what v/as deligncd for their relief. 
But particularly I defircd the mate to fee whit con- 
dition the poor paflingcrs were in, and the Turgcoii 
gave him a pitcher of the fame broth which he had 
prepared for the men : Atid being curious to fee this 
fcene of mifery myfelf, 1 took the captain, (as wfe 
called the mate of the (hip) in our^Avn boat, and 
failed after them. 

Here was a fad fioht indeed ! Scarce was the vic- 
tuals' half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to 
break open the cook-room door. To ftay tlieir ilo- 
machs, the mate gave them bifcuits, which were dipt 
in, and foftencd with the liquor of the meat, which 
they call Brewls; telling them it was for their own 
•iVifety, that he was obliged to give them but a little 
at a time ^ uid fo i^cding them gradually; their bdlies 
#. Q. were 



were cdmfortabljr filled, and. the men did very. wtH 
again. But when they came to the poor' gentlewo- 
man in the cabin, who for fevcral days continued with- 
out food, giving what fhe had to her fon, they found 
her as it were in the arms of deadi. She was fitting 
upon the floor of the decif, with her back up againft 
the fides, between two chairs, which were lafhed faft, 
and her he^d fhrunk between her {houldcrs, like a 
fenfelcfs dorps. Nothing was wanting in my mate to 
revive and encourage her, opening her lips, a^id put- 
ting fome broth into her mouth with a.fpoon. BuJ 
not having ftrength to fpcak, fhe lifted up her head 
with much difficulty, intimating that it was now tod 
late ;'at the fame time pointing to the youth, her fon, 
as though 'flie defired him, to do what he could to 
fave him ; and, in a little time after, flie died. 

The youth indeed was not fo far gone ; yet lay 
Wretched out in a cabin bed like one that had fcarc€ 
any life : In his mouth was a piece of an old glovci 
the reff of which he had eat up. At.firft he vomited 
up what the mate had given him ; but at length be- 
, gan fenfibly to revive, though in the greateft concern 
for the death of his tender mother. 

As to the poor maid fhe lay by her miftrcfslike one 
in the latefl pangs of death : Her limbs were dif- 
torted, one of her hands was clafpcd round the frame 
of a chair, which fhe griped fo hard, that it was with 
fome difficulty wc feparated her from it -, her other 
arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together, 
fet faft againfl the frame of the cabin table j not only 
being ihifVcd with hunger, but overcome with grief 
for the lofs of her miitrcfs, whom fhe lov'Cd moll 
tenderly. ' Jt was a great while before the furgeon 
could bring her to life, and a much longer time before 
Ihe camV'to her fcMiies. 

After' we had failed with them fome days, wc fent 
them five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogf- 
heads of bifcuit, with peafe, flour, and other things, 

taking 



[ T95 ] 

taking three caflcs of fugar, fomc rum, nnJ fonic 
pieces of eight for fatisfufti^on, wc left them, but i<x»k 
the youth and maid with us, with all their goovi>. 
The lad was about 17 years oKl, vci-y hanJlome, mo- 
dett, fcnfiblc, and well bred, but mightily conccriud 
for the lofs of his honoured mothtM", havmg loft his 
father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He be- 
feechcd the furgeon to intercede with mc to t;ike him 
out of the fhip j for that t!ie failor-, not fparini^ a 
fmall fullcnancc, . had murdered his moth».r. iiut 
hunger has no bounds, no right, and conlequcntly is 
incapable of any companion. When the furgeon told 
him that our voyage might put hi.n in bad circum- 
ftances, and farther fro:n his friend.*, he anfwered, he 
did not care fo hcwas butdtlivcrcd fromjhi;t terrible

became of her afterwards. We were now in the la- 
titude of j 9 deg. 32 rtiin, having" as yet a tolerable 
good vQyagc^ But, pafiing by feveral little incidents 
relative to wind and weather, I (hall relate what is 
more remarkable concerning my little kingdom, which 
I was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in 
attaining it; for as I came, to, and went from it be- 
fore, on the fouth artJ caft of the ifland, aS coming 
from the Braftls\ fo now approaching between the 
main and the illand,'not havingany chart of the coaft, 
nor land-mark, it obliged ustog9 on. Ihorc feveral 
C£2 * iflands, 



t 196 } 

iflands, on the mouth of the great river Oromoio^ but 
t6 no purpofe. Then I perceived, that \jrhat I thought 
was a continent before, was no fuch thing, but along 
ifland, or rather a rid^c; of fand. On one of thefe 
iflands, I found fome Spaniards^ but they belonged to ' 
the Ifle de TrinUa/iy who came hither in a floop to 
make fait, and find fomC pearl mufclcs, if they could. 
But at length I came fair on the fouth fide of my 
ifland, and then I prcfently knew the countenance of 
my little kingdom ; fo we brought the fhip fafe to an 
anchor, with her broadfide to the little creek, where 
ftoDd my antient and venerable caftle. 

No fooncr did I fee the place, but calling for Friday^ 
I afked him where he was ? But when he looked a lit- 
tle, he clapped his hands, crying, O joy^ JD there^ 
yiSy O there/ pointing to our old abode, and then fell 
a dancing and capering as if he was mad y and I had 
nHich ado to keep him from jumping into the fea, to 
fwim aftiorc. Friday ^ faid I, what do you think, ihall 
iive fee yom father ? At the mmitioning his father's 
name, the poor afFe£lf»nate creature fdl a weeping : 
No no (fays he) rne fee him no more^ never fee poor fa- 
tlkr more ! he long ago die^ die long ago -^ be much old 
yiaii. You don't know that Friday j^fdd I, but fliall 
we fee any body el fe ? He looks about, and pointing 
to the hill above my houfe, hec^fes out, JVe fee ! we 
fee I there mud) men^. and there f which, tho* I could 
not perceive them with my pa-fpc<5live glafs, was 
true, by what the men themfelves tgld me the next 
day. 

When the Englijh Ancient was fpread, and three 
guns fired as a fignal of friendfhip,' we perceived a 
fmoke rife from the creek ; upon which I ordered the 
boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a 
white flag of truce, 1 went on fliore, accompanied, 
alfo by the young Friar, to whom I had related the 
hiflory of the firjft part of my life. Befides, we had 
fixreen men well armed, in cafe we had met with any 
oppofition. After^

[ '97 1 

After we had rowed dircftly into the creek, the firft 
man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard^ whofc 
life I had favca, and whofc face \ perfectly well 
knew. I ordered them all to ftav in the boat for a 
while ; but /r/^/ perceiving his father ^it a diflancc, 
would have jumped into the fca had they not let him 
ro. No fooncr was he on fliorv\ but he flow like a 
wift arrow out of a bow, to embrace liis ancient fa^ 
thcr. . Certainly it would melt a man "of the firmt-ft^ 
re olutton," into the fofteft tears, to fee with what* 
uncommon tranfports of joy he faluted him. He firll 
kfT d him, then ftrokcd his face, took him in his 
arms, laid him under a (hady tree, fat down by him, 
then looked as earncft at him as one would do at a 
pifture, for a quarter of an hour together. After this 
he would lie upon the ground, ftroke his legs, and 
kifs them, then get up and (tare at him as though he 
was bewitched : But the next day one could not for- 
bear laughter, to f :e his behaviour ; for he would walk 
feveral hourawith his father along the Ihore, leading 
him by the hand as though he was a lady, while every 
now and then he would run to the boat to get fomc- 
thingforhim; as a lump of fu gar, dram, bifcuit, 
or fomething or other that was good. His frolics raiv 
in another channel in the afternoon ; for, when he " 
fet old Friday on t*ie ground, he would dance round 
him, making comical poftures and gc{turcs ; and alf 
this while would be telling him one Itory Or other df. 
his travels and adventures. 

It was on tlie loth oi April ^ An#io 1^95, that I fct* 
my foot upon the ifland a fecoud time. When my 
faithful Spaniard^ accompanied by one irouc, ap- " 
pr,)ached the boat. He little knew who I was', till., 
I difcovered myfclf to him : Selgr:ur^ faid T, in Por^ 
tugueze^ dont you know mc ? He fpoke never a v/6rd ; , 
bat, giving his mufket to his attend.snt, extended his 
arms, and faying fomething in Spm/ijh that *! did not ' 
then.undcrftand, he came fonA-ard and embraced mc j . ' 
(^3 • U>in2 



t 198 ] 
faying, he was inextufablc, not to know hrs deliverer, 
who, iikcan angel fcnt from heaven, had ra\ cd his life. 
He then* beckoned to the man to call out his compa- 
nions ; afking me if I would walk to my own habita- 
tion, and take poffeflion, where I fliould find fomc 
naean improvements ; but indeed they were extraor- 
dinary ones ; for they had planted fo many trees, fo 
clofe together, that the place was like a labyrinth, 
which none could find out except themfelves, who 
knew its intricate windings. I alked him the mean- ^ 
ingof all thefe fortifications ; he told me, he would 
give me a large account of what had paft fince my de- 
parture to this time, and how he had fubdued fome 
EngUJh who thought to be their murderers, hoping I 
would not be difpkafed, fince ncccflity compelled them 
to it. As I knew they uere wi^cd villains, I told 
him, that I was not only far from finding fault with 
it, but was rather heartily glad they had fubdued them. 
But while we were talking, the man whom he had 
fent returned, accompanied by eleven more ; but in 
fuch habits, that it was impoffible to tell what nations 
they were of. He firft turned to me^ pointing to 
them ; Thefe, Sir, faid he, are fome of the gentle- . 
men who owe their lives to your goodnefs; and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them 
fenfible who I was : And then indeed they faluted me 
one by one, not as ordinary men, but as though they 
had. been ambafiadors of noblemen, and I a triumphant 
conqueror : For their behaviour not only agreed 
with a manlike, majeftic gravity, but, at the fame 
tune, was fo obliging and courteous, as made them 
adinirable to the laft degree. 

Before I relate thehiftory of the tranfa£Fion« of my 
kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard'^ owji mouth, 
I muft here infert what 1 omitted in my former rela- 
tion. The matter is this : Juft before we weighed 
anchor to fet fail, there happened a quarrel on board 
the fhip, which had like to have occafioncd a fecond 

mutiny, 



[ 199 J 
mutiny, till fuch time as the courageous captain, tak- 
ing two of the mcft rcfri^tory prifoncrs, he laid them 
ill irons, threatening them, as thi y were concerned 
in the former difordcrs, to have them hundred in £n^- 
hmdiox running away with the fl;ip. This fri|^htened 
fomc of the reft, as thinking the captain would fcrvc 
them in the fame manner, tho' he feemed to give them 
good words for the prefcnt. But the mate, having 
intelligence of this, made me acquainted with their 
fears j fo that to make them more cafy, and ourfclves 
more iafe from their confpiracies, I was obliged to go 
down, and pafs my Jlmour^^ word for it, that, upon 
their good behaviour, all that was pad fhould be par- 
doned 5 in teftimony of which, I ordered the two men's 
irons to be taken off, and thcir.iclvcs forgiven. But 
as this had brought us to an anchor thac night, in 
which there was a caim, the two men that had been 
in irons, flole each of them a mufkct, and fome other 
weapons, and taking the fhip's pinnance, not yet 
bawled up, ran away to their brother rogues. 1 he 
next morning we fcnt the lons^ boat, with men to 
purfue them, but all in vain. I'hc mate, in revenge, 
would have demoliflied my little cadle, burnt its fur- 
niture, and deftroyed their plantations ; but having 
no orders for it, he did not put it in execution. And 
thu;s there were five Engltjhnun in the ifland, which 
caiifed great difFerenccs, as my faithful Spaniard gave 
me a perfect account of in the following manner. 

You cannot. Sir, but remember the embafly you 
fent me about, and what a difappointmcnt we met 
with, by your abfence, at our return. There is but 
little variety in the relation of our voyage, being bleft 
with calm weather and a i'mooth fea. Great indeed 
was the joy of my countrymen, on feeing me alive, 
having adted as the principal man on board, the cap- 
tain of the ihip-wreck'd vefl'el dying before ; nor 
was their furprize lefs, who knowing I was taken pri- 
foner by the favages of another nation^ thought me 

long 



[ 200 ] 

long fince entombed i n thcix monftrous bowels. But, 
when I fhewed them the arms, ammunition, and pro- 
vifion I had brought tor them, they looked upon mc 
as 2u fepond Jofiph advanced in PbaraohH Court, and 
immediately -prepared to come alortg with me. In- 
deed, they were obliged to trefpafs upon their friendly 
favages, by borrowing two of their canoes, under a 
pretext for fiftiing; and they came away the next 
morning, but without any provifions of their own, 
exeept a few roots, which ferved them inftead of bread. 
After three week's abfence, we arrived at our habi- 
tation. Here we met with three Englijh failors, who, 
I confcfs, gave us provifions, and that letter of direc- 
tions you had left for us, which informed us, how to 
bring up tame goats, plant corn, cure grapes,, make 
pots J and, in mort, every thing that was neceffary for 
our ike ; as in particular, I knew your method Dcft: 
So taking Friday*^ fiather to affift me, we managed all 
the affairs. Nor were the reij: of the Spaniards waht^ 
irtg in their kind offices, dreffing food for the Evglijh- 
w»«,whodid nothing but ramble and divert themfclvcs 
in the woods, either fliooting parrots, or catching, tor- 
toises. But we had not been long arfhore, before wc 
were informed of two more EngUJhmm^ unnaturally 
turned out of their common place of fefidence, by the 
three others above-mentioned : This made my 5/^- 
niards and me (whom they looked upon as their 
Governor, in your abfence) endeavour to perfuadc 
them to take them in, that we might be as one family \ 
but all our entreaties were in rain ; fo tbat the poor " 
fellows fin?}ing nothing to be dor.c without Ir iiiftry, 
pitched their leiits or the north fulc of the lfl'aid,4i 
little !nc!iRino;.tothf weft, for fear of favages. Here 
they built two hut*, one to lod'^e, and the ether to 
lay tht ir ^i:ores in ; for my good-natured Spaniards 
givin: "i -"m fome f ^d, they dug and planted as I had 
done, and began to live prettily. P ^t while they 
were joing on .thi|$ comfortably, the thitc uii natural 

brutes,, 



[ 201 ] 

brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, 
infultcd them, by faying the Governor (meaning you) 
bad given them poflcfYion of the ifland, and, damn 
them, they fhouly build no houfes u|K)n their ground, 
without paying rent. The two honed mca (for fo 
let nit nowdirtinguifti them) thought their three coun- 
trymen only jerted, and one of them invited them in, 
to fee their nne habitations ; while the other fdo:- 
tioufly told them, tliat fince they built tenements, 
with great improvements, they mould, according to 
the cullom of landlords, give them a longer leafe } at 
the fame time defirinc: them to fetch a fcrivener to 
draw the writings. One of the wretches, fwcaring 
he (hould pay for the jeft, fnatches up a fire-brand, 
and clapping it to the outfide of their hut, very fairlv 
fet it oii nre, which foon would have been confumea, 
had not the honeft man thruft him away, and trod it 
out with his feet. Hereupon the fellow returns with 
a pole, with which he would have ended his days, had 
not the poor man avoided the blow ; when fetching 
his muflcet, he knocked the villain down that began 
the quarrel. The other two, coming to aflift their 
fellow, obliged the other honeft man to take his muf- 
ket alfo, and both, prcfenting their pieces, bid the 
villains ftandofF; and if they did not lay down their 
arms,.death (hould decide the difpute one way or other. 
This brought them to a jjarley, in which they agreed 
to take their wounded man, and be gone ^ but they 
were in the wrong that they did not difarm them when 
they had the power, and then make their complaint 
to me and my Spaniards for juftice, which might have 
prevented their farther defigns againft them. And 
indeed fo many trefpafTes did they commit after, by 
treading down their corn, fhootiiig their youn^; kids 
and goats, and plaguing them night and day, that they 
reiblved to come to my caftle, challenge all the three, 
and decide their right by one plain buttle, while the 
Spctttimds ftood by to fee fair play. Oiic day it hap- 
pened. 



r 2:2 ] 

pencd, that two of mv 5/> zv.wv/j (one of whom un- 
defftood Englijh) being in the woods, were met by 
one of the honeft men, who complained how barba- 
rpus. their countrymen had been, in deftroying their 
corn, killing their jr.ilch-goat and 3 kids, which de- 
prived them of their iubfiftence ; that if we did not 
g^nt the:m relief, tiicy muft be inevitably ftarved ; and 
fo they parted : But when my Spaniards came home 
; at night, and.fuppor being on the table, one of them 
bc^fan to- reprehend iho Engli/hmcn^ but in a very man- 
nerly wav J which they refcnting, replied. What bu- 
fuiel's haa th(?ir countrymen there without leave ? and 
that it was none of their ground. Whv, faid my 
Spaniard calmly, Inglefi they muft not ftarve : But 
they replied, iLct them ftarve and be dandned, they 
fhould neither phnt nor build ; and damn them, they 
Ibotlld be their iervants, and work for them ; for the 
ifjand was tb'irs^ and they would burn all the huts 
they fhould fend on thejtand:.By this rOle (^faid my 
Spaniard (m'lling) we (hall be your fervants too ? Aye, 
by God, ana io you ihall, replied the impudent raf- 
cal. Upon which, Pf^U, Atkins ftarffng up,' cries, 
come,^y^c^^ lei's hive t*other bfufti with them; who 
dare to build in our dominions ? Thus, leaving us 
fomething heated with a- juft pai'iion, away they 
trooped, every man havin:^ a gun, piftol, and fword, 
muttt«ing fome threatening whnis, that we couJd then 
but imperfectly underfland. That^ night they de- 
figned to murder their t;vo companions, and flept till 
midnight in the bower, thinking to f:;ll upon them in 
their fleep : Nor were the honefi men lefs thoughtful 
concerning them ; for at this junfture they were com- 
ing to find them out, but in a much fairer W2ty. As 
foon as the villains came to the huts, and found no- 
body there, they concluded, that I and my Spaniards 
had given them notice, and therefore fwore to be re- 
venged on us. Then they demolifhed the poor men's 
habitation, uot by fire, aa they attempted before, but

ruined asaiorefaid ; and indeed it \f as very hard, that 
nineteen of us fliould be bullied by three villains, 
contiu^iallyoHonding with impunity. 

It was a i^reat while. Sir, before we could perfuadc 
the two En^tajhrnen from purfuing, and undoubtedly 
killing than with their fire-arms, but we promifed 

them 



[ 204 1 
them jufticc fliould be done them, and in the mean 
time they fhould refiJc with us in our own habitation. 
In about five days after, thefe five vagrants, almoft 
•ftarved with hunger, drew near our grove ; and per- 
ceiving me, the Governor, and two others, walking 
by the Tide of the creelc, they vtry fubmiifively de- 
fired to be received into the family again. We XxAi 
them of their great incivility to us, and of their un- 
natural barbarity to their countrymen ; but yet we 
would fee what the reft agreed to, and would bring 
them word in half an hour. After fome derbate, we 
called them iny where their two countrymen laid a 
heavy charge againft them, for not only ruining, but 
defigning to murder them, which they couid not deny. 
But here I was forced to^nterpofe as a mediator ; by 
obliging the two Englijhmen not to hurt them, bcin^ 
naked and unarmed ; and that the other three (houid 
make them rcflitution, by building: their two huts, 
and fencing their ground in the fame manner as it was 
before. Well, being in a miferablc condition, they 
fubmittcd to this at prefent, and lived fome time re- 
gularly enough, except to the working part, which 
thoy did not care for ; but the Spaniards would have 
difpenfed with that, had they continued eafy arid quiet. 
Their arms being given to them again, they fcarce 
hud them a week, till they became as troublefome as 
ever ; but an accident happening foon after, obliged 
,us to lay afidc private refentments, and look to our 
common prefervation. 

One night. Sir, I went to bed perfedUy well in 
health, and yet by no means could 1 compofc myfelf 
to flcep : Upon whicli, being very uneafy, I got up, 
and looked out, but it being dark, could perceive no- 
thing but the trees around our cattle : I went to bed 
again, but it was all one, I could not fleep ; when one 
of my Spaniards hearing me walk about, afked me, 
who is that up ? I anfwered, *tis I j when I told hipi 
the occafion j Sir faid he, fuch things are not to be 

flighted i 



[ 205 ] 
flighted J for certainly there is fome mifchief plotting 
near us. Where arc the EngllJInnen ? faid I. He au- 
fwered, in their huts : for they lay feparate from us. 
Sir, fincc the Jaft mutiny. Well, faid I, fome kind 
fpirit gives this information for our advantage. Come, 
let us look abroad, and fomething may offer to judifvr 
our pains. Upon which I and fome ot my Spaniards 
went up to the mountain, not bv the ladder, but thru' 
the grove j and then we were (truck into a panic fear 
by feeing a light, as though it were a lire, at a very 
little diftancc, and hearing the voices of feveral men. 
Hereupon we retreated immediately, and raifmg the 
refl of our forces, made them fenfible of the impending 
danger : But, with all my authority, I could notpiake 
thcnl ftay where they were, fo carnoft were they to 
fee how things went j though indeed the darknefs of 
the night gave them opportunity enough to view thcrn 
(by the light of the iire) undifcovcred. As thcy^ wcie 
different parties, and ftraggling over the (hore, uc 
were much afraid that they ihould find eut our habi- 
tation, and deftroy our flocks of goats : To prevtift 
which, we fent one Englijhmany and two Spaniards y t(» 
drive the goats into the valley where the cave lay ; or, 
. if there was ocpafion, into the cave itfclf. As to oui 
own parts, refumingour native courage and prudciii; 
conduct, had they not been divided, we durft venture 
to d?ttack an hundred of them. But, before it was yc-e 
light, we refolved to fend out Friday's father as a fpy ; 
who, immediately firripping himfelf naked, gets among 
them undifcovcred, and in tv^o hour's time, brings 
word, that they were two parties, of two tiiftcrcnt 
nations, who, having lately a bloody battle with one 
another, happened to land by mere chance on the 
fame ifland, to devour their miferable prifoncrs ; that 
they were entirely ignorant of any pcrfon's inhabiting 
here j but rather, oeing filled with rage and fury 
againft one another, he believed, that as foon as day- 
light appeared, there would be a terrible engagement. 

R Old 



r 206 I 

Old Fridtvj had fcarce ended his relation, but we heard ' 
ail uncommon noife, and perceived that there was an 
horrid engagement between the two armies. 

Such was the curio(i|y of our party, efpecially the 
Engliflrnietty that they would not lie clofe, though Old- 
Friday told them their fafety depended upon it ; and 
that, if we had patience, we fhouid -behold the favages 
kill one another. However, they ufed fi>me caution, 
by going further into the woods, and placed them- 
fedves in a convenient place to behold the battle. 

Never could be a more bloody engagement, nor 
men of more invincible fpirits and prudent conduct, 
according to their way and manner of fighting. It 
lafted near two hours, till that party which was neareft 
our caftle began to decline, and at laft to fly from 
their conquerors. We were undoubtedly. Sir, put 
into a great confternation on this account, left they 
ihould run into our grove, and, confequently, bring 
us into the like danger. Hereupon we refolyed to 
kill the firft that came, to prevent difcovcry ; and 
that too with our fwords, and the b^t-cnd of our 
mufk^ts, for fear the report of our guns fliould be 
heard. 

And fo indeed it happened as we thought ; for three 
of the vanquifticd army crofling the creclc, ran di- 
TtiWy to the place, as to a thick wood for (belter ; nor 
was it long before our fcout- gave us notice of it ; as 
alfo, that the vi<5lors did not think it fit to purfu« 
them. Upon this, I would not fuftcr them to be (lain, 
but had them furprifcd and taken by our party ; and 
afterwards they proved very good fervants to us, being 
ftout young creatures, and able to do a great deal of 
work. The remainder of the conquered lavages, 
fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean ; 
while the conquerors, joining together, fhouted by 
way of triumph ; and about three in the afternoon, they 
alfo embarked for their own nation. Thus we were 
freed at once, from the f^^agcs and our fears, not- 
perceiving 



[ 207 1 
perceiving smy of thcfc cii-;i(iin*s for fomc c<inruicrab1r 
time after. Wc found uvo aiui thirty nwii ilea J in 
the (ickl of battle ; fome were flain with lon^; arr(»ws, 
which wc found ftickiag in their bodies ; ;in<l the rcil 
were killed with laro;e ujiwieldy wof»dcn fwords, which 
denoted their vaft urength ; and of which wc found 
feventeen, befidcs bows and arrows : But we could 
2U)t find one wounded creature among ttiein alive ; 
for they either kill-their enemies quite, or carry thofc 
wounded away with them. 

This terrible fight tamed the Eri^^Ufnmcn for fomc 
time J coufidering how unfortunate they might have 
Ixxrn, had they fallen into their hands, who w('uld not 
only kill them a^ enemies, but alio for food, as we 
do cattle: And. indeed, fo much did this naufcate 
their ftomachs^ that it not only made them very fick, 
but more tractable to the common neccffary bvifincfs 
of the whole focicty, planting, fowing, ard reaping^ 
with the greateft ngns of amity and friendihip : So 
that now, being all good friends, wc bcp^an to confidt-r 
bf circumftances in general ^ and the firft thing wc 
thought of was, Whether, as we perceived tin: fa- 
vages haunted that fide of the ifland, and there being 
more retired parts of it, and yet as well fuitcd to our 
manner of living, and equally to our advantage, wc 
ought not much rather to move our place of rcddence, 
and plant it in a much fafer place, both for the fccu- 
rity of our corn anu cattle ? 

After a long debate on this head, it was rcfolved, 
or rather voted, mmine cofttradiccntey not to remove: 
our ancient caftlc j and that for this very good rc;i- 
fon, that fome time or other we cxpefted to hear 
from our fupremeCiovernor (meaning you., Sir) v.hoCt! 
mcflcngers, not finding us there, might thinlc the 
place demolished, and all his fubjc(^s dcAroyed by 
t'le favages. 

As to the next concern, relating to our corn and 

cattle, wc confcnted to have them removed to the val- 

R I kj 



[ 208 ] 
ley where the cave was, the land there being propereft, 
and fufficient for both. But yet, when vre coniidered 
further, we altered one part of our refoiution, which 
was, to remove part of our cattle thither, and there 
plant only part of our corn ; fo that in cafe one part 
was deftroycd, the other might be preicrved. We 
took another refoiution, which really had a great deal 
of prudence in it, and that was, in not trufting the 
three favages, which we had taken prifbncrs, with 
any knowledge of the plantation we had made in that 
vailey, or of what number of cattle, much lefs the 
cave, wherein we conveyed feveral arms, and two 
barrels of ( o ^rder you lefc for us, at your departure 
from this ifiand. But though we could not change 
our habitation, we refolved to make it more fortified 
and more (ccret. To this end. Sir, as you had planted 
trees at fome diilance before the entrance of your 
palace, fo we, imitating your example, planted and 
ftlled up the whole fpace of ground, even to the 
banks of the creek, nay, into the very ouze where 
the tide flowed, not leaving a place for landins: 
And among thofe you had planted, we alfo intermingKd 
fo many fhort ones, all of which growing wonder- ' 
fully fail and thick, fcarcely a little dog could find a 
pafiage through them. Nor was this fufficient, as we 
thought, for we did die fame to all the ground, to the 
right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill, 
without fo much as a paflage for ourfelves, except 
by the ladder ; which being taken down, nothing 
but what had wings or witchcraft could pretend to 
come near us. And indeed this was excellently well 
contrived, cfpccially to ftrve that occafion, for which 
we afterwards found it ncccflary. 

Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, 
not having one vifit from the favages all that time. 
Indeed one morring we had an alarm, which put us 
into fome amazement j for a few of my Spaniards be- 
ing out very early, |>erceived no lefs than twenty c^-

noes, as itirere, coiring on (hore; !ip/>n whitli, ir 
turning bocnevrich grrar prccipiuti(»ii, thry {'.avr iim 
the alarm, which obliged us t-% keep at home all \hv 
day, and the next, goin^ out only in the niyht timr 
to make oar obfenat ions : But, as [[nnd hick would 
have it, they wrre upon another delign, and dirl if it 
land that time upon the ifl.ind. 

But now there happened another ()(inirr] bvtw t a 
the three wicked Engiijhmertj and fnme of iny Sjui • 
ftlards. The occafion was this : On*: of them heiiij* 
enraged atone of the fjvagc«, whom we h.id t.ikni 
prifoner, fo^ not being able to coniptcSeinl fointthin'r 
which he was (hewing him, he fiiatches tip u halt hci 
in a great fury, not to corre6t, but to kill liim \ l>iit 
miffinj his head, he gave h!ni fiuh a harh.ironH cut in 
his (houlder, that had like to have flriuk oiDiis arm ; 
at which, one of my gooJ-naturcd Spttnltnds^ intrrpoi- 
jng between the Englijhman and the poor fav:\;^e, he- 
(eeched the former not to niurtliTthe noor creature : 
But this kindnefs haJ like to coif the SpuNiftfii'y, life j 
for the Englififnan llruck at him in the fame nianiUT, 
which he nimbly and fuddenly avoidin«;^, rcturiietl fud- 
deiily upon him with his (hovel, (being all at work 
about their corn-land) and very fairly knocked the 
t>ruti(h creature down. Hereupon another liti^i/ijh- 
marty coming to his fellow's afTiftance, laid the jrood 
Spaniard on the earth ; when immediately tvro oiliers, 
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Jih'g- 
UJhman^ armed with an old ciitlafs, who woinuled 
them both. But this uproar foon reached our ears, 
who ru(hing out upon them, took the three Eughjlnien 
prifoners: And then, our next quiftion was, what 
{houldbcdone to fuch mutinous and impudent fellows, . 
fo furious, defperatc aj)d idle, that they were ir.ifchiev- 
ous to the higheft degree, and conftqucntly nut fafc 
for the fociifty to Icttnem live amqug them. 

Now, Sir, as I wa^s Governor in your abfejuT, fo I 
alfo took thy authority of a Judge j aixd having them ^ 
R 3 * brought 



. [ 2IO 3 

brought before rrie, I told them. That if they had beea 
of my countr)', I would hang every mother's (on of 
them ; but fmce it was an EngUJhman (meaning you, 
kind Sir) to whom we were indebted forourpreferva- 
tion and deliverance, I would, in gratitude, uie them 
with all pafliblc mildnefs ; but, at the fame time, 
leave them to the judgment of the two other Englifih 
nteu^ who, I hoped, forgetting their refentments, 
would deal impartially by them. 

Hereupon one of their countrymen ftood up : 5/r, 
fa id he, leave it not to usy for you may he fenfiblt tve 
have reafon to fentence theni to the gallows : Bejidcs^ Sir^ 
this fellow^ Will. Atkins, and the two other s^ propojed 
to us^ that we might murder you all in your Jleep^ wticb 
we would mt confent to ; but knowing their inability^ md 
your vigilance^ we did not think ft to di [cover it before. 

How, Seignior, faid I, do you hear what is alledgcd 
againtt you ? What can you fay to juftif)' fo horrid an 
a<!b'on as to murder us in cold blood ? So far. Sir, 
was the wretch from denying it, that he fworc, Damn 
him but he would do it ftill. But what have we done 
to you,- Seignior Atkins^ faid I, or what will you gain 
by killing us ? What fhall we do to prevent you ? Muft 
we kill you, or you kill us ? Why will you. Seignior 
Jtkins (faid I, fmiling) put us to fuch an unhappy ^ff« 
lemma^ fuch a fatal neceffity ? But fo great a rage 
did my fcoffing, and yet feyere jeft put him into, that 
he was going to fl) at me,^ and luidoubtedly had at- 
tempted to kill me, if poffefled of weapons, and had 
not been prevented by three Spaniards, This unpar-^ 
ralleled and villainous carriage made us ferioufly con- 
fider what was to be done. The two EngliJhmemxA 
the Spaniard^ who had faved the poor Indian^% life, 
mightily petitioned me to hang one of them, for an 
example to the others, which fhould be him that had 
twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, 
it being at that time impofliblc the poor flave ihould 
recover. But they could never gain my confent to put 

him 



[ 211 J 

him to death, for the rcafous above mentioned, fmcc 
It was an EngUfljman (even yourfcU) was my deli- 
verer : And, as merciful councils are moft prevailing, 
when earneftly preffed, fo I got them to be of the fame 
opinion, as to clemency. But to prevent them do- 
ling us any future mifchicf, we all agreed that they 
fhould have no weapons, as fwords, guns, powder 
or (hot, but be expelled from the fociety, to live how 
they picafed by themfelves : That neither the two 
Englijhmen^ nor the reft of the Spaniards^ fhould have 
converfation with them upon any account whatfo- 
ever : That they (hould be kept from coming within 
certain limits of our cafllc ^ and if they dared to 
ofFcf us any violence, either by fpoiling, burning, kill- 
ing or deftroying anv of the corn, plantings, build- 
ings, fences, or cattle, belonging to the fociety, we 
would fhoot them as freely as we would do beafts of 
prcy^ in whatfoever places we fliould perceive them. 

This fentcnce feemcd very juft to all but them- 
felves ; when, like a merciful Judge, I called out to the 
two honeft EngUJhmcn faying, you mufl confider they 
ought not to be ftarved neither ; and fmce it will be 
feme time before they can raife corn or cattle of their 
own, let us eive them fome corn to laft them eight 
months, and for feed to fow, by which time they will 
raife fome for themfelves. Let us alfo beftow upon 
them 6 milch goats, 4 he ones, and 6 kids, as well 
for their prefent fupport, as a farther increafe \ toge- 
ther with tools neceflary for their work, as hatchets, 
an axe, faw, and other things convenient to build 
them huts: All which, werq agreed toj but before 
they took them in poiTeflion, I obliged them folemnly 
to fwcar, never to attempt any thing againft u5 or 
their countrymen for the future. Thus difmiffing 
them from our fociety, they went away, fullen and re- 
fraftof y, as tho' neither willing to go nor ftay ; How- 
ever, feeing no remedy, they took what provifion waa 

givcu 



[ 212 ] 
given them, pretending to chufe a convenient place? 
where they might Jive by themfeJves. 

About five days after, they came to thofc limits 
appointed, in order for more riftiials, and fent me 
word by one of my Spaniards^ whom they culled to, 
Where they had pitched their tents, and marked them- 
felves out an habitation and plantation, at theiV. E. 
and mofi remote part of (he ifland. And indeed there 
they built thcmftlvcs twoyery handfome cottages, re- 
fembling our little caftle, being under the fide of a 
mountain, with fonflSc frees already growing on three 
fides of it 5 fo that planting a few more, it would have 
been obfcured from fight, unlefs particularly fought for. 
Whon thefe huts were finifhed, we ga\'e them fome 
dry goats flcins for bedding and covering ; and, on 
their giving us fuller fureties of their good behaviour 
for the future, we gave tkcm fome peas, barley, and 
rice for fowing, and whatever tools we could ipare. 

Six months did they live in this feparate condition, 
in which they got their firft harveft in, the qua^ti.y 
of which was but fmall, becaufe they had planted but 
little land : For indeed, all their plantations being Xb 
form, made it the more difficult, efpecially it being a 
thing out of their element. And when they werfe 
obliged to make their boards and pots, fcfr. they could 
make little or nothing of it. But the rainy feafon 
coming on, put them- into a greater perplexity, for 
want of a cave to keep their corn dry, ana prevent it 
from fpoiling : And fo much did this humble them, 
that they begged of my Spaniards to help them, to 
which the good natured men readily confented, and 
in four days fpacc worked a great hole in the fide of 
the hill for them, large enough for their purpofe, to 
fecure their corn and other things from the rain, 
though hot comparable to our's, which had feveral 
additional apartments. 

But a new whim poflTefltd thefe rogues about three 
quarters of a year afterwards, which had like to have 

ruined 



[ ^13 ] 
ruined us, and thcmi'elves' too : For it feems, being 
tired and weary of this fort of living, which made 
them work themfelves, without hopes of changing 
their condition, nothing would fcrve them, but they 
would make a voyage to the continent, and try if they 
could not feize upon fome of the favages, and bring 
them over, as flaves to do their drudgery, while they 
lived at eafe and pleafure. 

Indeed the projeft was not fo prepoftcrous; if they 
had not gone farther ; but they neither did, or propofed 
any thing, but what had mifchi;^ in the defign*, or 
the event. One morning thefe three fellows came 
down to the limited ilation, and humbly defired to 
be admitted to talk with us, which we reaaily granted. 
They to^ us, in fiiort, that being tired of their man- 
ner of livmg, the labour of their hands, in fuch em« 
ployments, hot being fufficient to procure the necef* 
faries of l(fe, they only defired one of the canoes we 
came over in, with fome arms and ammunition, for 
their defoice, and they would feek their fortunes 
abroad, and never trouble us any more. To be fure, 
we were glad enough to get rid of fuch wr,etched 
plagues i but yet honefty made us ingtnuoufly rcpre* 
lent to them, 'by what we ourfclves had fuffered, the 
certain deftruftion they were running into, either of 
beine ftarved to death, or murdered by the favages. 
To this they very audacioufly replied, that they nei- 
ther could nor would v/ork j and confequently, that 
they might as well be fiarved abroad as at home : And 
as to their falling into the hands of the favages ; why, 
if they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there 
. was an end of them ; they had neither wives or chil- 
dren to cry after them : Nay, fo intent were they upon .. 
their voyage, that if the Spaniards would not give 
them arms, fo they had but the canoe, they would go 
without. 

But though we could not well fpare our fire-arms, 
rather than they (hould go like naked men, we let 

them 



them ha\^c two mufkets, a piftol, a cqtlafs, and three 
hatchets, which were thought very fufficiertt : Wc 

Save thtin alfo goat's ficfh, a great biiiket full of 
ried grapes, a pot ofirefh butter, a young liVe kid^ 
«nd a large caaoc fufficient to carry t^^nty men. And 
thus, :with a maft made of a long pole, and a fail of 
ifix large. goat- fkins dried, having a fair breeze, and a 
flo >d tide with them, they failed merrily away, the 
Spaniards calling after them, Bon Veyajoy no man ever 
expeAtng to fee them again. 

When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englijb" 
fxen would often fay one to another, O h$w peaceable i9 
wue now live fince thofe turbulent fellows tjtroe left us I 
Nothing could be farther from their thoughts than to - 
liehold their faces any more ; and yet fcarcc two and 
twenty days had pafied over their neads, but one of 
the Emglijbmeny being abroad a planting, perceivtii at 
m diihuice, three men well armed, approaching to- | 
wards him. Away he flies with fpeed to our caftki 
and tells me and the reft, that we were all undone, fcr ^ 
that ftrangers were landed on the ifland, and who ' 
they were he could not tell, but added, that they wtff 
not favages, but men habited, bearing arms* Why 
then, fa id I, we have the Icfs occafion to be concernedy 
iince, if they are not Indians j they muft be friends) 
and I am.fure there is no Chriftian people upon earth, 
but what will do us good rather than harm. But . 
while we were coiifidering cf the event, up came the 
three Englijh?tten^ v/hofe voices we quickly knew, and 
fo all our admiration of that nature ceafed at once. 
And our wonder was fuccccacd by another fort of 
enquiry, which was. What could be the occafion of 
their returning fo quickly to the ifland, when we little 
expected, and much lefs dcfircd their company ? But, 
as thN was better to be related by themfelves, I ordered 
them to be brought in, and they gave me the follow- 
ing relation of their voyage. 

After two days fail, or fomc thing lefs, they reached 

land

Upon which they beckoned to them, pointing ^^ ^^

t appeared in the eaft the next morning, they wou,d 
jring them fome : And indeed they were as good a« 
heir words, for by that time they brought 1 1 RiCn 
uid 5 women, juft as (6 many cows and ox^n arc 
^ ^ J ' brought 



[ 2l6 1 
brought to fea-port towns, to viftual a Qiip. But as 
brutiih as thefe Englijhmen were, tiieir.ftomachs turned 
at the fight. What to do in this cafe they could not 
tell : To refufe the prifoners, would have been the 
highefl affront oft'ered to the favage gentry ; and to 
diipofe of them, they knew not in what manner. How- 
ever, they rcfolved to accept them j and fo gave them, 
in return, cine of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, 
and fix or feven of their bullets j things which, 
though wholly i2:norant of, they feemed entirely con- 
tented with ; anct dragging the poor wretches intq the 
boat, with their hands bound behind them, delivered 
them to the Englijhmen, But this obliged them to put 
off as foon as they had thefe prefents, left the donors 
might have expected two or three of them to be killed, 
and to be invited to dinner the next day : and fo tak- 
ing leave, with all poflible refpeft and thanks, though 
neither of them underftood what they could &y, they 
failed away back to the iirft ifland, and there fet eight 
of the men prifoners at liberty. In their voyage, 
they endeavoured to comfort, and have fome com- 
munication with the poor captives ; but it was im- 
poflible to make them fenfible of any thing ; and no- 
thing they could fay, or give, or do for them, could 
make them otherwife perfuaded, but that they were 
unbound only to be devoured. If they gave them any 
food, they thought it was only to fatten them for the 
(laughter ; or looked at any one more particularly, the 
poor creature thought itfelf to be the firft facrilice: 
And even when they brought them to our ifland, and 
began to ufc them with the greateft humanity and 
kindncfs ; yet they cxpccSed every day their new 
matters would devour them. 

And thus, Sir, did thefe three ftrange wanderers 
conclude the unaccountable relation of their voyage, 
which was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon 
I aflced them where their new family was \ They told 
me, they had put them into one of tneir huts, and they 

canie 



[ "7 J 
came to beg feme viAuals tor them. I'his, rndc^-r!, 
0Aade.u$. long to fee themj and fo, taking Fridtiys 
father with us, leaving only two at our caiile, wc 
^amc down to behold thcfc poor creaturjs. 

When we arrived at the hut (bring bound again by 
the Englifljmen^ for fear of efcaping) there they all far, 
ftark naked, expedling their fatal tragedy: There- 
were three lufty comely men, well (haped, with ftrait 
and fair limbs,, between thirty and nve and thirty 
years old; and five women, two of whom might be 
from thirty to forty, two more not above four and 
twenty ; and the laft, a comely tall maiden of about 
fevjcnteen^ Indeed all the women were very agree- 
able, both, in their proportion and features, except 
being tawny, which their modeft behaviour and othcT 
graces made amends for, when they afterwards came 
to be cloathed. 

'Their naked appearance, together with their mife- 
rablc circumfhuiccs, was no very comfortable fight 
to my ^anierds^ who, for their parts, I may venture. 
Sir, «vitnout flattery, to fay, are men of the bcft be- 
haviour^ caltneft tempers, and fweeteil natures, that 
can poffibly be : For they immediately ordered FnW^'^'s 
father to fee if he knew any of them, or if he undcr- 
ftood what.they could fay. No fooner did the old /«- 
dian appear^ but he looked at them with great feriouf- 
neft ; yet,.not being of his nation, they were utter 
ilrangers to him, and none could underihnd his 
fpeech, or figns, but one woman. This w;is enough 
to anfwer the defign, which was, to alfure them they 
would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of 
Chriftians, who abhorred fuch barbarity. When thty 
were fully fatisfled.of this, they exprefled their joy by 
fuch ftrange geltures, and uncommon tones, as arc 
not poffiblc for me to-defcribe. But the woman, their 
interpreter, was ordered next to enquire, whether they 
were content 'to be fervants, and would work for the 
men who had brought them hither to fave their lives i 
S Here- 



[ 2l8 J 

Hereupon (bcrng by this time unbound) they fell a ca- 
pering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her 
ihoulders, and t'other that, intimating that they were 
willing to do any thing for them. But now. Sir, 
having women among us, and dreading that it might 
occafion fome ftrife, if not blood, I afked the three 
men what they would do, and how they intended to 
ufe thefc ^creatures, whether as fervants or women? 
One of them very pertly and readily anfwered, they 
would ufe them as both. Gentlemen, faid I, as you 
arc your own mafters, I am not going to reftrain you 
from that; but methinks, for avoiding difientions 
among you, I would only defu"e you to engage. That 
none of you will take more than one for a vromanor 
a wife ; and that having taken this one, none elfe 
fhould prefume to touch her ; for though we have not 
a pricftly authority to marry you, yet it is but reafon* 
able, that whoever thus takes a woman^' fliould'U. 
obliged to maintain her ; fmce nobody dfe has anv 
thing to do with her : And this indeed appeared fo luft 
to all prefent, thatitwas unanimoufly agreed to^ iThen 
the EngUJhmen aflced my Spaniards yvrhethex they de* 
figned to take any of them ? But they al! anfwered 
No ; fome d'eclarnig, they had already wives in Spaing 
and others, that they cared not to join with infidels. * 
On the reverfe, the EngUJhmen took each, of them a 
temporary wife, and fet up a new method of living. 
As to Friday\ father, the Spaniards^ and the three 
favage fervants we had taken in the late battle, they 
all lived with me in our ancient caftle ; and indeed 
wc fupplied the main part of the ifland with food, as 
irccfTity required. But the moil remarkable part of 
the llory is,^ how thefe EngUJhmtny ysfho had been fo 
much at variance, fhould agree about the choice of 
thefe women j yet they took a good way enough to 
prevent quarrelling among themfelves. They fet the 
five women in one of their huts, and going them- 
felves to the other, drew lots which ihould have the 

firft 



[ 219 ] 

iirft choice. Now he that had the firft went to the 
hut, and fetched out her he chofe j and it is remark- 
able, that he that chofe firft, took her that was ac- 
counted the mofl' homely, and eldcft of the number, 
which made the reft of the ^;i^/r^;f^ exceeding merry, 
and theS^j»itfri^thcmfeIves could not but fmileat it : 
But, as it happened, the fellow had the bcft thought, 
in chufing one fit for application and bufincfs ; and 
indeed (he proved the beft wife of all the parcel. 

But, when the poor creatures perceived themfclvcs 
placed in a row, and feparated one by one, thejr were 
again feized with an unfpeakable terror, as thinking 
they were now going to be (lain in earneft : And when 
thtEngliJhman came to take the (irft, the reft fet up a 
lamentable cry, clapt their arms around her neck, 
and hanging about her, took their laft farewcl, as 
they thought, in fuch trembling agonies, and affec- 
tionate embraces, as would have (oftened the hardeft 
heart in the world, and made the drieft eyes melt into 
watery tears : Nor could they be perfuaded, but that' 
they were going to die, till fuch time as Friday^s fa- 
ther made them fcnfible, that the EngUJhmen had 
chofcn them for their wives j and fo ended all their 
^ terror and concern upon this occafion. 
' Well, after this, the EngUJhmen went to work, and, 
being aflxfted bv my good-natured favages, in a few 
hours they ereaed every one of them a new hut or 
tent, for their feparate lodging, fmce thofc they had 
already were filled with tools, houfhold-ftuff and 
provifion. They all continued on the north (hore of 
the ifland, but feparate as before j the three wicked 
ones pitched farther off, and the two honeft men 
nearer hand to our caftie : So that the ifland fecmed 
.to be peopled in three places, three towns beginning 
to be built for that purpofe. And here I cannot but 
remark, what is very common, that the two honeft 
raenliad the worft wives (I mean as to indultry, 
JS 2 clcaci- 



cleanlinefs and ingenuity) while the three repfohat^ 
enjoyed wcme^ otthe contrary perfeiSlions. 

Rut anotlier obfervation I made is in favour of the 
two honcft men, to (hew what difpfarity there is be* 
tween a diligent application to bufinefs, on the one 
hand, and a flothful, negligent, and idle temper, on 
the other. Both of them had an equal parcel of 
ground laid out, and corn to fow fufficient for them; 
but both did not make the fame improvenirnts, either 
in their cultivation or in their planting. The two 
honeil: men had a multitude of young trees planted 
about their habitations, fo that when you approached 
near them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleafing 
and delightful. Every thing they did, profpcred ana 
ftouriflied ; their grapes, planted in order, feemed at 
tliougb managed m a vineyard, and were infinitely 
preferable to any of the others. Nor were thejr want- 
ing to fijid QUtd place pf retreat ; but due a cave in 
the moft retired part of a thick vrvjij to ftcure "thar 
wives and children, with their provifion and chiefcft 
goods, fufrouhded with innumerable ftakes, and had 
the moft fubtle entrance, in cafe any mifchief (hould 
happen, either by their fellow countrymen, or the 
devouring favages. 

As to the reprobates (though I muft own they were 
much more civilized than before) inftettd of a delight- 
ful wood furroundin^ their dwellings, we found the 
words of King Solomon too truly verified : I %Oeni bj 
the vineyard of the Jkthful^ and it was ovetgrnvH 
with tfjoms. In many places their, crop was obfcured 
by weeds; the hedges, having feveral gaps in them, 
the wli goats had got in and eaten up the corn; 
and here and there was a dead bufh, to {k>p in thofe 
gaps for the prefent, which was no more than (hut- 
ting the fhible-door after the ftecd was ftolen away. 
But for their wives, they (as I obferved before) were 
more diligent, and cleanly enough, efpecially in their 
victuals, being inftrudted by one of the honeft men, 

who 



•[ 221 ] 

(rho was a ccok's mate on board a (hip : And very 
ivcll it was fo, for, cooking himfclf, his companion 
and their families lived as well as the idle hufbands, 
who did nothing btrf loiter about, fetch turtles eggs, 
catch fifli and birds, and any thing but work, and 
they lived accordingly ; while the diligent lived very 
handfomely and plentifully, in the nioft comfortable 
manner. 

And now. Sir, t am come to lay before your eyes 
a fcene, quite different from aay thing that ever hapr 
pened to us before; and, perhaps, ever bcfel you in 
all the time of your refidencc on this ifland : I (hall 
inform you of its original in the following manner. 

One morning. Sir, very early, there came five or fix 
canoes of Indians on fhore, indifputably upon their • 
old cuftom of devouring their prifoners. All that we 
could do upon fuch an occafion, was to lie concealed \ 
and they, not having any notice of the inhabitants, , 
would depart quietly, after performing their bloody, 
execution. Whoever difcovcrcd thcfc favages firft, 
was to give notice to all the three plantations, to keep ' 
within doors ; and then a proper fcout was to be 
placed, to give us intelligence of their departure. 
Buty notwithftanding thefewifemeafures, an unhap- 
py difafter expofed us to the knowledge of the favages, 
which had like to have caufed the (kfolation of the 
whole -ifland : For, after the favages were gone off in * 
their canoes, fome of my Spaniards and I, looking . 
abroad, and enflamed with .a curiofity to fee what 
they had been doing herej to our great amazement, 
we beheld three favages faft aflecp . on the ground, 
who either being .TOrged, could not awake <whcn the * 
others went.; or, having ^wandered too* far into tlie«* 
wo^ds, did not come back in time. . 

What to do with them at.firft, we could not'tclh 
As for flaves we had enoujrfi of them already ; and as 
to- killing them, neither Cnriftiani^y, nor humanity, , 
would iuffer us to jQicd innocent s loOv! , who Jiev r : lid 



uj- virong, anJ ilKTeforc bad no juft qtiarrcl againft 
them, to iuftify our raking their lives away. Wc 
ptrccivtd tlity had no boat left them to tranfport tfieiil 
to their own nation ; and that, by letting them wan- 
der about, they might difcover us, and inform the flrft 
ravages that (hould happen to land on the famb 
bloody occafion ; which information might entirely 
ruin US; and therefpre I counfelled my Spaniards to 
fecurc them, and fet ttiem about fome work or other, 
till we could better difpofe of them. 

Hereupon w^ all went back, and, making them 
awake« took them prifonct??. It is impofTible to ex- 
prefs tne horror they were in, cfpecially when bounds 
as thinking they were going to be murdered and catcji ; 
but vre foon eafed them of their fear as to that poinfe 
Wc firft took them to the bower, where was the chirf 
of our country work ; as keeping goats, planting 
com, if^c, and then carried them to the two Englijh- 
men's habitation, to help thc'm in their bufinefs : But 
happy it was for us all, wc did not carry them to our 
caiHe, as will appear by the fequel. ■ The Euglijhm^ 
indeed found them work to do ^ but, whetlver-thejr 
did not? guard them ftridly, or that they thought 
they could not better thcmfelvcs> I cannot tell 9 -but 
certainly one of them ran away into the woods, aintf 
they could not hear of him for a long time after. 

Undoubtedly there was reafon enough to fiippofe 
he got home in fome of the canoes, the favages re* 
turning in about four week's time, and going off ill 
the fpace of two days. You may be certain. Sir, thift 
thought could not but ferrify us exceedinglv ; • and 
made us juftly conclude, that this favag:ewouTo inform 
his countrymen of our abode in the ifland, hbw^fetr 
and weak we were in comparifon to their numbers'; 
expefting it would not be long before the Engliflmtn 
would be attacked in theil- hspbitationsi ; but the fa* 
vages had not feen their places of fafety in the wood, 
nor our caftle, which it was a great happinefs thc^ 
flid' not know. . Nor 



[ M3 ] 

Nor were we miftaken in our thoughts upon thii 
occafion : For about eight months after this, fix ca- 
noes of favages, with about ten men in each canoe, 
came failing by the north fide of the ifland, which 
they were never accuftotned to do before, and landed 
about an hour after fun-rife, near a mile from the 
dwelling of the two Englijhmen;, who, it fcems, had 
(he good fortune to difcovcr them about a league off ( 
fo that it was an hour before they could attain the 
{bore, and it required fome longer time before they 
could come at them. And being now confirmed in 
this opinion, that they were certainly betrayed, they 
immediately bound the two flaves which were left^ 
CHufins two of the three men, whom they had brought 
with the women, and who proved very faithful, tb 
lead them, with their wives, and other conveniencies, 
into their retired cave in the wood, and. there to bind 
the two fellows hand and foot till they had further 
orders. Then they opened their fences where thejr 
-kept their milch goats, and drove them all out, giving; 
the goats liberty to wander in the woods, to amuic 
'the lavages that they-wcre wild ones ; but the flave 
•had given a truer information. Which made them 
come to their very inclofures. The two frighted men 
fent fhe'other flave of the three, who had been with 
them by accident' to alarm the Spaniards^ and defirc 
^their sffiftance; in the mean time they took their 
arms and ammunition, and made to ithe cave when: 
•they had fent their wives, and, fecuring their flaves, 
-fisated themfelves in a private place, from whence 
-thev might behold all -thoadbions of the favages. Nor 
'had they gone far, and afcended a rifing ground, but 
'they could fee a little army of Indians approach tb 
-their beautiful dwelling ; and, in a few moments mors, 
perceived the fame, and their furniture," to their un- 
fpeakable grief, burning in a confuming flame : And 
when this was done, they fpread here ajid there, fearcb- 
ixi^ every buih and place for the people, of whom it 
; ^ was 



[ "4 I 
jpras very evident they had information. Upon which 
the two Englijhmmj not thinking themfelves fecure 
where they iiood, retreated about half a mile farther 
in the country, rightly concluding that the farther 
the favages ftrollcd, there would be the lefs number 
together : Upon which they took their next ftand 
where the trunk of an old tree ftpod, very hollow 
and large, where they refolved to fee what would offer. 
But they had not flood long there, before two" favages 
came running diredlly towards them, as though, 
having knowledge of their being there, they refolved 
to attack them. A little farther were three more, and 
five more behind them again, all running the fame 
way. It cannot be imagined what perplexity the po«r 
men were in at this fight, thinking that, if affiftance 
did not fpeedily come, their cave wouid be difcovered 
Jn the wood, and confequently all therein lofl. So 
they refolved to refift them there; and, when over- 
powered, would afcend to the top of the trees, where 
they would defead themfelves as long as their am- 
munition lafted, and fell theiL lives as dear as poffiblc 
to thofe devouring favages. Thus fixed ^vpon their 
refolution, they next confidered whedjef they (hould 
fire at the firft two, or wait for the^Kree, and fo take 
the ijiiddle party, by which the t;<^o firft and the five 
laft would be feparated. In thi^ regulation the two 
favages alfo confirmed them, by turning a littb to the 
other part of the wood; but >the three, and the five 
after them, came diredtly towards the tree. Hereupon 
they refolved to take them in a dire<3 line as they ap- 
proached nearer, becaufe the firft ihot ni\ght perhaps 
hit them .all three ; and upon this occafion, the man 
who was to fire charged his piece with three or four 
bullets. And thus, while they were waiting, the fa- 
vages came on : one of them was the run -away, who 
had caufed all their mifchief, fo they refolved he fhould. 
not cfcape, if they both fired at once. But however, 
though they did not fire together,, they .were ready 

charged;.. 



charged ; when the firft that let flv was too good a 
markfman to mifs his aim ; for he killed the foremoft 
outright ; the fecond» who was the run-away Indian^ 
fell on the ground, being Ihot through thebody, but 
not dead ; and the third wa& a little wounded on the 
flioulder, who fitting down on the ground, fell a 
fcreaming in a moft fearful manner. The noife of 
the guns, which not only made the moft refounding 
echoes, from one fide to another, but raifcd the birds 
of all forts, fluttering with the moft confufed noife, (fJi 
much terrified the five favages behind, that they ftood 
ftUl at firft like fo many inanimate images. But when 
every thing was in its nrft profound filcnce, they came 
to the place where their companions lay in a miferable 
condition : And here, not beinjz fenfible that they were 
liable to the fame fate, they ftood over the wounded 
man, undoubtedly enquiring the caufe of his fad cala^ 
mity J and^ as 'tis rcafcniblc t9. fi^ppofe, he told them 
that it. came by lightning and thunder from theGods^ 
having never feen or heard of a gun before, in the 
whole courfe of their lives. By this time the Eng* 
lijhmen having load^ their pieces, fired both together 
a fecond time, when, feeing them all fall immediately 
upon the ground, they thought they had killed every 
creature of them. Tnis made them come up boldly 
before thcv had charged their guns, which indeed was 
a wrong uep ; for, when they came to the place, they 
found four alive, two of them very little wounded, 
and one not all j which obliged them to fall upon them 
with their mufkets : They firft knocked therun-away 
favage on the head, and another that was but a little 
wounded in the arm, and then'put the other languifli-b 
ing wretches out of their pain j while he that was not 
hurt, with bended knees, and lift up hands, made pi-^ 
teous moans and figns to them to fparehis life : Nor 
were they indeed unmerciful to the poor wrctchj but 
pointed to him to fit down at the root of a tree hard 
lljr, and then one of the EngUJhmen^ with a piece yf 

rope 



[ 226 ] 

rope twine he had in his pocket by mere chance, tying 
his two feet faft together, and his two hands benind 
him, there they left him, making all the hafte they 
could after the other two, fearing they fhould find out 
their cave; but though they could not overtake them, 
yet tlicy had the iatisfadtion to perceive them, at a 
oiflance, crofs over a valley towards the fca, a quite 
contrary way to their retreat : Upon which they very 
contentedly returned to the trefc, to look after, their 
prifoner ; but when they came there, he was gone, 
leaving the pieces . of rope-yarn wherewith he was 
bound behind him« 

Well^ now they were as much concerned as ever, 
not knowing how near their enemies mi^ht be, or in 
what numbers : Immediately they repaired to their 
cave, to iee if all were well the^e, ai>d found everf 
thing fafe, except the women, who were frighted upon 
their hufbands accent* whom they nov loved en* 
tlrely. They had not been long here, before fevcn of 
my Spaniards came to affift them ; while the other ten, 
their fervants, and Friday^ father, were gone to de- 
fend their bower, corn and cattle, in cdfe the favagei 
(hould have rambled fo far. There acconipanied the 
feven Spaniards one of the three favages, that had 
formerly been taken prifoner ; and, with them alfo, 
that very Indian whom the Englijhmen had, a little be- 
fore, left under the tree ^ for it feems they paflcd by 
that way where the flaughter was made, and fo car- 
ried along with them that poor wretch that was left 
bound. But fo many prifoners now becoming a bur- 
then to us, and fearing the dreadful confequence of 
their efcaping, moft of the Spaniards and EngUJh urged 
the abfolute neceffity there was for killing them, for 
our common prefervation : But, Sir, the authority I 
bore as Governor overfwayed that piece of cru«ltyj 
and then I ordered them to be fent prifoners to the old 
cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, with two 
Spaniards to guard them. So 



[ 227 1 

So much encouraged were the Englijhmen^ at the 
approach of the Spamards, and To great was their fury 
againft the favages, for deflroying their habitations, 
that they had not patience to ftay any lunger ; but 
taking nve Spaniards along with them, anned with 
four mulkets, a piflol, and a quarter-ibff, ^^''^Z ^^^Y 
went in purfuit of their enemies. As they paUed by 
the place where the favages were flain, it was very 
cafy to be perceived that more of them had been there, 
having attempted to carry off their dead bodies, but 
found it impradicable. From a rifmg ground our 
party had the mortification to fee the fmoke that pro- 
ceeded from the ruins ; when, coming farther in light 
of the fhor^ they plainly perceived that the favages 
had embarked in their canoes, and were putting out 
to fea. This they were very forry for, thei'c being no 
coming at them, to give them a parting falutation : 
But, however, they were glad enough to get rid of 
fuch unwelcome guefts. 

Thus the two honcft, but unfortunate EngUJhmen^ 
being ruined a fecond time, and their improvements 
quite deftroycd, moft of my good-natured Spaniards 
helped them to rebuild, and we all helped them with 
needful fupplies : Nay, what is more remarkable, their 
three mifchievous countrymen, when they heard it 
^ which was after all thefc difaflers were over, they 
living remote eailward) fympathizcd with them in a 
Tcry friendly manner, and- worked for them fcvcral 
days i fo that in a little time their habitation was re- 
built, their necefTities fupplied, and themfelvcs reftored 
to their former tranquility. 

The favages had nothmg to boaft of in this adven- 
ture, fcvcral canoes being driven afhore, followed by 
two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with 
a ftorm at fea, that very night they departed. Nor 
can it be fuppofed otherwifc, butthofe, whofe better 
fortune it wattto attain their native fhore, would en- 
flame their nation to another ruinous attempt, with a 

greater 



r 2^8 ] 

greater force to carry all before them* And indeed (o 
it happened ; for about (even months after^ our ifland 
was invaded with a moft formidable navy, nolefs than 
eight and tweaity canoes full of ravage3, armed with 
wooden fwords/ monftrous clubs, bows and arrows, 
and fuch Jijce infiruments of war, landed that evening 
at ;he eaftcrmpft fide of the ifland. 

You may well. Sir, imagine, what conftemation 
our men were in upon this account,, and howfpeedy 
they were to execute their refolution; having only that 
night's time allowed them. They knew, that fuice 
they could not withfland their enemies, concealment 
was the only way to procure their fafety : And. there- 
fore they took down the huts that were built for the 
two EttgUJhmeny and drove their flock of goats, toge- 
ther with their own at the bower, to the dd cave in 
the valley ; they left as little appearance of inhabitants 
as poflible, and then .pofltcd thiemfelves with all thei; 
force, at the plantation of the two men. . As they ex- 
peded, fo it happened \ for early the next morning 
.the Indians^ leaving their canoes at the e^ift end of the 
ifland, came running along the ihore, about two 
hundred and fifty in number, as near as can be guefled. 
Our army was but little indeed ; and) what was our 
greater misfortune, we had not arms fuilicient for 
•them : The account, as to the men. Sir, is as follows.

|lett viAerf obtained ; but flaying to load their pieces 
again, difcovered the whole matter. They were per- 
ceived bvfome of the fcattering favagrs at a diibnce, 
who let fly their arrows among them* wounded Atkins 
himfitf, and killed his fellow Englifimmn^ and one of 
the IndUms taken with the women. Nor did our 
)^rty fail to anfwer them while they retreated, kHIin; 
above twenty favagcs ; And here I cannot but uke 

. notice of our poor djting flavc ; though ftopt from his 
^•trcat by a fatal arrow, yet with his ftaff and hatchet, 
her defperately and gallantly, aflailed the purfuers, and 

, kitlcd Ave* of the favagcs,. before his life fubmitted to

lice of the Indians to be lefs remarked, in breaking the 
arms, lc8;s, and heads^ of the two dead bodies, widi 
their clubs and woodeafwords, after a moft wretched 
maimer. Hereupon, our party was obliged to inter- 
P9rc between the favages and ^i/»j, who had le- 
treaied to a rifmg ground in the wood ; but after three 
volleys we were obliged to retreat alio ; for they were 
fo \cry numerous ami defpcrate, that they came to 
the very teeth of us, fliot their arrows like a cloud| 
^i their wounded men, enra^d with cruel pain, 
fought like madmen. They did not think fit to fbl' 
low us, but drawing themfelvcs up in a circle, they 
gave two triumphant fhouts, in token of viAor}*; 
though they had the grief to fce feveral of their 
WDundcd bleed to :dea€h before them. 
, ! After I had. Sir, drawn up our little army together 
Upon ^'. rtiing ground, Atkins^ wounded as he was 
woulJ have had us attack the whole body of the br

if you are not able to approach the enemy inthe 
mornings we will fight for you ^ trll then wc think it 
convenient to wait. 

By the brightncfs of the moon that night, wc per- 
ceived the faval^ in great difordcr, about their dead 
and wounded men. This made us change our leto- 
lution, by falling upon them in the night, if wc could 
give them one volley undifcovcred. And this we hiid 
a ftAr opportunit}' to do, by one o( the two EtfliJI}^ 
metfs leadine us round between the woods and the 
feti-fide weftwarJ, and turning fhort fouth, came 
privately to a place where the thickcfl of them were. 
Unheard, and unpcrceived, tight of us f; red among 
them, and did dreadful execution ; and, in half a mi« 
nute after, eight more of us let fly, kiliirig and wound- 
i.ig abundance of them ; and then, dividing ourfclvea 
into three bodies, eight pcri'ons in each body, we 
marched from among the trees to the very tMth of the 
enemy, fending forth the greateft fhouts and accla- 
mations. The favagcs, hearin^^ a different t\o\k from 
three quartets at once, itood in the utmod c<$hnirig^ ; 
but coming in fight ofu^, let fly a vu llcy of mows, 
M'iiich wounded poor old Friday^ yft happiijit iU not

we fired three fe\xnJ ways, and then fell to work 
with our fwords, ftavcs, hatchets, and the but-cnd of 
our mufkcts, with fuch fury as could not be refifted^ 
fo that fetjting forth the moft difmal fcreaming and 
howling, they had recourfc to their feet, to fave ihi^ir 
Jives bv a fpccdy flight. Nor muft we forget the va- 
lour or the two women, for they expofed thcmfclvcs 
to the ^rcatcft dangers, killed many with their arrow*, 
and valiantly deftroyed fcveral more with their hatchets. 

Indeed we were \o much tired in fighting thcfc twa 

battles, that we did not then trouble ourfelvc!^ to pur* 

fuc them to tkeir canoes, in which wc thought thoy

would ptefcntly put to the ocean : Qat there happened 
a dreadful ftonn at fca, which continued all that night, 
and not only^ prevented ^thcir voyage, but daflied fe- 
y^r^l of their boats to pieces againft the beach^ and 
drove the reft fo high upon' the fhore, as required in-', 
finite pains to get them olF again: After our men had 
taken fome refrefliiiient, and a little repofe, they re- 
folved to go towards the place of their landing early 
lA the mor-iiingy' and fee whether they were gone off, 
or in what pofturc they remained. Thi$ nccef&rily 
led them to the place of battle, where feveral of the (a- 
v^cs were expiring ; a iight no way'plcafing to ge- 
nerous miinds, to delight in their mifery, though

coiiviiigin view of the remainder of their army, we found 
theiiT leaning upon their knees, which were bended to- 
wards their mbuths, and the head between the two 
iiandk; Hereupon, coming' within mu(kct (hot of 
them, I ordered tWo pieces to be fired without ball, in

There is no doubt to fuppofe, but that the preced-

able, and no Icfs furprifing, to me, the young pricfti 
and to all that heard it : Nor were thcle people lefs

the Indians who aiTifted them, that when I viewed the 
Englijhmen^s colonics, they feemcd at a diftance^ as 
though they had lived like bees in a hive : For jyUl. 
jttkins^ who was now become a very induftrious aiid

round the outfide ; the walls were worked in clofe 
as a bafket. In pannels, or ftrong fquares of 32 in

mighty pretty, I aflure yoii, and joined very well to--

he had made bini a forge with a pair ofvfOoScsk beir

the Spenim'dt^ about their circumilances among the 
favagcs, they told nie» that they were a poor mifcr- 
able handful of people, that, having no means put into 
theirhands, were abandoned to defp^r, and thought 
cjf nothing but ftarving. ' One of them confciled, tna( 
diey YkXTQ, in the .wrong to think fo, and for refuiing 
the affiftance that rcafon offered for their fupport, as 
well as future deliverance : that grief was a inoft

of mind^ than thofe of any other country that he 
had met with; and that they, and the Fortuguezt^^ 
were the worft men in the world to ftruggle under* 
misfortune. When they landed among the favages^ 
they found but little provifion, unlefs diey would turn 
canibals ; thfere being but a few loots and herbs 
with little fubilance in them, and of which the na- 
tives gave them but very fparingly. Many were the 
ways they took to ci vilifc and teach the favaces, but 
in vain; nor would they own them to be their mftruc- 
tors, whofe lives were owing to their bounty. Their 
extremities were very great, being many days entirely- 
without food; the lavages there being more in- 
dolent, and lefs devouring, than thofe who had better 
fupplies. Whenever war happened, they af&fted thefe 
people, being compelled thereto, and by which, my

would live and 5}ie apiong them ; owning, -that what 
the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad humour 
.had made neceflary for thpm to do, Norhadthe Spa- 
iisards OQc:tCian tojuftjfy^this proceeding to Trie; but 
• they told me, that fince IfllL ktkins had behaved him- 
felf fo valiantly in fight, and.-at other .times {hcwd 
fuch a regard to the common intereft of -them aH, 
they had not only forgot all that was pa(l, but thought 
he ought to be as much tnrfted with arms ^ndneccf- 
faries as any of them, which they teltified by makii^g 
him command next to the Governor ; and -they rtm. 
heartily embraced the opportunity pf giving metfris 
folcmn alTurancc, that they would never feparatctheir 
intereft again as long as Xnty lived.' 

Well, upon thefc kind crcclarations of frxendfliip, 
wc appointed all of us to dine togetherthe next 4ay, 
on which I caufedthe fhip's cook, and his mate, to 
come on fliore for that purpofc, and the cook's mate 
oil, land ^ff^&^A them in drefling our dinner. We 
brought from the fliip fix pieces of beef, and ■f9ur of 
pork, together with our punph bowl, and materials to 
fill it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles gf 
/r/«fi claret, and ten o^ Englrfh beer, vvhich was very 
acceptable to them. The Spaniards added ^ to our 
feaft five whole kids ; which being roafted, three, of 
them were fent as frefh meat to the failors on board, 
and the other two we eat ourfelves. ♦' After our merry 
and innocent feaft was over, I began to diftribute my 
cargo among them ^ at firft, I gave them linen fuffi- 
cient to make every one of them 4 ftiirts, and, at the 
Spaniard's requeft, made them up fix. The thin Eiig- 
lijh ftufFs I allotted to make every one a light coat, 
like a frock, agreeable to the climate j and left than 
fuch a quantity, as to make more upon their decay ; 
as alfo for pumps,'j[hoeSj hats, and fteckings, I can- 
not 



[ 241 ] 

not cxprefs the pleafing fatisfadion which fat upon tlic 
countenances of thefc poor men, when they perceived 
what care I took of them, as if I had^ecn a common 
father to them all j and they all cngagednevcr to leave 
the ifland, till I gave my confent for their departure. 
T'hen I prcfcnted to them the people I brought j as 
the taylor, fmith, and the two carpenters ; but cfpe- 
cially my Jack of all trades, was a remarkable man 
among them. My taylor fell immediately to work, 
and made every one of them a ftiirt ; after which he 
learned the women to few and ftitch, tJiereby to be- 
come more helpful to their hufbands. Neither were 
the carpenters lefs ufcful, taking in pieces their 
clumfy thing*?, inftead of which they made conve- 
nient and handfomc tables, ftools, bcdfteads, cup- 
boards, lockers and fhelves. But when I carried 
them to fee /f7//. Atkinses bafket-houfe, they owned 
they never faw fuch a piece of natural ingenuity be- 
fore. Pm Jure^ faid one of the carpenters, tbr man 
that built this has no need of us ; you needy Sir^ do no- 
thing hut give him tools, 

1 divided the tools among them in this manner : To 
every man I gave a digging fpade, a fliovel, and a 
rake, as^ having no harrows or pl()ws ; and to tvt ry 
feparate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad axe, and 
a faw, with a ftore for a general fupply, fliould any 
be broken or worn out. I left them alfo nails, ft.iplcs, 
hinges, hammers, chiflels, knives, fciflars, and all 
forts of tools and iron work j and for the ufc of the 
fmith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron for a 
fupply : And as to arms and ammunition, I ftored 
them even to profufion, or at Icaft fufficient to equip 
a little army, againft all oppofers whatCocvcr. 

T'he young man (whofe mother was unfortunately 
ftarved to death) together with the maid, a pious and 
well educated young woman, feeing things fo wtH 
ordered on fliore rfor I made them accompany me) as 
alfo confidering tney had no occafion to go fo long a 
U voyage 



f 242 3 

vo}-a^c as to the Eaji-Indies\ they both dcfired of me, 
that Iwould leave them there, and enter them among 
mjr fubjeds. This I readily agreed to, ordering them 
a plat of ground, on which were three little houfcs 
ercclcd, environed with baflcet work, pallifadoed like 
jiikins^s^ and adjoining to his plantation. So con- 
trived were their tents, that each of them had a room 
apart to lodge in ; while the middle tent was not 
6nly their ftore-houfe, but their place for eating and 
drinking* At this time the two Englijhmm removed 
their h&itations to their former place ; fo that now 
the ifiand was divided into three colonies. Firft^ thefe 
I have juft now mentioned : Secondly y that of JfilL 
Atkins J where there were four families of EngUJhmen^ 
with their wives and children, the widow and her 
children ; the young man, and the maid, who (by 
the way) we made a wife of before our departure ; 
three favages, who were flaves ; the taylor, fmidi, 
(who ferved alfo as gunfmith) and my other cele- 
brated perfon, called Jack of all Trades, ThirJfyy my 
chiefcft colony confifted of Spaniards^ with old Fridajy 
at my old habitation, which was my capital city : 
And lurely never was there fuch a metropolis before, 
hid in fo obfcure a grove, that a thoufand men might 
have ranged the ifland a month, and looking purpofelj 
lor it, I believe, could not have found it j and they 
had enlarged its boundaries, both without and within, 
in a fccret and moft furprifmg manner. 

But now I think it high time to fpeak of the young 
French prieft, of the order of St. Benedi£fy whofe ju- 
dicious and pious diicourfes upon fundry occaCons, 
merit an extraordinary obfervation : Nor can his be- 
ing a French Paptjl Prle/i, I prefume give offence to 
any of my readers, when they have this aiTurance 
from me, that he was a perfon of the moft courteous 
dlfpofition, extenfive charity, and exalted piety. His 
'arguments were always agreeable to reafon, and his

and to fail to Newfoundland -, at the banks of which 
they met a French Ihip, bound to ^ebec^ in the river 
of Canada^ and from thence to Martinico : In this 
fhip he embarked, the matter of which jdying at ^w- 
hec^ that voyage was fufpended : And lamy, (hipping 
himfelf for France^ that fhip was deftroyed by the 
fury of the flames, as before has been related : And 
fo our difcourfe ended for that time. 

Another morning he comes to me, juft as I was 
going to vifit the Englijhmem colony, and tells me, 
That as he knew the profperity of the ifland was my 
principal defire, fo he had fomething to communicate 
agreeable to my defign, and perhaps rhight put itj 
more than he yet thought it was, in the way of the 
benediction of heaven. How, Sir ! faid I in aiurprize, 
are we not yet in the way of God's bleffing, after 
all thefe fignal providencies and deliverances, of which 
you have had fuch an ample relation \ He replied, I 
hope. Sir, you are in the way, and that your gooi 
defign will profper ; but ftill there are fome among 
you that are not equally right in their a6Wons : And 
remember, I befeech you. Sir, that Achan^ by his 
crime, removed God's blefling from the camp of the 
Children of Ifrad\ that, though fix and thirty were 
entirely innocent, yet they became the objeds of di- 
vine vengeance, and bore the weight of the punifh- 
mcnt accordingly. 

So fenfibly was I touched \rith this difcourfe, and 
fo fatisfied v/ith that ardent piety that enflamcd his 
foul, that I defired him to accompany me to the Eng- 
iijhmens plantations, which he was very glad of, by 
reafon thefe were the fubjecls of what hedefigned to 
difcourfe with me about. So we walked on together, 
and then he began in the following manner :

lure, or any occafion, forfake thefe women' to marry 
others, and by difowning their children, fufFer them 
utterly to periih. And now. Sir,* added he, can God 
be honoured in fuch an unlawful liberty as this ? How 
can a blelTing fuccccd the bcft endeavours, if men 
are allowed to live in open adultery? Indeed I was 
ftruck with the thing itfelf, and they were much to 
blame that no formalcontradl had bo^n made, though 
it had been breaking a ftick between them, to engage 
them to live as man and wife, never to fcparate, but 
love, cherifh, and comfort one another all their lives. 
But, Sir, faid I, when they took thefe women, I was 
not here ; and if it is adulterv, 'tis paft my remedy, 
and I cannot help it. *Tis true, bir, anfwcred the young 
Prieft, you cannot be charged with that part of tk 
crime which was done in your abfence : But, I be- 
feech you don't flatter yourfelf that you are under no 
obligation now to put a period to it ; which, if you 
negleft to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone, 
fmce it is certainly in nobodv's power but your's to 
alter their condition. I muft confefs I was fo dull, 
that I thought he meant I fhould part them, which, 
knowing it would put the whole ifland in confufion, 
I told him I could not confent to upon any account 
whatfoever. Sir, faid he in a great furprize, I do not 
mean that you fliould feparate, but marry them : I 
mean your way, by a written contradt, figned by 
both man and woman, and by all the witnefTes pre- 
fent, which all the European laws decree to be of fuf- 
ficient efficacy. Amazed with fuch true piety and 
fmcerity, ajid confidering the validity of a written 
contrao:, I acknowledged all that he faid to be very 
juft and kind, and that I would difcourfe with the men 
about it : Neither could I fee what reafon they couM 
have not to let him marry thtfm, whofe authority in 
that afFair is owned to be as authentic as if they were 
married bv any of our clergymen in England.

founded i and you know my circumftances, that be- 
ing bound to the Eq/l- Indies^ in a merchant*ihip, I 
cannot wrong the owners fo much, as to detain the 
Ibip here, the men lying at victuals and wages on 
their account. If I flay sibove twelve days, I muft ray 
Ti^ftirling^ per diem^ demorage, nor muft the mip 
itay above eight days more, fo that I'm unable to en- 
gage in this work, unlefs I would leave thelhip, and 
io be reduced to my former condition. The priefi, 
though he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid it to 
my confcience, . wbet^her the bleffing of feving fevqi 
and thirty fouls, was not worth venturing all that I 
had in the worl3 ? Sir, faid I, 'tis very true ; but, as 
you are an ecclefiaflic, it naturally falls into your pro- 
feffion : why there£oire don't ycu rather offisr to under- 
take it yourfelf, than prefs me to it ? Upon this he 
turned about, making a very low bow, I inof^ hum- 
bly thank God and you. Sir, faid he, for fo blefled a 
call, and mofl willingly undertake fo glorious an 0^ 
fice, which will fu£ciently cooifienfate all the di£E; 
cuities and hazards I have gone through, in a long 
and uncon^fortable voyage. 

Whii^ he was thus fpeaking, I could difcoycr a 
.rapture in his iace, by his colour going and coming » 
.at the fame time his eyes fparkled like fire; with all 
tide fign^ of the mofl zealous tranfport^. And when 
J afked whether he was in carnefl ? Sir, faid he, it was 
to preach to the Indians 1 qonfeiited to. cohi^ along

infiniteiy of more worth than my poor life ; and^ lb

Nothing now remained, but that the women were 
to be maoCe fenfible of the meaning of the thinz, 
with which being well fatisficd, they and their hut 
pands attended at my apartment the next morning: 
There was my Prieft, habited in a black veft, fooK- 
thing like a caflbck, with a fafli round it, much re- 
fembling aMinifter, and I was his interpreter. But 
the ierioufnefs of his behaviour,, and the fcniples be 
uiade of marrying the women who were not bap- 
tized, save them an exceeding reverence for his per- 
fon : Nor indeed would he marry them at all, till k 
obtained my liberty to difcourfe both with the men 
and women ; and then he told them. That, in tk 
fight of all indifferent men, and in the fenfe of the 
laws of fociety, they had lived in open adulter/i 
which nothing now, but their confent to marry, or 
final feparatipn, could put an end to ; and even here 
was a difficulty, with refpe£l to the laws of Chriftian 
matrimony^ in marrying a profelTed Chriflian'tcaa 
Heathen idolater, unbaptized ; but yet there was time 
enough to make them profefs the name of Chrif^ 
without which nothing could be done ; that befide^ 
he believed themfelves very indifferent Chrifti^s^ and 
confeguently had not difcourfed with their wives oq 
that fubje61: ; and that unlefs they promifed him to do 
6>y he could not marry them, as being exprefsly for- 
bidden by the laws of God. 

All this they heard attentively, and owned readily: 
But, Lord, Sir, faid ff^iil. Atkins to me, how fhouM 
we teach them religion, who know nothing^ of it our- 
felves ? and fhould we talk to our wives of trod, Jefus 
Chrift, Heaven and Hell, they would oply laugh ^ 
us, who never yet have pra^lifed religion, but on the 
contrary all manner of wicked nefs. Wilh Atkins^ 
faid I, can't you tell j^our wife (he's in the wrong, 
and that her Gods are idols, which can neither hear,

lite for men to repent in this world. I told Jthhs 
every word the Prieft had faiid, who then parted from 
us to talk to his wife, while we difcourfed with the 
reft : But thofe were very ftupid in religious matters, 
yet all of them prom i fed to do their endeavours to 
make their wives turn Chriftians ; and, upon theie 
pjomifes, the Prieft married the three couple. But, 
as jftkins was the only finccre convert, and of more 
fenfe than the reft, my Clergyman was earneftly en- 
quiring after him : Sir, faid he, let's walk out of this 
labyrinth, and I dare fay we fhall find this poor man 
preaching to his wife already. And indeed wc found 
it true 5 for, coming to the edge of the wood, we per- 
ceived Atkins and his favage wife, fitting under the 
fhade of a bufli in very carncft difcourfe : He pointed 
to the fun, to the quarters of the earth, to himfelf, 
to hcr^ the wood, and the trees. . Immediately we 
could perceive him ftart upon his feet, fall down upon 
his knees, and lift up both his hands ^ at which the 
tears ran down my Clergyman's cheeks ; but our great 
misfortune was, that we coukl not hear one word 
that pafled between them. Another time he would 
embrace her, wiping the tears from' her eyes, kiffing 
her with the greateft tranfports, and then both kneeled 
down for fomc minutes together. Such raptures of 
joy did this occafion in my young' Prieft, that he 
could fcarcely contain himfelf : And a little after this, 
v/e obfcrved by her motion, as frequently lifting up 
her hands and laying them on her brcaft, that flie 
was mightily affe£ted with his do£lrine y and fo they 
withdrew from our fight. » 

When wc came back, we found them both waiting 
to be called in ; upon which we agreed to .examine 
him alone, and fo I began thus to difcourfe him. Pri- 
thee, TFilL Atkinsy faid I, what education had you ? 
What was your father ? 

IF, A. A better man than ever I fhall be : He was, 
Sir, a Clergyman, who gave me good inftruftion, or

murdered my poor father.

Vfcnfty thafGod woulJ inftrudl her hy his holy fpirit-i 
and that fome time God, by his providence, woidd 
i<uid th6ni a Bible for both their iiidrudioii. . And luch 
was the eaily piety of this new ct)jivert, that fhe made- 
him promife never to forfake God any morcj left, be- 
ing made dead, as fhe called it, ihefhould not only want 
her inftruiStor^buthimfelfbemiferablein along ctcunity., 
. Such a furpriilng^ account as this was, provcd^vcry 
affecting to us both, but particularly to the yo.iing. 
CJergyman,who was mightily conccrnc4he could not 
talk to her hi(nfelf : Sir, faid he, there, is fomcthing 
more to be done to this woman than to marry her : 
I, mean that (he ought to be baptized. To this I prc- 
fen^ly agr/ccd : Pray, faid he again, a(k,.hcr hufband, 
whfitluT he h^s ever talked to ner of JefusChiiA, the 
ialvationiof fmners, the nature of faith and redemp- 
tion in and by him, of the holy fpirit, the re furrec- 
tion, lafl judgment aiid a future ftate^ but die poar 
fellow melted into tears at this queftion, faying, 
that he had faid fomcthing to her of thcfe things, but 
his own confcicnce. terrifying him with the xnq% 
dreadful apprehenfions, he was afraid left her knowledge 
of it (hpuld rather make her contemn religion, than. 
embrace it y, but if I would difcourfe witUTicr, it was 
probable my lal^our would not be in vain. Actording-r 
ly I called her in, and placing myftif as intciprctep 
between th^ reli[j;ious prlclt- and the woman, ifj en- 
treated him to go on : But fu rely never w;is fuch a. 
&rmon py<*^ched by anv clergyman in thcfe latter 
days of the world,, which had fo much zeal, know- 
ledge and fincerity :• in ftiort, he brought the woman. 
to e^nbracethe knowlegeof Chrift, ajiuof jedemption 
by him, with. fofurpriung a degree of undcifLindi^ig, 
tliat fhe made it her own rcq^ucft to be baptized. 

And now Iv: pjr formed his ofnce in the facraincnt 
of Baptifm, flrft by faying fome words over to himi'clf 
in Latin, and thcn,-.ailcing me to givc.jicr a n4::r.e, as 
being her godfiithcr, he poured a wJtioL difliful .gC 
^ ' X 3 water 



r »58 > 

U'atff upon the woman's head, faying,- MARY, I 
baptize thee in the name of the Fatlusr, . and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ohoft, <b that hone could know 
tvhat religion he was of; and after, he pronounced tbe 
benediction in Latin. Thus, the woman beii^ made 
« Chriftian, he married her to Will. Atkins^ which be« 
ing finilhed, he affedionately exhorted -him t& lead a 
boly life for the future ; that, fince the Almighty, tjr 
the conviAions of his confcience, liali honoured bim 
to be the inftniment of his wife's converiion^ be fliouM 
not difhonour the grace of God, left, while die (avoge 
v^as converted, the inftniment fbould be call iwaj. 
And thus end^ the ceremony, which made it the mod 
pleafant and agreeable day I ever pafled in my life. 

The affairs of the iflan'd being fettled, I was pre- 
paring to go on board, when the yottng man, whofe 
mother was ftarved) came to me, feying, Tluit, u 
be undcrftood I had a clergyman with me, i^ hal 
married the EngUJhmm with favages, he had a match 
to make between two Chriftians, which he defiid 
might be finifhed before I departed. But, thinking it 
was himfelf that had courted his mother's maid, I 
perfuaded him not to do any thing raflily upon theao 
count of his folitary circumftances ; that the maid 
was an unequal match for him, both in refpc6l to fub- 
ftance and years ; and that it was very probable he 
would live to return to his own countri', where he 
mi^ht have a far better choice. At thc4 words, he 
fniilingly interrupted me, thanking me for my good 
advice; that, as he had nothing to beg of me, but a 
fmall fettlement, with a fervant or two, or fome few 
neceflaries ; fo he hoped I would not be unmindful of 
him when I returned to England^ but give his lettets 
to his friends ; and that, when he was redeemed, die 
plantation, and all its improvements, however va- 
luable, ihould be returned to me again : But, as for 
the marriage he propofcd, why truly it was between 
my Jack of all Trades, and the maid Sufan. 

Indeed 



f «» 1 

Indeed I was smecMy furpriicd at the rtiemioning 
this -matdi, whia feemed very fuitable ; the one be- 
ing a very ingenraus fellow, and the other an excel- 
biity tletxterous, and fcnfible houfe-wife, fit to be 
pivemcfi nfthe whole ifland : So we married them 
theXame day ; and as I was her father, and gave her 
kway,:fi» I pn^e her a handibme portbn, and appointed 
ber and her huiband a large convenient fpace of 
ground ibr their plantation. The fliaring out of the 
land to them, 1 left to H^U. Atkinsy who really very 
fuiftly divided it to every peribn's fiitisfadion : Th» 
Mily defined one general writing, under my hand, w 
the whole, which I cauied to k drawn up, figned and 
lealed to them, fetting out their bounds, and giving 
them a right to the whole pol&fion of than' icfpeAive 
pfauitations, with their improvcmenta, to them and 
Elieir hein, referving all the reft of die ifland as my 
Mvn property, and a certain rent for every particubar 
plantation, after 1 1 yean. As to their bws and go- 
wmoMnt, I exhorted them to loipeone another : And 
10 to the Jkdlmuj who livod in a neck by themftlves^ 
[ alloitod three or four of them plantations, and the 
reft willingly chofe to become ibvanti to all the other 
families, by which means they were cmplo3red in ufe- 
fUl labour, and fared much better than they did be- 
fore. Thus the lavages, being mixed with the 
Chriftians, the woric or the converfion of the Indians 
Biieht be fct on foot by die latter, in the ck-reyman's 
ibfence, to our equal btisfiifHcm. Bat how, usd the 
Ifoung Priefl, fhall I know that the Chriftians will do 
their parts to inftrucl them ; I told him we would call 
them all together, that he fhould fyeak to the Spa- 
wisrdfj who were Papifts, and I to the Englijhy who 
wort; Pkoteftants, and make them pmaik that th^ 
would never make any diflindion in religion, but teacn 
the general true knowledge of God, and his Son Jefus 
Chrift, in order to convert the poor fiivaecs : And 
this indeed they all promifed m accoidingfy. 

When 



: Wten I camfe to Tf^il yftiins^s houfe, *! found 'his 
baptized wife, and the youfig woman neivly married 
l^o my Jack. oJF alt Trades, were become great inti- 
Ynateie, and difcourring of religion together : O Sir, 
faid ff^iL AtkinSj when God has Tinners to recondk 
to hinifelf, he never wants an inftrudlor : I knew I 
was unworthy for fo good a work, and therefore this 
young woman has bein fent hither, as itiwerefraa 
hc?.ven, who is fufHcient to convert a whole iflandof 
favages. 7*he } oung woman blufhed, and was goitt 
to 1 iO,. but I defired her to fit ftiil, and hoped thatGoi 
would blefs her in fo good a v/ork : And then, pulling 
ont a Bible, which I brought on purpofe in Of 
pocket for him ; here Atkins^ Taid I, here is an affi&ot 
that perhaps you had not before. So confounded wtf 
the poor man, that irwas fome time before he covif 
fpeak ; at laft, turning to his wife, my dear, faid hci 
did I not tell you that God could hear what we faid I 
Here is the book I prayed for when you and I kneele^ 
iindcr the buih : God then heard us, and now htf 
icnt it. The woman was furprifed,- and thought G|d 
had really fent that individual book from heaven ; M 
I turned to the young woman, and deflred her to ex- 
plain to the new convert, that God may properly be 
faid to anfwcr our petitions, when, in the courfecf 
his Providence, fuch particular things as wc petitioned 
•for come to pafs. i'his the young woman did ef- 
fecSlually ; but furely IPllL Jtkins's joy cannot beefr 
preifed, no man in the world being more thanklul fe 
any thing, than he was for this bible, nordefireit 
from a better principle. 

After feveral religious difcourfes, I dcfired the youiK 
woman togive me an account of the anguifh uiefelt 
when fhe was ftarving to death for. hunger ; to which 
ihe readily confentcd, and began in the following 
manner :

afterwards received from your hands.

what to thinic of it , but imagined we (hould all be de*

them. Wcr.ccordingly did fo, snd furled all our fails: 
As to the favages, we feared nothing but their fetting 
the {hip on Arcj to prevent which, I ordered them 
to get their boats out, andfaftcn them, one clofe by 
the head and the other by the ilern, well manned, 
with fheets and buckets to cxtingoifh the Aames,' 
fhould it fo happen. But when the favages came up, 
they were a horrid fight indeed, but there were not 
fo many as the mate had faid; for, infleadof a thou- 
fand canoes, tlure were about one himdrcd and twcn-* 
ty, though indeed they were too many, feveral of thcfe 
canoes containing above fixtcen or fevcnteen men. 

As'they approached near us, they feemed to be in the 
greateft amazement, and not knowing what : to make 
pf us, they rowed round the (hip, which occafioned 
us to call to the men in the boats, tiot to fufFer them 
to coitie near them. Hereupon they beckoned to the fa« 
vages to keep back, which they accordingly did ; but, 
at their retreat, they let fly about 50 arrows among 
us, and very much wounded one of our men in the 
long- boat. I called to them not to iirc upon any ac- 
count, but handing them down fome deal boards, tho 
carpenters made them a kind of fence to fhieki themr 
from the arrows. In half an hour after, they cama 
fo near a-ftcrn of us, that wc had a perfed fight of 
them; then they rowed a little i art her out, till they 
came directly broad fide with us, and then approached 
fonearas they could hearusfpeak. This made me order 
. . .all

all our men to keep dofe, and get their guns ready; 
in the mean time I ordcred| Fridm^ to go out u|N)a

No fooner did he fe, but fix of the favagea, who 
were in the focemoft canoe, fkooping down, ihewcd

ftiield us from danger : And having got ready our fire- 
arms, we returned them a volley, which no doubt 
wounded fcvci-al. of them, as v/e could hear by their 
cries. In this condition we lay till break of dajs 
and then, making fignalsof diftrefs to the £hip, which 
:r.y nephew, the captain, heard and underftood, he 
weighed anchor, and flood as near the ihorc as pof- 
fibie, and then fent another boatv/ith lo-hands in her 
to uilid ur. J but we called to theni not to come near, 
Informing them of our unhappy condition : However

rudenefs to the maid, at which the old woman fct 
up a great cry ; nor wouhd the failors part from their 
prize, but carried her among the trees, while the old 
woman went and brought a whole army down upon 
them." At the becinnmg of the attack one of our men 
was killed with a hnce, and the fellow who be^au 
the mifchicf, paid dear enbugh for his mcf^rt-fs, thou;;h 
as yet we did not know ^Vhat became of him, but the 
reft got free. The third night after the aftion, being 
curious to underftand how affairs ftood, I took the 
fupercargo, and twenty ftout fellows with me, and 
landed about two hours before midnight, at the fame 
place where thofe Indians ftood the night; before ; and 
there we divided our men into two bodies, the boat- 
f^vain commanding one, and I .the other. . It was fo . 
dark, that we could fee nobody ; neither did we hear 
any voice near us : but by ana by the boatfwoin falli .

off'fafe en^'iigh ; and lo away they went, notwithftitnd- 
ing ail my admonitions, cither concerning their own 
fi;tety, or the prelcrvaiioR of the fhip. Indeeci they 
^verc gallantly armed, every n:an having a miifk^t, 
bayonet, and a piftol, bcfides ciitlafles, hangers, pole- 
axes, and hand-granadoes. They came to a few A- 
ulan houfcs at firft ; but, not bein^ the town they 
c>. pecked, they went farther, and finding a ccw tiej 
to a tree, they concluded that would be a fufficirnC 
guide to them, and fo it proved ;for after they untied 
her, fhe led them dirc£Hy to the town, which confift- 
cd of above two hundred houfes, feveral families liv- 
ing in fome of the huts together. Here, being all ina 
profound flecp, the failors confulted to divide them- 
felves into three bodies, and fet three parts of the town 
on lire at once; to kill thofeti^t were efcaping, and 
plunder thp reft of the houfes. Thus defperateiy rc- 
folved, they went to work ; but the firft party bad • 
not gone far, before they called out to the reft, that 
thcyhad found Tom yeffery\ whereupon they all ran 
up to the place, and found the poor fellow indeed, 
lianging up naked by one arm, and his throat almoft 
cut from car to ear: In a houfe that was hard by the 
tree, they found 16 or 17 Indians who had been con- 
cerned in the fray, two or three of them being wound- 
<!d, v^ho were not gone to fleep ; this houfe they fet 
on tire firfl, and quickly, five or fix places more in 
the town appeared in flames, whicji they occafioned 
by wild-fire, as the fitteft to burn their thatches, 
t onfifting of flags or rufhes ; and no fooner did the 
HJrrigtited creatures run out to fave their lives, but 
they were either driven back into the flames by the 
faiWrs, or killed without mercy. After the boatfwain 
h?d (lain two with his pole-ax, he threw a hand-gra- 
TxiAo into the houfe, which, foon burfting, made a 
ierribre havock, killing and wounding moft of them; 
and neither their king, nor any of his train, who 
-were in that houfe, efcaped their fury, but they were 
every creature /"mothered and burnt together. All this 



t ^7» } 
while they never fired a gun, left the people fliould 
waken fafter than they could overpower them. But 
they awaked faft enough, which obliged our i'clluws 
to keep together in bodies. And by this time the 
whole town was in a flame, yet their fury rather cn- 
creafed, calling out to one another to remember Tom 
yefftry. The terrible light of this conflagration made 
me very uncafy, and rouzed my nephew the captain, 
and the reft of his men, not knowing any thing of the 
matter. But when he perceived the dreadful fmoke 
afccnding in the clunds, and heard the guns go off, 
which made him conclude his men in danger, he takes 
another boat, and comes on Ihore himielf with 13 men 
well armed : Nor was he lefs furprifed to fee me and 
two men only in the boat ; but though I argued with 
him, as I did with his men^ about the danger of the 
voyaffc, the intereft of the merchants and ownerji, 
and tne fafetyof the fhip j yet my nephew was like 
the reft, declaring, that he woulcl rather lofe the fhip 
his voyage, his life and all, than his men fhould be 
Ipft for want of help ; and fo away he went. For 
my part, feeing him refolved to go, I had not power 
to ftay behind him : He ordered the pinnace back 
again for twelve men more ; and then we marched di- 
reAly as the flame guarded us. But furely never was 
fuch'a fcenc of horror beheld, nor more difmal cries 
heard before, except at the time of that vile traytor 
and ufurper Oliver Qromiveir^ taking Dfogheda in /rr- 
imd^ where he neither fparcd man, woman or child. 
The firft objeft, I think, we met with, was the 
ru-insof one of their habitations, before which lay 
four men and three women killed, and two burnt 
to death among the fire, which was now decaying. 
Nothing could appear more barbarous than this re- 
venge \ none more cruel than the authors of it. As 
we went on the iirc increafed, and the cry proceed- 
ed in proportion : Nor had we gone much farther, but 
we beheld three naked wpmen, followed by fixtecn 
or feventeeii mcn^ flying with the grcatcft fvviftnefs

from our men, who fhotoneof them in our fight : 
When they perceived us, whom thev fuppofed would 
be their murderers, they fct up a molt dreadful fhriek^ 
and two fwooncd away in tiie fright. Here was fuch 
a fijht, as might furely foftcn the hardeft heart ; and 
in pity, wc took means to let them know we would 
not hurt them j while tlie poor creatures, with bend- 
ed knees and lift up hunds, made piteous lanlenta- 
tions to us to fave their lives. I ordered our men not 
to hurt any of the poor creatures whatfoever ; but, 
being willing to underftand the occafion of all this, 
I went among thcfe unhappy wretches, who neither 
underftood me, nor I believe the meaning themfelves. 
Hereupon, being refohred to go into the middle of the 
tbwn through the fire, in order to put an end to 
diis barbarity, I orderixi the men to follow me ; but. 
I had fcarce fpoke the word before the boatfwain came 
lip, with four of our men At his heels, covered with, 
blood and duft, feoking ^iore people to maflacre j up- 
on which, calling out to them, we made them under- 
(land who we were, and they came up to us, (etting 
up a halloo of triumph, in token that more help 
was come. Noble captain, faid he to my nephew, I'm 
glad you're come-; we haye not half done with thefc 
villainous hell-hound dogs, we'll root out the very 
nation of them from the earth, and kill more than 
poor Tom has h^irs upon his head : And thus he went 
on till I interrupted him. Blood thirfty dog ! faid I,, 
will your cruelty never.cnd ? I charge you touch not. 
one creature more j flop your hands aiid ftand ftilJ, 
O.r you're a dead man thi? moment. Why, Sir, faid 
he, you neither know who you arc proteftii^, or what 
they have done ; but pray come hither, and bifhold an 
obj"ft of GPmpafHon^ ir fuch can merit your cle- 
mency ; and with that he fhewed me the poor fellow, 
wifh nis tUroat cut, hanging upoo th^j tree.

and Levi : Cittfed he their anger for it was fierce^ and 
their wrathy for it v)a% crueL But this fight made my 
nephew and the reft as bad as they ; nay, my nephew 
declared, hisconccrn was only for his men; as for 
the people, not a foul of them ought to live. Here- 
upon away ran the boatfwain and eight more to'iinifli 
the tragedy \ which being out of my power to pre* 
vent, I penfively returned back, both from the diimal 
fight, and the piteous cries of thofe unfortunate crea- 
tures, who were made vi£tim8 to their fury. Nor was 
it a lefs piece of folly in me to return to the boat with 
a few others, having narrowly efcaped forty armed //;« 
diansy who had bten* alarmed by the conflagration y 
but, having mi{I<HHhe places,, where they ftood, I got to 
the boat, accompanied with the fupercargo, and fo 
went on board, fendine the pinnace back again, to af« 
(ift the men in what migl\t happen. When I had got 
to the boat, the fire was almoft cxtineuifhed, and the 
noife abated \ but I had fcarce been half an hour on 
board the fhip, when I heard another volley given by 
our Tailors, and a. great fmoak, which* a& I- after- 
wards found, was our men falling upon thofe houfes 
and perfons that ftood between them and the fea \ but 
here they fpared the wives and. children, and killed 
9bout fixtcen or feventeen men. And fo they came 
ftrolling down to the pinnace, which, at that time 
was gotten on fhore to receive them. Not a man of 
them had received the leaft hurt, except two, one of 
whom drained his foot, and the other burnt bi^ hand 
a little, having met with no rufiftance, the poor /n- 
ii^ms being unprepared, amazed and confounded. 

Inded 1 was extremely angry with every one of 
them, but particularly the- captain \ who, mftead of 
cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them on 
to farther mifchief : Nor could he make any other ex- 
cufc, but that, as he was a man, he could not maftei 
his paf&ons, at the fight of one of his men fo cruel^ 
ly murdered. As for the reft, knowing they were not 

under 



I ^74 T 
under my command, they took no notice of my afi« 
gcr, but rather bodied of their revenge ; and, ac* 
cording to all their accounts, they killed or dcftroyed 
^bput 150 men, women and children, befides burn- 
ing the town to ufhcs. They took their compa-» 
nion Tern y^ffiry from the tree, covered him With 
(bme of the ruins, and fo left him. But, however 
juflifiable this a£):ion of our men might feem to them- 
ieWes, yet I always openly condemned it, with the 
appellation of theirafiacre of Madagafcar: For thougb 
they had (lain this Jiffifry^ yet he was certainly the firfl: 
iBggrcflbr^ by attempting to violate the chaftity of a 
young innocent woman, who ventured down to them 
cm the faith of the public capitulation, which wa$ fo 
treacfaeroufly -broken. 

We were now under fail, when the boatfwaiA 
would dticnd this bloody a£tion, by faying, Thatthc 
Indians had broke the truce, the night bdToie, by 
ibooting one ofourmen without yzSt provocation: 
^nd what if the poor fellow had takei> a little liberty 
TTnh ttK» wench, he ought not t^r itttw been siuidcTCd 
in fo villainous a manner ; and that they had ^&xi 
nothing but what the divine laws commiifioned to be 
-ionc to fuch homicides. However, I was in thctfamc 
mind as before, telling them that they were murder- 
ers, and bid him depend upon it, that God would blaft 
their voyage for fo unptirralleled a piece of barbarity. 

When we came into the gulph of Perfta^ five nf our 
men, who ventured on (bore, were either killed, or 
made flaves by the Jraliansy the reft of them' having 
fcarce time to efcape to their -boat. This made nfic 
upbraid them afreih with the juft retribution of hca- 
-vvn for fuch aftions : Upon which the boatfwain xc- 
ry warmly aflced me, wether thofe men en whom the 
tower of Siham fell, where greater finners than the 
Ttikoi xht Galileans ? And beiidcs, Sir, faid he, none 
of thefc five poor men that are loft, were with ms at 
the maffac.re of Madagascar ^ as you call it, and thcro

fore your repreheiifion is very unjuft, and your appli- 
cation improperly applied. Bcfides, added he, you ar^ 
contuiually ufingthc men very ill u|x>n this account, 
and being out a paflenger yourfclf, we arc not obliged 
to bear it ; nor can we tell what ill dcfi^ns you may 
have to bring us to judgment for it in England i and 
therefore if you don't leave this difcourfe, and not 
concern yourfclf with any of our affairs, I will leave 
the fhip;' and not fail in fuch dangerous company. 

All this I heard very patiently, till at length 1 told 
him what concern I had on board was none of his 
bufmefs -, that, however, I was a confidcrablc owner 
of the (hip, and therefore had a right to fpcak in coni« 
mon, and that) was no way accountable to him, nor 
to any body clfe. Well, this paft on, and I thought 
all had buen over. At this time we were in the road 
of Bengal \ where, going oniliorewith the fupercar^ 
go one day, in the evening, as I was preparing to 
go on board, one of the min came to me, afid told 
me, I need not trouble myfelf to come to the boat, 
for that the cockfwain and others had ordered him not 
to carry me on board any more. This infolent mei^ 
fagc much furprizcd me, yet I gave him no anfwer to 
it, but went diretflJy, and acquainted the fupcrcargo, 
entreating him to go on board, and, by acquainting 
the captain with it^ prevent the mutiny which I per- 
ceived would happen. But, before I had fpoke this, 
the matter was cfFccled on board : For, no fooner was 
I gone off in the boat, but the boatfwain, gunner, 
carpenter, and all the inferior officers, came to the 
quarter-deck, defxring to fpeak with the captain ; and 
there it was the boatAvain made a long harangue, ex- 
claiming againft me as before-mentioned i that if I had 
not gone peaceably for my own diverfion, they would 
have compelk'd me by violence for their fatisfattion ; 
that, as they had (hipped with the captain, fo they 
would faithfully ferve him \ but, if I did not quit the 
ihip, or the captain oblige me to it^ they would leave 

tho 



t 276 3 
the (hip immediately : Hereupon, turning his face 
about by way of fignal, they all cried out. One and 
All, One and All. 

You may be fure, that though my nephew wa« a 
man of great courage, yet he could not but be lur- 
prifed at their fudden and unexpected behaviour : And, 
. though he talked ftoutly to them, and afterwards ex- 
populated with them, that, in common juftice to mc, 
who was a confiderable owner in the fhip, they could 
not turn me as it were out of my own houfe, which 
mtght bring their lives in danger fhould they ever be 
taken in England: Nay, though he invited the boat- 
fwain on fhore to accommodate matters with me, yet 
all this, I fay, fignified nothing : they would have 
nothing to do with me ; and they were refolved to go 
on fhore if I came on board. Well, faid my nephew, 
if you are fo refolved, permit me to talk with him, 
and then I have done : And fo he came to me, giving 
me an account of their refolution, how one and all 
defigned to forfake the fhip if I came on beard, for 
which he was mightily concerned. I am very glad to 
fee you, nephew, faid- 1, and rejoice it is no worfe, 
fmce they have not rebelled againft you : I only de- 
fire you to fend my neceflary jthings on fhore, \\ ith 
a fufficient fum of money, and I will find my way to 
England as well as I can. Though this grieved my 
nephew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but 
compliance ; and, in fhort, goin^ on board, all my 
necefl'aries were fent me, and fo this matter was over 
in a few hours. 

I think I was now near a thoufand leagues farther 
off England by fea, than at my little kingdom, except 
this difference, that I might travel by land over the 
Great AfoguPs country to Suratt^ from thence up to 
Bafora by fea up the Perfian gulph, then take the way 
of the caravans over the Arabian defert to Aleppo and 
Scandaroon^ there take fh ipping to Italy ^ and lo travel 
by land into France^ and from thence crofs the fea to 
England* My 



( 2/7 ] 
hiy nephew left me two perfons to attend mc» one 
Of them washisfervant, and the other, clerk to the 
purfcr, who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings in. 
an Englijh woman\ houfe, where fcveral French^ one 
EngUJhy and two Italian merchants refidcd. The 
handfoihe entertainment I met with here, occafioned 
me to ftay nine months, confidering what courfe I 
fliould take. I had fomc Englifly goods with me of 
great value, bcfidcs looo pieces of eight, and a let- 
ter of credit for more, if there was occafion. The 
foods I foon difpofed of to advantage, and bought 
ere feveral good diamonds, which I could cafily car- 
ry about me. One morning the Englijh 'merchant 
came to me, and, being very intimate together, coun-. ^ 
tryman, faid he, I have a projeA to communicate to 
you, which I hope will fuit to both our advantage. 
To be fliort. Sir, we are both in a remote part of the 
world from our country ; but yet in a place where 
men of biifinefs may get a great deal of money. Now 
if you will put a thoufand pounds to my thoufand pounds 
we will hire a (hip to our fatisfaftion \ you ihail be 
captain, I'll be merchant, and we'll go a trading 
voyage to China ; for whv fliould we lie ftill like 
drones, when all the world is in continual motion ?. 
This propofal foon got my confcnt, being very 
agreeable to my rambling genius ; and the more fo, 
bccaufe I looked upon my countryman to be a very 
fince'c perfon : It required fome time before wc could 
get a vcfTel to our minds, smd failors to man it ac- 
cordingly : At length, we got an Englijh mate, boat- 
fwain and gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and 3 Portu- 
gueze foremaft-mcn, and, for want of others, made 
fhift with Indian fcamen. From hence we firft failed 
toy/chin^ intheiflandofS//w^/r/7, and then to Siam^ 
where we bartered our wares for fome arrack and 
opium, the laft of which bore a great price among the . 
Chinefe: In a word, wc went up to Sujkan^ making a 
i^ery great vOyage \ and, after eight months time, I 

Z returned 



[ «78 I 
ffeiurned to Bengal^ verv well (adsfied with this ad- 
venture, having fiot only gotten a fiifficient Aim of 
money, but an infight of getting a great deal raore. 

I'be next voyage my friend propofed to me, was 
Co go among the fpice iflands, and brinR home a load 
of cloves from the Manillas^ or thereuouts >4flan9s 
belonging partly to ji^fl/ir, but yet places where dio 
Dutch trade very much. We were not long preparing 
for this voyage, which we made no lefs fuccefsfuldun 
the laft, touching at Pornto^ and ieveral other, places 
which I do not perfe^ly remember, returning home in 
about five months time. We foon fold our fpices, 
which were chiefly cloves, and fome nutmegs, to a 
Per/tan merchant, who carried them away for the 
gulph ; and in fliort, making five to one advantage, 
we were loaded witlj money. 

Not long after my friend and I had made up our 
accounts, |to our entire fatisfa6iion, there eame 
in a Dutch coafter from Batavia^ of above two hun- 
dred ton. All the men pretended themfelves fo ill^ 
that there were not hands fufficient to undertake avoy- 
age, and the captain being, forfooth, willing to go 
to Europe^ public notice was given that the fliip was 
to be fold. No fooner did this come to our ears, but | 
we bought the flup, paid the mailer, and took pof- i 
leffion. We wpuld alfo very willingly have entertained ' 
fome of the men ; but they, having received their fliare 
of the booty, were not to be found ; being; fled all tO- : 
gethe/j to Jgra^ the city of the great mogul's refi- I 
denc^ ; and from thence were to travel to Surate^ arid : 
fo by fea to the Perfian gylph. And i*ideed they had , 
reafoh to fly in this manner ; for the truth of it was, 
the pretended captain, was the gunner only, and not 
the commander \ that, having been a trading voyage, 
they were attacked on (hore by the Mallayam^ who . 
killed three men and the captain ; after vhofe death, | 
the other eleven men, running away with the fhip tb j 
the bay oi Bengal^ left the mate and five meli more j

on fhore, of whom you will hear in the fcqucl. 

Let thein come by the (hip hqw they will, we 
thought we bought it honeftly ; neither did wc fufpe*!^ 
any thins of the matter, when the man fhcwcd ub a 
bill of fale for the ihip (undoubtedly forged) tonne 
Emanuel Chjierjhwtn^ which name he went by. And 
fo, without any more to do, we picked up fonie Dutch 
and £»;/(/% feamen, refolving for another voyage for 
cloves among the Phillipim and Molucca iflands ^ and, 
in fhort, we continued thus five or fix years, trading 
from port to pcjrt with extraordinary fuccefs; and 
was now, in the' feventh and laft y<^r, going in the 
(hip with my pattner to Cbina^ dcngning to touch at 
-Siarn^ and buy lome rice by the wuy. But in thi«^ 
voyage, contrary winds beat us up and down for a 
conuderable time among the iilands in the ftraights of 
Mall^a ; and no fooncr were we clear of thei'c nigged 
feas, but we perceived our ihip had fprung a Icak^ 
which obliged us to put into the river Cftmhodia^ whidT 
lies northward of thegulph, and goes up to Slam. 

One day as I vras on ihore ftfrefhing myftlf, there 
comes 'an Englljhman to me, who was a gunner\s mate 
on board an Engtijh EaJi^India (hip, riding up the 
jriver, near the city ot Camiodi/r. Sir, faid he, you 
may wonder at my bufmefs, having never feen me ih 
your life ; .hut though I am a ftranger, I have fome* 
thing to'tell you that very nearly concerns you ^ and 
indeed, it is the imminent danger you are in has 
moved me to give you this timely notice. Danger ! 
faid I, what danger .' I know of none, exc^t my 
ihip being leaky, for which I dcfign to have her run 
a-ground to-morrow morning. Sir, faid he, I hope 
you'll be. better employed, when you fhall hear what 
I have to fay to you. You know the town of Cam'- 
bodi^ is about 15 leagues up this river ; and about three 
leagues on this fide, there He two Dutch^ and three 
^ Englijh fliips ; and would you venture here, without 
coufidcring what ftrength you had to engage them ? 
Z 2 I knew. 



I 28o ] 
I knew not what he meant by this diTcourfc ; and, 
turning fhoi t vipon^im^ Sir, faiJ I, I know no reafon 
I have to be afraid either of any Englijh or Dutch fhips \ 
I am no interloper, and what bufinefs have they then 
with me ? Well, Sir, faid the man, \i you do think 
yourfelf fecure, all I can fay is, you muft take your 
chance : However, I am very forry you are fo deaf to 
good advice \ but I afTure vou, if you don't put tp 
^a immediately, you will oe attacked by five long* 
boats full of men, hanged yourfelf for a pyrate, if you 
are taken, and the particulars examined afterwards. 
I thought, Sir, added he, I might have met with a 
better reception for fuch a lingular piece of fervicr. 
Sir, faid I, I never was ungrateful to any manj but 
pray explain ycurfelf, and I'll go on board this minute, 
whether the leak «be flopped or no. Why, Sir, faid 
he, to be (hort, becaufe time is prtcicus, the matter is 
this : You know well enough that you were with. the 
ihip at Sumatra^ where your captain was murdered by 
the Medlayans^ with three of hisfailors, and that either 
you, or fome who were on board you, ran away with 
the ihip; and are fmce turned pyrates at fea. * Now, 
Sir, this is the fum of what I had to fay j and I can 
pofitively affure you, that if you be taken, you will 
be executed without much ceremony ; for, undoubt- 
edly, you cannot but be fenfible what little law mer- 
chant- fhips fhew to pyrates, whenever they fall into 
their unmerciful hands. Sir, faid I, I thank you for 
your kind information, and though I am fure no man 
could come more honeflly by the fhip than I have 
done ; yet, fatisfied with your honcft intention, and 
knowing their defigns, I'll be upon my defence. Pri- 
thee, Sir, faid the man, don't talk of being upon your 
defence; the befl: that you can make, is to be out of 
danger ; and therefore, if you have any regard for 
your life, and the lives of your men, take the advan- 
tage, without fail, of putting out to fea at high water ; 
by which means, as you have a whole tide before you, 

you 



I a8i 1 
you wtfT be gone too far out of their reach before they, 
can come down ; and fo, by the tide ( not reckoning the 
iength)you will get two hours of them; and as they 
are only boats, confcquently they will not venture 
(cfpecially if the wind blows) to follow you far out 
to fea. 

I am mighty well fatisfied, faid I, in this particular^ 
and of your kmdneft, which merits my greateft cf- 
teem : Pray, Sir, what amends (hall I make you ? He 
replied, I know not what amends you are willing to 
make, bccaufe you may have fome aoubts of its ccr-. 
tainty ; but, to convince you of the truth of what I 
£iy, I have one offer to make unto you. On board 
one of the Englijh (hips, I have nineteen months pay 
iae to me > and this Dutchman thit is with me, ha«i j: 
months pay due to him, which, if you will make good 
to us, we will go along with you. And (bould you 
find nothing more in it,, why then wc will dffire no. 
more ; but when you are convinced that wc have I'avtrd 
the (hip, your life,, and the lives of the men, we. 
will leave tn.e reft to your gencroiity.. 

So rcafbnable did: tnis every way appear, as to ob- 
tain my immediate con lent, and fo wc went on board, 
immeaiately.. As foon as ^jye came on board;,. my pai t- 
ner calls joyfully out, That they had ftopp?d the leak l; 
Well; thanlc God, faid I,, but pray, let us wxMgh. an- 
chor immediately.. Weigh; ! faid he, what is the mean»^ 
ijig of this hurry ? Pray,, faid I, .ifk no queftions, but 
all hands to work without lofmg a moment's time: 
Upon which, the captain v/as called in great hafte, 
who ordered the anchor to be got up- immediately ;. 
and, though the tide was not quite down, yetbcing.af*. 
fiftedwith.a little land-»brecze, w.ci^ood our to, lea : 
And then, it was, that calling my pai-tnei: into the ca* 
bin^ I related the ftory at large,, whi^^h was confitm- 
ed, and more amplified by the twjorfien I bad brought 
en board'.. But i'carce bad! we finifh^d. our difcourfe 
upon this head* but a failor canle to the cabin-door, 
with a meflagc from. thecaptatn, thft^. w^ wiecp chafed;

by five floops full of armed men. Very well, faid 
I, it is plain now.there'is fomething. in it. And foy 

Jroing upon deck, I told the men there was a defign 
or fcizing the ihip, and confequently executing us 
for pyrates ; and diked them, whether they would 
faithfully ftand by us, and one another ? To which 
they unanimoufly replied, that they would fight for us 
to the laft drop of their blood. And when I afked the 
captain which way he thought beft for us to manage 
the battle ; Sir, (aid he, tl^ oitly method is to keep 
them off with our great (hot as long as we are able, 
and the<vbave recourfe to our^fmall arms ; and when 
both thefe'f^l us, then to . retire to clofe quartern, 
when perhapHhe enemy, wanting materials, can nei- 
ther break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. la 
the mean time, the gunner was ordered to bring two 
guns to bear fore and aft out of the fteera^, and to 
load them with mulket bullets and fmall pieces of old 
fi^on ; and thus, the deck being cleared, we were pre- 
pared for the engagement, ftill keeping out to fea. 
But yet the boats followed us with all the fail they 
could make ; and we could perceive the two foremoft 
were Englijhy which outfailed the reft by two leagues, 
and which we found would come up with us : Here- 
upon we fired a gun without ball, intimating that 
they ftiould bring too, and we put out a flag of truce, 
as afignal for parley ; but, finding them crouding af- 
ter us, till they came within a fhot, we took in our 
white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately fired 
at them with ball ; -and then we called to them with 
afpeaking trumpet, bidding them to keep off at their 
peril. 

But all this fignified nothing to them, who, depend-^ 
ing upon the ftrength that followed them, were refo- 
lutely bent for mifchief : Hereupon I ordered them to 
bring the fhip to, by which means, they lying upon 
our broad-fide, we let fjy at them at once, one of 
whom carried away the ftern of the hindermoA boat, 
and obliged them not only to take down their fail, but 
^ . made

.made them all run to the head of the boat to keep- her 
froni finking ; and fo (he layby, having enough of it ; 
and, in the mean time, we prepared to meet the fore* 
moft boat in the fame manner. But, while we were 
doing this^ one of the three hindermoll boats made up 
to the relief of that which was difablcd, and took the 
men out of her. Hereupon we called again to parley 
witlx them, bi|.t,. inftcad of an anfwcr, one of the 
boats came clofe under our ftern ; whereupon our gun- 
ner let fly his two chafe-guns, but miiHng, the men 
in the boat fhoutcd, and waving their caps, came on 
.with fury i but, to repair his fecming difgrace, fodn 
got ready ; and, firing the fecond time, this fhot, we 
could perceive, did a great deal of execution among 
the men ; but, taking no notice of it, we wore ihip 
again, Iwringing our quarter to bear upon them ; 
when^ firing three guns more, we found the boat a 
finking, and feveral men already in the fea. Here- 
upon, immediately manning our pinnanpe, I gave 
orders to fave fome of the men from drowning, and 
inftantly come on board, bccaufe the reft of their boats 
were approaching. They accordingly, did fo, and 
took up three of them, one of whom was almoft paft 
recovery ; and then, crouding all the fail we could, 
after our men came on board, we ftood out farther to 
fca, fo that the other three boats gave over their chafe, 
when they came up to the firfl two. And thus, deli- 
vered from imminent danger, we changed our courfe 
to the eaftward, quite out of the courfe of all £«- 
ropean fhips. 

being now at fea, and enquiring more particularly^of 
the two feamen the meaning of all this ; the Dutchman 
led us into the fecret of it at oiice^ He tokl us, That 
the fellow who fold us the fhip was an errant thief, 
who had run away with her ; that the captain was 
treacheroufly murdered on the coaft of Maltacay by 
the natives there, with three of his men ; that he, the 
Dutchman^ and four more, being obliged to have re- 
courfe to the wwds for their fafety^ at length efcaped

C «84 J 
by means of a Dutch fliip in its Way to ChinOy which 
had fent their boat on fliore for freib water : That, 
after this, he went to Batavia^ where two of the fea- 
men belonging to the (hip (who had defertcd the reft 
in their travels) arrived, and there gave an account, 
that the fellow, who ran away with the (hip, had 
fold her at Bengal to a fet of pyrates, who went a 
cruifing, and had already taken an Engtijh aiid two 
Dutch (hips richly laden. 

Now, though this was abfolutely falfe, yet con- 
cerning us direiSlly, my partner truly faid, that our 
<!eliverancc was to be eiteemed fo much the more, by 
reafon had we fallen into their hands, we could have 
expeAed nothing from them but imfnediate death, 
confidering our accufers would have been our judges : 
And therefore bis opinion was, to return direifUy to 
Bengal^ whe^, being^ known, we could prove how 
honeftly w/camc by the (hip, of whom we bought 
her, and jlie like ; and where we were fure of feme 
juftice, Tvi% to be hanged firft,. and judged afterwards. 
And indeed I was at firft of my partner's opinion;, 
but when I had more ferioufty conndcred of the mat- 
ter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in attempting: 
to return thither, beine on the wrong fide of the 
ftraits of Malacca 'y and if, upon akrm given,., we 
fliould be taken by the Dtdch of Bata^ios^ or Englijh* 
elfewhere, our running away would be a fuflicient evi- 
dence to condemn ourfclyes. This danger indeed 
ftartled not only my partner, but all the ^ip's com- 
pany ; and fo we changed our former refolutioato go. 
to the coaft of Ton^u'iriy and fo tothatof CM^a^ whtrc^ 
purfuing our firft defign as to trade, we might dif- 
pofe of tbefhip fome \ .ly or other, and return in one 
of the country ycffels^ riiis being gouierally agreed 
to, we fteered away N. N. E, above 50^ leagues off 
the ufual courfe to the caft, which put u3 to k>mc inr 
conveniences, as thje winds blowing more fteadily

vifion ; and, what was ftUl worfe, we apprehended 
thofc (hips, from whofc boats wc had cfcaped^ being 
bound for, and got toChina before us, might have given 
frefli^information, which might create another vi- 
gorous purfuit. And laiUy, when I confidercd I had 
never wronged or defrauded any perfon in mj^ life, to 
be now purfued like a common thief, and, if taken, 
to be executed as fuch, according to what they fhould 
alledge ; this thing grieved me to the higheft degree 
(as it muft all innocent men) and confequently made 
me moredefirous of efcaping from its infamous fhamc, 
than from death itfelf. It was very taf)r to read a fad 
dejeiftion in my countenance upon tliis occaflon : 
My mind was oppreftlike thofe unhappy innocent per- 
fons, who, being overpowered by blafphemous and 
perjured evidences, wickedly refolved to take away 
their lives, or ruin their reputation, have no other 
recourfc, in this world, to eafe .their unfpeakabW 
forrow, but fighs, and prayers, and tears. My part** 
ner feeing me k> concerned, encouraged me as well as 
he could ; and, after defcribin^ to me the fcveral portt 
of that coaft, told me he would either put in on the 
coaft of Cochinchinay or clfc in the bay of Tcnquirtj 
and from thence go to Macao^ a town once pof- 
fciTed bv the Portugueze^ and where there ftill reiided 
many European families. 

Well, tothisplace we fleered our courfe, and ear- 
ly the next morning we came in fight ef the coaft. 
But^ confidering on our paft circumftances, we re* 
folved to put into a fmall river, whereby we could 
know, either over the land, or by the Ihip's pinnace, 
what vefibls were in any ports thereabouts : And in- 
deed this happy ftep was our certain deliverance; the 
next morning there came to the. bay of Tonquin two 
Dutch (hips, and a third without any colours ipread ;. 
and, in the evening, two Englijh (liips ftcered the 
fame courfe. The riverwhcrc wc were was but fmall, 
within a few leagues of its limits northward : The 
country was wild and barbarou^^ and the people all 

thieve^ 



t 286 } 

Ihieves, having no correfpondence with any other 
nation^ dealing only in fifb, oil, and Aich grofs 
commodities. One barbarous cuftom tl^ have, that 
when any veflcl is unhappily ihipwr«cked upon their 
coaft, they make the men their prlfpners or flaves ; 
fo that when we coafted north-eaft, to the point of 
land which opens to the great bay of Tdnqum, wc 
found ourfelves furrounded by enemies bodi by fa 
and land. 

As the fhip had been leakly before, we took the 
opportunity to cleanfe her in this place, and to flop 
up the places which let in the water And when we 
had lightened her, and brousfat our guns^ and other 
moveable things, to one fide, we eSayed to bring 
her down, that we mi^ht come at her bottom : But, 
upon fecond <;onfideraaon, we cared not to let her lie 
on dry ground ; neither indeed could wc find a con- 
Client place for it. The inh'abitants, not uied to fuck 
a fieht, as to fee a ihip lie down on one fide, and 
heel in towards (bore, neither perceiving her men who 
were at work on her bottom, with ftages and with 
boats on the ofF<-fide, they prefently imagined the 
fliip had been caft away, and fo lay fail on the ground. 
Agreeable to this fuppofition, they furrounded us with 
ten or twelve large boats, with a refolution, undoubt- 
edly, to plunder the (hip, and to carry away tho& 
they found alive, fof flaves to their kifig. But when 
they perceived our men hard at work upon the fbip*s 
bottom and fide, waihing, mving, and ftopping it, 
it filled them with fuch furpnze, that they ftood gaz-' 
ing as though they were confounded. Neither could we 
imagine what their defign was $ however, for fear 
of danger, we handed down arms and ammunition 
to tho^ at work, in order to defend themfelves 3 and 
indeed this precaution was abfolutely neceflTary j for, 
in a quarter of an hour after, the natives concluding 
it was really a (hipwreck, and that we were faving 
our lives and goods, which they thought belonged 
to themi came down to our men, as though it had been 

in 



.[ »87 ] 
In a line of battle. Indeed we lay but in a very un- 
fit poilure to fight i and, before the ftages could be 
got down, or the men in the boat come on board as 
thcv wer^ ordered, the Cochinefa were upon thcni^ . 
ana two of their boats boarding our long-boat, they 
began to lay hold of our men as prifoncrs. The firft 
they feized was a ftout EngEJh Tailor, who never fired 
his muflcet, like a fool, as I imagined, but laid it 
down in the boat ; but he knew vmat he was doing* 
for, by main force, he dragged the Pagan out^f the 
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains 
out affainft the boat's gunnel ; A Dutchman^ that was 
next nim, fnatches up the mufket, and knocked down 
five more with die but-end of it : However, this was 
doing very little to their number; but a ftrangc, un* 
expeeked accident, which rather merits laughter, than "* 
any thing elfe, gave our men a complete victory over 
them. 

It feems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave 
the outfide of the (hip, as well as to pay the (earns 
where he caulked her, to (lop the leaks, had gotten 
two kettles juft let down in the boat, one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rofin, tallow and 
oil, and fuch ftufFas the (hipwrights ufe : The car- 
penter's man had a great iron ladle, witli which he 
ufcd to fupply the workmen with hot ftufF^ and, as 
two of the enemies entered the boat where the fellow 
ftood, he faluted them with a ladlcful of the hot boil- 
ing liquor, that, being half naked, made them roar 
again, and jump into the fea. Well done, Juck^ fays 
the carpenter, give them t'other ciofe ; and fo, ftep- 
ping forward himfelf, takes a m<)p, and dipping it 
into the pitch-pot, he and his m<in flun^^ it fo plen- 
tifully among them, as none efcaped being fcaldcd : 
Upon which they all made the beft of their way, 
crying and howling in fuch a frightful manner, that 
in all my adventures I never heard the like before. 
And, indeed, never was I better plcafed with any con- 
queft than I was with thi:>» by rcafou there was fo

little bloodfhcd, having an averfion to killing fucKfa* 
vagc wretches (more than was neceflary) knowing 
they came on errands which their laws and cufioms 
made them think were Juft and equitable. By this 
time, all things being m order, and the fliip fwioi- 
ming, they found their miftake, fo they durft not ven- 
ture a fecond attack. Thus ended our merry fight ; 
and having got fome rice, bread, roots, and fixteen 
good hogs on board the day before, we iet fail, not 
daring to go into the bay of Tonquin^ bnt fleered N. E. 
towards the ifle oi Formofay as though wc would go to 
the ManillaSy or the Pbillippine ifiands, for fear of 
meeting with any European fhips. When we anchored 
at the ifle of Fcrmofay the inhabitants not only fup- 
plied us with provifions and frefh water, but dealt 
very £airly and honeftly with us in their bargains and 
agreements. From this place we fleered north, keep- 
ing ftill off the coaft of Cbinay till we were beyond all 
the ports where European vefTels ufually come; and at 
length, being come to the latitude of thirty decrees, 
we refolved to put into the firft trading port we fhould 
come at ; and ftanding for the ihore, a boat came off 
two leagues, to us, with an old Portuguexi pilot on 
board, who offering his fervice, we very gladly ac- 
cepted him, arid fent the boat back again. And now, 
having the old man on board, I talked to him of going 
to Nanquin^ the moft northward part of the coaft of 
China. What will you do there ? faid he, fmiling ; I 
told him we would icll our cargo, and purchaie calli- 
coes, raw and wrought filk, tea, &c.-and fo return the 
fame way back. O^ faid he, you had better put in at 
MacdOy where you may buy china wares as cheap as at 
Nanquln^ and fell your opium at a greater advance. 
But, faid I, we are gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and dcfign to fee the great city of Peking^ ?.nd the 
magnificent court of the Monarch of China. Why 
then, faid he, you fliould go to Ningpo^ where there 
is a navigable river that goes through the heart of 
that vaft empire, two hundred and feventy leagues 

from 



[ 289 ] 

' friofn the fea, which crofles all the rivers, pafles con- 

- liderable hills by the help of fluices and gates, and 
jgocs even up to the citjr of Pekin^ and you may go to 

' Nanquin^ if you pleafe, and travel to Pekin, there Is a 
Dutch (hip jirft before bound that way. At the name of 
m Dytch or Englijh fhip I was (truck with confufion, 
they being as great a terror to me in this vefTcly as an 

* Mgerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. 
The old man finding me troubled, Sir, faid he, I hope 
the Dutch are not now at war with your nation : 
No, faid I, but God knows what liberty they may 
take when out of the ruach of the law. Why,' fays 
he, what occafion is there for peaceable merchants to 
fear ? for, believe me, they never meddle with any 
but PYRATES. 

At theinentiopmg the word PyrateSy my counte* 
nance turned to'fcarlet, nor was it poffible for me to 
conceal itfrom the old pilot, who taking notice of it, 
StTy h\A he, take what cburfe you pleafe^ Vll do you all 
the firvUe I can. Signior, faid I, I am a little con- 
cerned at your mentioning Pyrates^ I hope there arc 
none in thcfe feas; becaufe you fee in what a weak 
condition we are to defend ourfelves. O Sir^ faid he, 
tfthat^s ally dovtt he concerned \ I don^t rerhember one in 
thefe parts tbefe fifteen yearsy except about a month agOy 
one was Jeen in the bay of Siam ; but Jhe it gone to the 

fouth ; nor was Jhe built for a privateer ^ but was run 
away with by a pyrate captain^ andfomeof his men^ the 
right captain having been murdered by the Mallayans. 

What, faid I,* (as though ignorant of 'what had 
happened) did they kill the captain ? No, faid he, 'tis 
thought the Mallayans murdered him, but perhaps 
•they might procure them to do it, and therefore de- 
ferved hanging. They were lately difcovered in the 
bayof 5/^7m, in the river of Gamboaiay by {omc Dutch^ 
men who belonged to the (hip, and had much ado to 
cfcape five boats that purfued them : But they have 
all given fuch an exa6t defcription of the (hip, that 
wherever they find her, they will be furc tbknow her; 
A a and 



f *90 J 
and they have folemnly iworn to give them no ijuarter, 
but to hang them every one at the yard arm^ without 
formally brindng tjiem to acpurtc^ iu0ice« 

Being fcnfible that, having the olg[ .mun on board, 
he could not do me any mifchiefy Well* Signjor, faid 
I, 'tis for this very reafon I would have you carry uft 
up to NanquiHj where neither EngUJh or. Dutch fnips 
come : And I muft tell you their captains are a par^ 
eel of raih, proud, infolent rafcals, that neither know 
what belongs to juftice, nor how to. bphave themfelircs 
as the laws of God and nature direjfl : Fellows that 
would prove murderers to punifli robbei:s ; smd take 
upon them to adjudge innocent men to deauh^* without 
any plain proof to confirm their guilty but pierhaps I 
may live to call them to account, in a pUce where 
they may learn how juftice (bould b^ executed.- An4 
fo I told him the ftory of buying the ihip ; and hoii^ 
WQ were favcd by the means of two men : That the 
murder of the captain by the M^U^yans^ as alfo the 
running away with theihip, I believed to be trtie \ but 
that we who bought it were turned pyrates^ was a 
mere fi&ion, to cover therr cowardice and fooliih be* 
haviour, when they attacked ns ; and the blood of thofe 
men we killed in our own jufl defence lay at their 
door,, who fent them to attack us by furprize. 

SiiKy iaid the old man amazed, you have taken the 
right jcourfe to /leer to the north i and^ if I might aihift 
youy I vfould have you fell your Jhip in China, and buj 
another in that country ; and Fll procure people to buj 
one and fell the other. Well, but Signior, faid I, u 
I Tell the fliip.4n xhis manner, I may bring fomc iii«. 
nocent perfons into the fame danger as I have gone. 
through, perhaps worfc, even death itfelf, whereby I 
Ihould be as guilty of their murder as their villainous ; 
per(ccutors>. That need not trouble youy faid -the old \ 
man, Fll find a way to prevent that: For thofe com" 1 
rnamUrs you talk ofy I know very well, and I wiu inform

iage from me to them ? YVi^faid he, if you will givi it 
UMir your hani^thaiJmaf proveitis not my own in- 
ViuttM. Hereupon I wrote a large account of their 
attacking me in their long-boats, the pretended rea- 
fon and unjuft defign of it ; that they had done what 
they ought to be afhamed of, and could not anfwer, at 
any tribunal in England. But this letter was written 
in vaini providence ordering things another wav. Wc 
failed diredtly for Nanquin^ and in about 13 aays fail 
came to an anchor at the ibuth-weft point of the 
great gulph of that place, where we learned, that 
twoZ/vf^ifrfllips were^onethe length before us, and 
that we fhoiila certainly fall into their hands. We 
were at a great lofs in this exigency, and would very 
gladly have been on (bore almoft any where : But our 
old pilot told me, that if I would fail to the fouthward 
about 42 leagues, there was a little port called ^in- 
change where no European fhips ever came, and where 
we might confidcr what was farther to be done. Ac- 
cordingly we weighed anchor the next day, calling 
only twice on Ihore by the way to get frefiv water. 
The country people vtry courtcouAy fold us roots, 
tea^ rice, fowls, and other provifion. After five 
days fail, we came to the pert, and landed with un« 
fpeakabie joy. We refolvcd to difpofe of ourfelves 
and effeAs any way poflible, rather than go -on board 
that ill-fated veflel again. For no ftate can be more 
milcrable than a continual fear, which is a life of 
death, and a confounder of our underftandin^, that 
lets the inmsinationat work to form a thoudina fright- 
ful things that may never happen. And indeed both 
my partner and I fcarce flept a ni^ht without dream- 
ing of halters, yard-arms, &c. ot fighting and being 
taSen, killing and being killed, nay, fo violent were 
our appreheniions, that we would bruifc our hands 
and heads againft the cabin, as though actually en- 
gaged. The ftory of the Dutch cruelty at Jmloyna 
ofiet^ came into our waking thoughts ^and^ for my

But now^ th^ks to kind Heaven, being . s^orr, 
our old pilot procured a lodging and a warehoufe : 
It was a little hut^ with a lar^e warehoufe adjoining, 
all built with canes, and palli^doed round with large 
ones, to keep out the pilfering thieves, which are 
very nuoierous in that country : But the magifirates 
allowed us a little guard, befides we employed a cen* 
try with a kind of halbert, iQt three-peace a day. 
The fair or mart had been over iome time ; howisvcr 
there remained in the river four ^ junks and two Jo- 
pantti\^y the merchants of the Utter being alhofc. 
In the firft place, our old pilot brought us acquainted 
with three Romijh miflionaries, who were converting 
the Chinefe to Chriftianity j two of them were relerv- 
ed,rigid and aufterc, applying themfelves tp the work 
they came about with great earneftneis j but the third, 
a Frenchman^ called Father Simon^ was of a freer con«. 
verfation, yet not a worfe Chriftian than the other 
two, one of whom was a Portuguezey and the other 
zdmcefe: But Father S/>»«;7, it ieems^ Was appointed 
to go to Pekin^ the refidence of the Emperor*of 
0)inaj and on Iv waited for another prieft, who was 
ordered from Macoa to accompany him. We fcarce 
met, but he was prompting me to go with him ; Sir, 
laid he, Iwill fbew you the glorious things of this 

mighty 



mighty Empire, and -a tity, the city of Pektn, far ex- 
ceeding Lmdm or pMris^ put them both togethi r. 
One oay particularly, being at dinner with him, 1 
fliewed fome inclination to go, which made him prc^s 
me the more, and my partner alfo, to gain our con* 
fent : But father, faid my partner,^ what fatisfadion 
can you have in our company, when you efteem us 
heretics, confequently objects not wortti your regard ? 
Oh^ faid he, you may be as good Catholics in time, 
as thofe I hope to convert. And fo, faid he, we (kail 
have you preaching to us all the way, inftead of 
pleafing us with a defcription of the country. Sir, 
faid he, however our relieion may be vilified, tis very 
certain it neither divefts us of good manners or 
ChriiKan charitv ; and as we are gentlemen, as fuch 
we nuiy converfe, without making one another un- 
cafy. 

But, to leave him awhile, let us condder our fh!p 
•and merchandize, that we had to difpofe of. There 
was but little bufinefs in the place where wc were ; 
and once I was refolved to venture to fail to the river 
Kilaniy and fo to the city of Nanquln \ but Providence 
ordered it otherwife, by our old pilot's bringing a Jew 
merchant to us, to fee what goods we had. He im- 
mediately bought our opium, for which he gave us "a 
ytTv good price in gold by weight, fome wedges of 
which weighed above lo or ii ounces. It came 
into my head, that he might buy the fhip too ; and I 
orderea his interpreter to propofe it to him. He faid 
nothing then, but fhrunk up his fhoulder^ ; yet in 
a few days after he came, accompanied by a mimonary 
priefl, who was his interpreter, with this propofal, 
that as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, 
be had not money enough to purchafc our (hip ; but, 
if I pleafed, he would hire her, with all my men, to 
go to Jatan^ and fend them with another loading to 
the Philippine \{\zni?^y Xht, freight of which he would 
willingly, pay to us before.; and at • their return to

Japan^ wouU buy the fbip. ITpon Cfais \7e aikd 
the captain and his meni if thcj were willing to go 
'to Japan ; to which they unaoimoufly agreed. WhUe 
this was in agitation, the young man whom my 
nephew left to attend me, told me, that as I did not 
care to accept this profpedi of advantage, he would 
manage it for me as I pleafed, and render me a faith* 
ful account of his fuccefs, which fliould be whotiv 
mine^ Indeed I was very unwilling to part witn 
him ; but, as it might turn to his advantage, I dif- 
courfedmy partner about it, who,' of his own acconi, 
gave him his fhare of the vellel, fo that I could not 
do otherwife than give him mine ; but, however, wq 
let him have but the property of half of it,aod preferved 
a power, that when we met in England^ lif he had 
obtained fuccefs, he fhould account to us for one haLF 
of the profits of the (hip's freight, and the other 
fhould be his own; Thus having taken' a writing 
under his hand, awavhe failed to japam^ where the 
merchant dealt honeftly by him, got him a licence 
to go on ihore, fent him loaded to the Philipplnis 
with their fupercargo, came back again with Europeat 
goods, cloves, and other fpice ; and, in fhort, he got 
a great deal of money ; nor would he fell his fhip, 
but traded on his own account, went back to the 
Manillas^ where getting acquaintance he made his 
fhip free, was then hired by the governor to go to 
Acapulco in Ameri^^ on the Mexican coaft, with a 
licence to travel to ^hat great city j and this gained 
him immenfe treafute, and finding means to get ta 
Jamaica^ he returned nine years after exceeding rich 
io Erigland. 

In parting with the fhip it comes in courfe to con- 
fider thofe men who faved our lives in the river of 
Cambodia: And though, by the way, they were a 
couple of rogues, who thought to turn pyrates them- 
fclves : yet we paid them what they at firft demanded, 
and gave each a (inall fum of^ phoney, making the

with which they were very well contented. 

Wi were now above xooo leagues farther from 
home, than when at BmgaL AU the comfort we 
could expe£l was, that there being another fair in a 
month's time, we might not only purchafe all forts of 
the country manufacShires, but very poflibly find fome 
Clnniji junks or vefiels from Tmquin^ to be fold, 
which would carry us and our goods wherever we 
pleafed. Upon thefe hopes, we refolved to continue ; 
afid to divert ourfelves, took feveral little joumies into 
the country. Ten days we travelled to fee the city 
of Nanquitij about lat. ^o. N. which is regularly 
built, the ftreets exaAly ftrait, croiling each other ill 
diredl lines, which makes it fhew to great advantage. 
At our return, we found the prieft was come from 
Maaa that was to go with Father Simon to Pekin. 
That Father earneftly folicited me to accompany him, 
and I referred him to my partner. In fliort we both 
agreed to it, and prepared accordingly. Nor did we 
fail meeting with great advantage, as to finding the 
way, having the liberty to travail among the retinue 
of a Mandarin, who is a principal magiftrate, and 
much reverenced by the people. 

We were aj; days travelling through this mlferablc 
country, infinitely populous, but as mdifFerentlycul-* 
tivated } but their pride is infinhsly greater than their 
poverty, infomuch that even their prieih deride them* 
As we pafled the houfe of one of their countrv gen- 
tlemen, two leagues offNanquinj we had the nonouf 
to ride with theC/bin^ fquire about two miles. Ne- 
ver wasDon ^ixote fo exaAly imitated, never fuch 
a compound of pomp an& poverty feen before. 

His habit, made of cdlico, was dirty, greafy, and 
very proper for a Merry Andrtw^ with all its tawdry 
trappings, as 'hanging*fleeves, taflels, &c. but torn 
in every part : His velr underneath it was no cleaner, 
but more greafy*. His borip (wopfe than Rofimmte

ortheramous fteed of the doughty flu£brafs) was a 
pv)or, ftarved, decrepid thing, that would not Tell for 
thirty (hillings in £>f^/0n^: And yet aftef- this piece 
ot beggarly pomp attended ten or twelve flaves, 
guarding him to his countr)' feat. We ftopt at a lit- 
tle village for refrefhment ; and when we came by 
the country feat of this great man, we found him fit<- 
tine under ii.tree before his door, eating a mefs of 
boiled rice, with a great piece'of garlick in it, and a 
bag filled, with green pepper by him, and another 
plant like ginger, with a bit of lean mutton, all tbt^ 
put together was his worfhip's repaft : But pray ob- 
serve the floth and ftate of the fool ! Two women 
ilaves brought his food ; which being laid before him, 
two others appeared to perform their refpeftive offices ; 
one fed him with a fpoon, while the other fcraped off 
what fell upon his beard and veft, and gave it to a par- 
ticular fovourite to eat. And thus we left the wretch, 
pleafed with the conceit of our admiring bis magnifi- 
cence, which rather raifed our fcorn and deteftation. 

At laft we arrived at the great city of PMttj accom- 
panied by two fervants, and the old P§irtuguezt pilot, 
\thofe charges we bore, and who was our interpreter. 
We had fcarce been a week at Pekiny but he comes 
laughing to us. Ah, Signior Inglife, faid he, mefome- 
ting tellj you make your heart glad, but make me 
forry, for you bring me here, 25 days journey, and 
now you leave me, go back alone i and which fhall I 
make my port after, widout the fhip, widout de horfe, 
widout pecune, fo he called money in his broken lan- 
guage. But, in fhort, that there was a great caravan 
of Mufrovite and Poltfl> merchants in the city, who 
were preparing tofet out for Mufcovy by land within 
fix ^eeks ; and that he was certain we would take 
this opportunity, and confequently that he muft go 
home by himfelf. Indeed this news pleafed us much : 
Are you certain of this,faid I ? Yes,Sir,faid he, me fure 
true* Then he told me^ tliat having met an old ac- 
quaintance 



[ a97 ]' 
Tt^uauieuice, an Armmian^ who wat imong them, and 
came laft from jMracgn^ with a defign to so to Ten* 
fUiMf where he formerly knew him ^ but haviiig al* 
t^»d faia reiblttdont waa refotved to go with the cara- 
Vkn to AAlcnt^ askd fo down the river ff^fg^ to j/f^ 
traum. Well, Signor, faid I, don't be difcontented 
about TOur. returning alone ; for, if by thia means I 
can fina a paflage to England^ it will be your own 
fault if you return to AiacM at all. Ana fo, con- 
^fulting with my partner what was beft to be done, he 
referred it to me as I pleafed, our affairs being fo vrell 
fettled .at ;&«|^/, that if we could vend the China 
filka ve had purchafed, he would confent to 
£0 to Engkmd^ and fo return to Bmgel in the 
company's ihips. And thus we refolved, that if our 
pilot would Ro with us, we would bear his chars;es to 
Mkfiuw or England^ and give him 1.70/. fterl. Here- 
upon we calldi him, and told him.. the caufe of hia 
coosplaint ihould be removed. If he -would accompa- 
wf ua with the caravan, and therefore dcfired to know 
hia nuod. A« this he (hook hia head, ffnat Img 
jnertuf.^ faid he, mt no ptcune^ carry nu Molcow, knp 
m iiTi* But we foon difpelled his concern, by telt- 
ing him what we would five him here to lay out 
to the beft advantage ; and, as for his charges, we 
would pay them to Mofcow or to England^ which he 
ploafad, except the carriage of his goods* At this' 
propofal he was quite tranfported, faying, he would 
go with us all the world over. We then prepared for 
opj journey : But,, I think, it was near four months - 
bcrare all the merchants were ready. 

In the 'mean time, my partner and the pilot went 
exprefs to the port were we firft putin, to fell what- 
goods were left there, while I accompanied a Chifiefi^ 
n^erchant to Nanquitiy and there bought 29 pieces of 
damafk, with about 300 more of other fine filks; 
and by the time my partner returned to Pekittj I had 
them all earned thither ; fo that oCu- cargo amounted 
in goods only to about 4500/. fterling, which, to*.

fitthcr with tea, fine callicoes, nutmegs and cloveii 
KMded 18 camels for our (hare, befidcs what we rode 
upon, with two or three fpare horfes, and .two more 
loaded with provifion. And indeed the company in 
general was very great, making about 400 hoke, and 
above 120 men, vml armed and j>r0vided. We weft 
of feveral nations, among the reft were five S€9is mer- 
chants livin^at Mo/cow^ well experienced in bufineft. 

We left Fiiin i^is beginning of Fthrumrjy O. S. 
and in two days wc pa fled through the jgate ofthe great 
CA/V/^iwall, which was built as a fortification agaunft 
the Tartars^ being 100 miles long. We then entered 
a cobiitry not near fo populous, chiefly under the 
power ot plundering Tartars^ feveral companies of 
whom we perceived^ on poor^rved horfes, contemp- 
tible as thcmfelves, without order or difcipline. One 
time our leader for the day permitted us to hunt. 
But what do you think we nunted ? only a parcel of 
(heep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for 
wildnefs and fwiftnefs ; but while we were purfuing 
this game, we met above forty Tw inrSj who no 
focner percei,ved us, but one of them blew a horn, at 
which there immediately appeared above forty or fifty 
more, at about a mile diftant. Hereupon one of the 
Scots merchants ( who knew their curled ways ) or- 
dered us to advance towards them, and attack them 
. immediatel^r. As we advanced they let fly a volli^of 
arrows, which happily fell a little mort of us: This 
made us halt a little, toreturr the compliment with 
bullets. Ai^d then it was, led up by the bold &«/, 
that we fired our piftols in their faces, and drew our 
fwords ; but there was no occaTion, for they flew 
like timorous fiieep, and only three of them remained, 
beckoning the reft to come up to them. But our 
brave leader galloped up to them, fhot one dead, 
knocked another off his horfe, while the third ran 
away : And thus ended our battle with the Tartars. 

Weftill travelled a month more through the Emperor 
of China % dominions \ and at length coming to one

. of their towiia (tbout a day and a halfs journey 
from the cicy of Nawn) I wanted to buy a camel : 
And'the peribn I fpoke to would have brought mc 
one, but like a fool I muft go along with him, which 
was about two miles from the villaee. My old pilot 
aiidl walked on foot, foffooth, for fome variety ; 
when cortiing to the place, where the camels were 
kept as in a park (guarded by Chinije foldicrs) we there 
agreed and bought one, which tne Chinefe man that 
€ame with me led along the mad. But we had not 
gone far before we were attacked by five Tartars^ 
mounted on horfeback) two of whom ftized the 

- man, todc the camel from hini, and rode away ; but 

. the.other three approached us, the firft of which fud- 
denly feizing me as I was drawing my fword, the fe- 
cona knocked me down, and ftunned me \ but my old 
tru% P$rtugui%e^ taking a piftol out of his pocket, 
which I knew nothing of, and'cbming up to the fel- 
low that ftruck me, laid hold of him with one hand, 
pulling him off his horfe, and then (hot him dead upon 
the fpot : Then taking his fcymetar, he ftruck at 
the man that ftopt us, but miffing him, cut off one 
of his horfe's ears, 'the pain of which made him thn)w 

• his rider to the ground^ with himfelf upon him. 

. The poor Chinefiy who had led the camel, feeing the 

Tartar doWn, runs to him, and feizing iipOn his pole- 

^e, wrenched it fi;om his hands, and knocked out his 

brains. But there was another Tartar to deal with, 

who feeming neither to fight nor fly, my old man be- ; 

. gan to charge his piftol^ the very fight of which 

RTuck fuch a terror in the wretch, that he fcowcr^d 

. away,, leaving my old pilot, rather my champioii and 

defender, an abfolute vidory. 

It was by this time, being awakened from my deep, 
as I thougnt, I began to open my cye!5, wondering 

. where I was, quite forgetting all tnat was p.ift : But 
when my fenfes returned, feeling a great pain in my 
head, while the blood was running over my cloaths, 
I iuftantly jumped upon my feet grafping niy fworJ 

in 



[30^ 1 
ia my hand, wftH a refolution to take revtnge ; yd 
no enemies appeared, except the dead Tartar^ with 
his horfe ftanding by him ; but the old man feeing 
me recovered, whom he thought flain, ran towards me, 
and embraced me with the greateft tendemefs, at the 
fame time examining into my wound $ but being fer 
from every body, we returned to the village, when 
the man demanool payment for his camel, which I 
refuHng, we brought tne cauie before a Cbiw/t judge, 
who aded with great impartiality. Having hcvd 
both fides, he afketl the Cbittr/i man that went with 
me, whofe fervant he was ? Sir, fiud he, I am no- 
body's, but went with the ftranger, at his requeft: 
Why then, faid the judge, you were the ftranger's 
fervant for the time, and the camel being delivered 
to his fervant is the (ame as being delivered to him- 
felf, and accordingly he muft pay for it« Indeed the 
cafe was fo fairly ftated, that I had nothino; to oljed 
to it, fo, having paid for what I was robbed of, I fent 
for another, but did not go myfelf to fetch it, for I 
had enough of that fport before. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe em- 
pire, fo fortified, as fome tell you, that millions of 
Tartars cannot batter down the walls ; by which 
certainly one might think one of our cannons would 
do more execution than all their legions. 

But the Governor of that city, as we were within 
a day's march of it, having fent meflengers to every 
part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans 
to halt till he had lent a guard to proteft them from 
the numerous bodies of Tartan that lately appeared 
about the city ; this news put us into great confter- 
nation, but, obeying the orders; within two days 
there came 200 foldiers from a Chinefe garrifon, and 
300 more from Naum : Thus, being guarded both in 
the front and rear, with our own men on the fides, 
we advanced boldly, thinking we were able to combat 
10,000 Mogul Tartars^ if they had appeared^ but were 
forced to tell another ftory next day,.

f«r early next morning, marching from a little well* 
iituated town called Cbangu^ after having paflcd a 
siver, and entered upon a defert of above fifteen or 
fix teen miles over, we foon behold, by a cloud of 
duft that was raifed, that the enemy was approaching 
towards us. This ficht much difpiritcd the Chinfff^ 
which appeared (b plainly, that mj old pilot took 
notice of it, and called out, Signior h^lffs^ thcfe 
fellows muft be encouraged, or they will ruin usalU 
and I'm afraid, if the Tirr^rj atuck us, they will all 
run away. Why, Signior, faid I, what Ihall be ilonc 
in this cafe f Done, fays he, why let fifty of our 
men advance, and then flanking on each wing, en- 
courage them^ for I know they will fight well enough 
in company. Accordingly we took his advice, 
marching fiftv to the right wing, and the fame num- 
ber to the left, and the reft made a line of referve, 
leaving the laft 200 men to guard the camelS| or to 
affift us as occafion r^uired. 

Thus prepared, a party of them came forward, 
viewing our pofture, and traverfing the ground on the 
front of our line .* Hereupon we ordered the two 
wings to fire, and each of them to give a falvo with 
their (hot^ which accordingly was done. And this in- 
deed put a ftop to their proceeding ; for foon after 
wheeling off to their left, and undoubtedly giving an 
account to their companions w^at reception they 
snight expeft, they gave over their entcrprize. 

When we came to the city of Nawtt^ we rcturcd 
the governor hearty thanks, and gave 100 crowns 
among the foldiers that guarded us. We refted there 
l>ut one day, and then proceeded on our travels, 
pafling feveral great rivers and deferts, till, on the 
1 3th of Jpril^ we came to the frontiers of Mufcuvy^ 
the firft town of which was called Argun. 

This happy event, as I thought it, of coming into 

a chriftian Country, made me congratulate the &c9ts 

merchant upon it : He fmiled at that, telling me, not 

to rejoice toof^oni for, £ud be, except the RuJJutn 

B b foldiers 



X 30^2 1 
ibldiers in nrrifbn, and a few inhabi^ttits -of th^ 
cities upon £e road, all the refl of this countiy for 
above a choufand miles, is inhabited by the mon ig« 
no rant and barbarous Pagans. 

We advanced from the river Jrgun by moderale 
journeys; and found convenient garriibnsin the land 
filled with Chriftian foldiers, for the fecurity of com.- 
merce, and for the convenient lodgiag of travellers ( 
but the inhabitants of the country were mere Pagans 
worihipping the fun, moon and ftars. And this 
idolatry we met near Argun^ at a city of the Tartars 
and Rujfians joined together, caHed Ntr^nkey : F<ff 
being curious to fee their way x)f ' living, whik the 
caravan continued to reft themfelves in that city, I 
went to one of their villages, when there was to be 
one of their folemn facrmces. Tkere behold upo« 
the ftump of an old tree, was {rfacod an idol qf woodf 
more ugly than the reprefeatation of the tievil him- 
felf ; its nead was fuch as refemhied no living crear 
ture ; its ears were as big "and Tiigh as goats haras, 
a crooked nofe, four-cornered niouth,, aod horrible 
teeth : it was cloathed in flieep-ikins, -had a gseat 
T^^r bonnet, with two horns growing through it, aind 
was eight foot hi^h, without feet, legs or propor- 
tion. Before this idol, there lay i^ or 17 people^ 
who brought their ofFerings, and were making their 
prayers ; while at a diflance flood three .tnen and one 
bullock, as viAims to their ugly monfter. 

Such ftupendous facrilege as this, in robbing the 
true God of his honour, nlled me with the greatefi 
aftoniihment and refledion } which foon turning to 
rage and fury, I rode up to to the image, and cut^D 
pieces the bonnet that was upon his haul with mj - 
fword, fo that it hung down by one of the horns; 
while one of my men that was with me, pulled at it 
by its fheep-fkin garment : But immediately an hi- 
deous howling and outcry ran through the village, and 
two or thre6 hundred people coming about our ears, 
we were obliged to fly for it. 

But 



[ 3^3 1 
But I had not done with the monfter ; for the ca- 
nvan being to reft three nights in the town, I told 
die Scits merchant what I had feen, and I was re-* 
folved to take four or five men well armed with me, 
in order to deftroy the idol, and (hew the people how 
ttttTe reafon they had to truft to it, who could not 
bve itfelf. At-firft he laughed at me, reprefenting 
the danger of it ; and when it was deftroycd, what 
lime haa we to preach to them better things, whole 
seal and ignorance were in the higheft degree, and 
both unpanJelled ; that if I fhouid be talccji by them, 
I ihould be ferved like a poor Ruffian^ who contemned 
their worfhip j that is, be ftrippcd naked, and tied to 
the top of the idol, there ihbt at with nrrows till 
my body was full of them, and then burnt as a fa- 
crifice to the monfter : But, Sir, faid he, fmce youc 
seal carries you fo far, rather than you ihould be 
•lone, I will accompany you, and bring aftout fellow, 
equal to yourfelf, if he will affift us in this deiign : 
And accordingly he brought one called Captain Ri- 
cbar^oH^ Who hearing the ftory, readily confcntcd ; 
but my partner declined it, being altogether out of 
bis way : And fo we three, and my man fervant, 
refolvcd to execute this exploit about midnight ; but 
upon fecond thoughts we dcferred.it to the next night, 
by reafon the caravan being to go from thence next 
morning, we (hould be out of the governor's power. 
Well, 1 procured a Tartar's, (heep-flcin robe, a bon- 
net, with bows and arrows, and every one of us got 
die JiJce naDits. me nrit ul^kt >»rc fpcnr in mixing 
combuftible matter with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, &c. 
having a good quantity of tar in a little pot. And 
the Idt night coming to the idol about eleven o'clock, 
the moon Dcing up, we found none guarding; but 
we perceived a light in the houfe, where we faw 
the priefts before. One man was for firing the hut,. 
another for killing the people, and a third for making 
them prifoncrs, while the idol was dettroyed. And, 
in fliort, to the latter we agreed j fo that knocking at 

Bb a the 



f 304 } 
the door, we feizcd the firft that opened it, then (lop- 
pins his mouth, and tying his feet together, left him 
with the idol. In this manner did we &ye two otbcn, 
but the valiant Scots merchant beinff difcovered at 
length, mfhed in upon them, being backed by uf, 
and fet fire to the compofition, which frightened 
them fo much, that we brought- them all away, u 
prifoners to their wooden jgod. Then we fell to woric 
with him, daubing him allover with tar, mixed with 
tallow and brimftone, flopping his eyes, ears and 
mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild 
fire in his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. 
All this being done, we unloofened and ungag^ 
the priibners, and fet the idol on fire, which the gun- 
powder blowing up, the fliape of it was deformed, 
^ent and fplit, which the foraee utterly confumed; 
fbr we fVayed to fee its deftru£lion, left the ignorant 
idolatrous people fibould have thrown them felves into 
the flame. And thus we came away undifcovered, 
appearing fo bufy in the morning among our fellow 
travellers, that nobody could have fufpeAed, but that 
Kic had been in our beds all night. 

But after we were fet out, and had got fome fmall 
diflaj\ce from the city, there came a great multitude 
©f the country people to the gates, demanding fa- 
tii^rzOU^n of the RuJ/ian Governor , for infulting their 
'prieft?, and burning their great Cham Chi Thaungu^ 
who dvv'clt in the fun, and that no mortal would vio- 
I'/.tr his image, but fome Chriftian mifcreant;s : And 
thrretore, being already 30,000 lirong, they de 
neuincfd war againrt him and all his Chrittians. 

'['tit Governor afiured them he was ignorant of tht 
O^attcr, aiui that none of his garrifon had been out;

Icept thetn in play as long as he could. Hereupon wc 
tnarchcd two dajFS and two nights, ftoppingbut very 
. little, till atlaft we refted at a village called Plotkus^ 
and hafted to Jarmven^^ another of the Czar's colo- 
nies. But on the fecond day's march froin the for* 
mer, having entered the defert, and paiTed the lake 
SfjaJts^O/er^ we beheld a numerous body of horfe on 
Che other fide of it to the north, who fuppofcd we 
had pafled that fide of the lake: and .in three days 
after, having found their miftake, or been informed 
what way we went, they came upon us toward the 
dufk of tne evening, juftas we had pitched our camp 
between two little but very thick woods, with a little 
river running before our front, and we cut down 
feme trees to place in our rear, but before we had 
fihiflied our fituation, the enemy were at hand.. But: 
not falling on us immediately, they font three mcfi'en- 
gers, whoxlenuinded themen who h^id infulted their 
priefts, and burnt their god Cbam Chi ThaungUy that 
they might he burnt, and then they would peaceably 
depart j but if not, they would deftroy them all. . 
Hereupon our men ftared atone another, hut nobody 
was the word, as indeed nobody, knew it b.ut.hc 
whodid it. Upon which the leader of jfehc caravan 
anfwercd, that they were peaceable merchantfs, who 
meddled with none of thcMi* priefts or god.s j and 
therefore dcfired them not to difturb uR,jand put us tO; 
the neoeflity of defending ourfelves. But fo. far was 
this from Satisfying thorn, that the next morning,, 
coming to our right, th^ey let fly a volley of arrows. 
at us, but hurt not any, bccaufc we fheiterod ourfelves. 
under the baggage : But as we expefted to come toi 
an engagement, a cunnin;^: father^ a Cjjfacki obtain--

lains who burnt the Cham Chi Thaungu^ were gone to 
SiMi/Jka, with a refolutlon to burn the god Shal- 
ifar^ belonging to the Tanguefes. Upon whfch, be- 
Jieving this cunning Tartar^ who was fervant to our 
Mufcovites^ away they drove to Sibeiljka^ and in lefe 
than three hours were out of fight, . nor did we ever 
hear of them more. 

When we came t<xthecity^ of 5^<«««wtf, we rcfted 
there five days, and then entered into^a frightful dc- 
fcrt, which held us twenty-^hree days march, infefted 
with feveral fmall companies of rob'&ers or MogidTaf 
iars^ who never had the courage to attack us. But 
after we had paiTed over this place, we found feveral 
Tm-tars : In particular the governor oi Adinjkoy oficrcd 
us a guard of fifty men to the next (lation, if we ap- 
prehended any danger. All this way the natives 
retained the fame Pagantfm and barbarity, only not 
fo dangerous, being conquered by the Afufcoviteu 
The cToathing, both of men and women, are the 
jEkins of bcafts, living under ground in vaults an^ 
^aves, which run into one another. They have idok 
in almoft every family ; befides they adore the fun ani 
.ftars, water and fnow, and the Icaft uncommoD 
thing that happens in the element, alarms them as 
much as thunder and lightning does the unbelieving 

Through all the country nothing more remarkable 
occurred : When we had got through this great deferti 
bcfofe nientioned, after two days farther travel, wc 
came to Janezay^ a Mufcovite city, on the great^ river 
fo called, which, we are told, parts Europe from 
Ma. Neither here are the Pagans much better, thoueh 
ijitermixed with the MufcoviUs ; but the wonder wJl 
ceafc, when I inform ny reader of what was ob- 
fcrved to me, th;it the Czar converts the Tartars mi\t 
foldicrs not clergymen, and is more afliduous to 
make them faithful lUbjccis than good Chriftians. 

froD 



[ 3^7 ] 
From this city to the river Ohy^ wc travelled over 
a pleafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, 
for want of eood management and people, and thofe 
few arc moftly Pagans. This is the place where the 
Mufcoyite criminals are banifhed to, if they arc 
not put to death. The next city we came to, wa^ 
the capital city ot Siberia^ called Tobel/ki^ when having 
been almoft feven months on our journey ,.and winter 
drawing on apace, my partner and I confulted about 
our particular affairs, m what manndr wcfhould d ifpofe 
ofourfclves. We had been told of fledges and rein- 
deer, to carry us over the fnow in the winter feafon, 
the fnow b^ing frozen very hard, making an entire 
covering to the ground, fo that the fledges can run 
upon the furface without any regard to what is be- 
neath. But I, being bound to England^ muft cither 
eo with the caravan to Jerejlaw^ thence weft for 
Narvoy and the gulph of Finland, and fo by land 
or fea to Denmark ; or elfe I muft leave the caravan 
at a little town on the Dwina, and fo go to Archangel, 
-where I was furc of fhippine either to England, Hoi- 
Jand or Hamburg, One nieiit I fell in company with 
an illuftrioiis, but banifhed prince, whofe company 
and virtues were fuch as made me propofea method 
to him to obtain his liberty. My dear friend, faid 
he, as I am free from my mifcrable greatnefs, with 
all its attendants of pride, ambition, avarice and 
luxury ; if I fihould cfcapc from this place, thofe per- 
nicious feeds may revive again, to my lafiingdifquie- 
tude: Therefore let me ftayia^a ble(&d connnement. 
For I am but fieih, a mere man, with paflions and 
affedlions as fucb : O be not my friend and tempter 
too ! Sxtruck dumb with furprize, I ftood filent a 
while ; nor was he in ]c($ diforder, by which perceiv- 
ing he wanted to give vent to his mind, I dcfired h\\n 
taconfiderof it^ and (b withdrew. But about two 
hours after he came to my apartment. Dear friend^ 
iaidhe, though I caonotconfent to accompany you, I 
" (haU 



[ 308 ] 
(hall have this fatisfadtion in parting, that you leave 
me an honeft man ftill ; hut as a teftimony of my af« 
ietS^ion to you, be pleafed to accept this prefent of fa- 
bles. 

I fent my fervant the next morning to his Lord- 
(hip, with a fmall prefent of tea, two pieces of China 
damafk, and- four little wedges of gold : But he on- 
ly accepted the tea, one piece of damafk, and a 
wedge of gold, for the curionty of the Japan (lamp 
lipon it. Not long after he fent for me, and told me, 
that what he had refufed himfelf, he. hoped, upon his 
account, I would grant to another, whom he (hould 
name ; In (hort, it was his only fon, who was above 
200 miles diftant from him on the other fide of the 
Ohy^ whom he could fend for, if I gave niy confent 
This I foon complied with, upon which he fent hii 
fervants the next day for his fon, who returned in 
twenty days time, bringing fevcn horfes loaded with 
valuable furs. At night the young Lord was con* 
du6l6d incog, to our apartment, where his father' pre^ 
fented him to me» We then confulted the bcft way 
for travelling, and, after buying a confiderable quan- 
tity of (ables, black fox-fkins, fine ermines, &c. 
( which I fold at Archangel at a good price ) we fet out 
of this city the beginning of Juney making a fmall 
caravan, being about 32 horfes and camels, of which 
I reprcfented the head. My young. Lord had with, 
him a very faithful Siberian fervant, well acquainted 
with the roads : We fhunncd the principal towns 
and cities, as Tumen^ Sal^KamaJhi^ and feveral others,, 
by reafon of their ftridtnefs in examining travellers,, 
left any of the banifhed perfons of diftin&ion fliould 
cfcape. Having paffed the river Kama^ we came tea 
city on the European fide called Soloy-Kmnojkoy^ where 
we found the people moftly Pagans as before. We 
then paffed adefert about 200 miles over, but in other 
places it is near 7Q0 : In pafling this wild " place,, \ve 
were bcfet by a troop of men on horfeback, about 

forty- 



[ 309 ] 
forty-five, armed with bows and arrows. At firft 
they looked earneftly on us, and then placed them- 
fclves in our wa^. We were above fixteen ment 
and drew up in a little line before our camelt. My 
young Lord fent out his fervant to know who they 
were ; but when he approached them, he neither 
knew a word they faid, nor would they admit him to 
come near them at his peril, but prepared to Utioot 
him. At his return he told us, he believed them to 
be Calmuck Tartan^ and that he thought there were 
more of them upon the defcrt. This was but a fmall 
comfort to us, yet feeing a little grove at about a 
quarter of a mile diftance, we moved to it by the 
old Portuguezi pilot's advice, without meeting any 
oppofition. In this place we found a fpringy piece 
of ground, a great fpring running into a little brook 
on pne fide, joined with another like it a little farther, 
which in (hort was the head of the river Writjka. 
We went to work, immediately cutting down great 
arms of trees, and laid them hanging (not quite cut 
off ) from one tree to another. And thus we waited 
the motions of the encmv, without perceiving any 
advance they made towards us : But about two hours 
before night, being joined by fome others, they made 
abmt 80 horfe, among whom wc fancied were fome 
women, and coming on us with great fury, wc fired 
without ball, calling to them in the Ruffian tongue to 
know their bufinefs ; but they not underilanding uf), 
of pretending fo, came dire^y to the wood-fide, 
-^t confiderins tiiat wc were to fortified, that they 
capuin and engineer, and defirca us ixic\^K oiir 
'they came within piftol-fliot, and hejave the word 
of command J then to take the fureff aim: But he 
did not bid us fire, till they were withm two pikes of 
u« 5 and then w^killed 15 of them, wounded fcveral, 
as alfo their horfw, having every one charged with 
two or three balls at leaft. So much were they fur- 
priwd at our undauntcdnefe, that they feU back about

rooroch from u«» In the metn tim«,.wc loam 
again^ and all fallying out^ feeured four or. five of 
their horr««^ whofe^ickrs we found were killed, and 
pesoiivcd ihem to be Tartars. About an. hour after, 
thejr made another attempt to break iii). but finding 
ua nady to receive them, they retired. 

All that night we worked bard in ftrengthening out 
fituation^ and barracadoing the entrances into the 
^woods i but when day-ligbt came, we made a very 
unwelcome difcovery ; for the «nemv being encou* 
caged by their afliftance, had (ct up citven or twelve 
tents, in the form of a camp, about throe quarters^ 
of a mile from us^ I muft' cQnfe&, I was never more 
concerned in my lifs, giving myfclf, and^ all that t 
had over for loft : As for my partner, as the. iofs ofhi» 
floods would be his ruin^ before they iliould be tai^ea 
from him, be would fight tor the lail drop of his 
blood. But to efcape their numbers, I had recourfe 
to a ftratagem, by kindling a large flame to bum alf 
night i and no fooner was it dark, but we purfued 
our journey towards the pole, or the north irar, and 
£o travelling all night, by fix o'clock in the mom-^ 
ing we came to a Ruffian village, called Kfrmanzuh' 
Jioyy where we paiTecTa little river called Kerxta^ and 
from thence came to a large town named Oztmoys^ 
where we heard that fevcral troops of Cabnuck Tir- 
tars had been abroad upon the defert, but that we 
were paft all danger. Within £ve days after, wc 
came to Veujkma^ upon the river Witzedga : From

CHAPTER I. 

Of Solitude. 

HOWEVER folitudc IS looked upon as a rc- 
ftraint to the pleafures of the world, in 
comply and converfation ; yet it ie a hap- 
py ftate of exemption from a fea of trouble, an 
inundation of vanity and vexation and difappoint* 
ment. While we enjoy purfelves, neither the joy 
nor forrow of other men aflfedt us : We are then at 
liberty, with the voice of our foul, to fpeak to God. 
By this we (hun fuch frequent trivial difcourfe, as ever 
becomes an obftru£lion to virtue : And how often do 
we find we had reafon to wifh we had not been in 
company, or faid nothing when we were there : For 
cither we offend God by the impiety of our difcourfe} 
or lay ourfclves open to the violence of defigning peo- 
ple by unguarded expreffions : And confequently per* 
ceive the coldnefs and treachery of pretended friends, 
when once involved in trouble and affli<5lion : And

rather by falfe inuendoe^ would accumulate miferics 
upon us, than honeftly aifift us when fufFering under

he is fure that he docs not converfe with an ene-

fhould retire into a cell, a defert, or a monaftcr)-, 
which would be altogether an ufelels and unprdiitablc

have an abfolute ncceflity and dependence one upon 
another ; fo there is a retirement of the foul, in 
which it converfes with heaven, even in the mid it of 
men : And indeed no man is more (it to fpeak freely, 
than he, who can without any violence to himfolf, re-

the hidden myiteries of the holy writings : here flie

CHAP. V. 

Of the prefent State of Religion in the IForld. 

I Doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than 
religion in the world, more adoration than fup- 
plication, and more hypocrify than fincerity : And it 
is very melancholy to connder, what numbers of 
people there are, furnifhed with the powers of rca- 
fon and the gifts of nature, and yet abandoned to 
the. grofleft ignorance and depravity. But it would 
be uncharitable. foJr us. to imagine, (as fome Papifts 
abounding with too much ill-nature, the only fcan- 
dal to religion* do) that they will certainly be in the 
ftate of damnation after this life : For how can wc 
thinft it -confident with the mercy and goodncfs of 
an infinite being, to damn thofe creatures, when he 
has not furnifhed them with the light of his jgofpel ? 
Or how can fuch proud, conceited, and cruel bigots 
prcfcribe rules to the juftice and mercy of God? 

e.c 3 Wc 



C 318 3 

Wc are toTd by fome people, that the great image 
wliich King Nebuchadnexzar fet up to be adored by 
his people, held the reprefentation of the fun in his 
right hand, as the principal obje<Sl ^f adoration. 
But to wave this difcourfe of Heathens, how many 
felf-contradiAing principles areheld amongChriftians? 
And how do we doom one another to the devil, while 
all profefs to worfhip the fame Deity, and to expect 
' the fame falvation ? 

When I was at Portugal there was held at that 
time the court of juftice of the inquifition. All the 
criminals were carried in procelfion to the great 
church ; where eight of them were habited in gowns 
and caps of canvas, whereon the torments of hell 
were difplayed, and they were condemned and burnt 
for crimes againft the Catholic faith and BleffeJ 
Virgin. 

I am forry to make any refle<9:ions uponChriftians; 
but indeed in Italy the Romijh religion feems themoft 
cruel and mercenary upon earth : And a very judi- 
cious per Ion who travelled through Italy from furhej 
tells us, '* That there is only the face, and outward 
pomp of religion there; that the church proteSs 
murderers and aflaflins, and then delivers the civil 
magiilrates over to Satan for doing juftice ; interdicts 
whole kingdoms, and fhuts up the churches for want 
of paying a few ccclcfiallic dues, and fo puts a flop to 
religion for want of their money : That the Court 
0/ Inquifition burnt two men for fpeaking difhonour- 
iihly of the BlefTcd Virgin, and the miflionaries of 
China tolerated the worfhipping the devil by their new 
converts : That luily was the theatre, where religion 
wiis the grand opera j and that the Popifli clergy were 
no other than the ftir:;e-players." 

As to religion in Poland^ they deny Chrift to be th? 
MLii::.h, or that the MeiTiah was come in the flci'n. 
And as to their l^rotcilants, they arc the followers or 
LcUus Sccinus^ who denied our Saviour's divinity; 
and hp.vc no concern about the divine infpiration oi 
the Hoi- G holt. In 



[ 319 ] 

In Alufcovy their churches are built of wood, and 
iiulced they have but wooden pricfts, thou,c:h of ihc 
G'r<vi church : They pray as niuch to St. Nicholas^ as 
Papilh do to the Virgin Mary^ for protection In all 
their difficulties e afllidlions. 

As to Lutherans^ they only differ froni th-^ Romans 
in believing Confubftantiation, inftcad of Tranfub- 
ftantiation ; but like them they arc much plcafvd 
with the external gallantry and pomp, more than the 
true and real practice of it. 

In France I found a world of pricfts, the ftrcets 
every where crowded with them, and the churches 
full of women ; but furely never was a nation fo full 
of blind guides, fo ignorant of religion, and evtn 
as void of morals, as thofe people who confcfs their 
fins to them. 

Now it fecms ftrangc, that while all men own* the 
Divine Being, there fhould be fo many different {t\\- 
timents of paying him obedience in the Chriftian 
church : I know not what reafon to affign for this, 
except it be their different capacities and faculties. 

And indeed upon this account, we have perceived 
in all Chriftian countries what mortal feuds have 
been about religion : what wars and bloodflied have 
moleftcd Europe^ till the general pacification of the 
German troubles at the treaty of Wejiphalia ; and 
fnice between the Lutheran cnurchcs ? And fliould I 
take a profpciS at home, what unhappy divifions are 
between Chriftians in this kingdom about Epifcopacy, 
Preft)ytery, the Church of England men and the 
Diflentcrs ; and where they withftand one ariother, 
like St. Paul and St. PeUr^ even to the face ; as 
much as to fay, carry on the difpute to the utmoft 
extremity, 

Itmighrbe a queftion, why there are fuch differ- 
ences in fellgious points, and why thefe breaches 
fhould be fo hot and irrcconcileablc ? All the anfwcr 
I can give to this, is,that we enquire more cdncc rn- 



r 320 J ' 

ing the truth of religion, than any other nation in the 
world ; and the anxious concern we have about it 
makes us jealous of every opinion ; and tenacious of i 
our own : And this is not becaufe we are more fu- ■ 
rious and raih than other people ; but the truth is, \ 
we are more concerned about them, and being fenfi- 
blc that the fcripture is the great rule of faith, the 
ftandard for life and dodrine, we have recourfe to \ 
it ourfelves, without fubmitting to the pretended in- i 
fidlible judge upon earth. 

There is another queftion, pertinent to the former, 
what remedy can we apply to this malady ? And to 
this I muft negatively anfwer, not to have us be Icfs 
ueligious, that we might diiFer lefs about it : And this 
is ftriking at the very root of all religious differences ; i 
for certainly, where they to be carried on with a peace- l 
able fpirit, willing to be informed, our variety of { 
opinions would not have the name of diHerences; ] 
nor ftiould we feparate in communion of charity, , 
though we did not agree in fe veral articles of religion. 

Nor is there a leis ufeful queftion to ftart, namely, 
wJiere will our unhgppy religious differences end ? To 
which I hope I may anfwer. In Heaven: There all 
unchriftian and unbrotherly differences will find a pe- 
riod ; there we fhall embrace many a finner that h^ 
we think it a difhonour to converfe with ; and per- 
ceive many a heart we have broken her? with :Cen- 
fyres, reproaches and revilings, made, whole again 
by, the balm of the fame Redeemer's Wood... Here we 
(li^ll perceive there have been other flocks than thofe 
ofour fold ; that thpfe we have excommunicated, have 
been taken into that fuperior, communion ; and, in a 
word, that thofe contradifting notions and principles, 
which we thought inconfiflent with truq religion, we 
fliall then find reconcileable to the;mfelves, to one an- 
other, and to the fountain .of trutk.. If any man 
afk me, why our differences cannot be ended on 
earth? lanfwcrj were we all thoroughly convinced, 

that 



^ [ 321 ; 

that then they would be reconciled, we would put an 
end to them before j but this is impoflible to be done : 
for as mens certain conviftions of truth are not 
equal to one another, or to the weight and fignifican- 
cy of fuch veracity ; fo neither can a general effect 
of this affair be expedled on this fide of time, this 
fide of the grave. 

Before I conclude this chapter, I (hall beg leave 
to difcourle a little of the wonderful excellency of ne- 
gative religion and negative virtue. The latter fcts 
out like tlie Pharifee^ with God^ I thank tha \ 'tis 
a piece of religious pageantry, the hypocritc'shopcj 
and in a word, 'tis a pofitive vice: For it is either 
a. majk to deceive others, or a miji to deceive ourfcives. 
A man thus cloathed with negatives, thus argues ; I 
am not fuch a drunkard as my landlord, fuch a thief 
as my tenant, fuch a fwearer as my neighbour \ nei- 
ther am I a cheat, an atheiil, a raki(h fellow, or a 
highwayman : No ! I live a fober, regular, retired 
lire : I am a good man, I go to church, God I thank 
thee. Now though a man boads of his virtue in contra- 
diftion to the vices mentioned, yet a" perfon had bet- 
ter be them all together than the man himfelf^ for he is 
To full of himfelf, fo perfuaded that he is good and 
religbus enough already, that he has no thoughts of 
any thing, except it be to pull ofF his hat to God 
Almighty now and then, and thank bim, that he has 
no occauon for him ; and has the vanity to thinlc 
that his neighbours.muft imagine well of him too. 

Now the negative man though he is no drunkard,, 
yet is intoxicated with the pride of his own worth : 
A good neighbour and peacemaker in other families, 
but a tyrant in his own; appears in church for 
afhew, but never falls upon his knees in his clofct ; 
does all his alms before meh to be feen by them i 
eager in the duties of the fecond table, but rcgard- 
leis of the firft ; appears rcliiiious to be taken notice 
qf by men, but without intcrcourle or communicatioii 
. between God and his own foul.. Pray what is thia^ 



wicnour niercy, exacr inc pcnauy oi every fjo; 
the forfeiture of every indenture : why this w 
downright cruelty, and not honefty ; and is 
ry to that general rule, u do to another j tluit u 
would have done unto you. Sometimes neceifit\ 
an honeft man a knave, when. a rich man is ' 
ncft man, but no thanks to him for it. Tl 
of honefty is this : Did you ever want bread, j 
your neig}ibour's loaf in keeping, and would 
rather than eat it ? Were you ever arrefted, hs 
your cuftody another man's cafh, and wouU 
go to gaol than to break it ? If fo, then inde 
may be reckoned honefty. For King Solomon i 
that a good name is better than life^ and is a 
ointment^ and which^ when a man has once loft^ 
nothing left worth keeping,

begging of God to give us that virtue. And the 
more compofed we are in any trouble, the more com» 
niendable is our wirdoni ■; and the larger will be our 
recompence; And let the provocation be what it 
will, whether from a good-natured and confcientious,i 
or a wicked, perverfe, and vexatious man, all this wc 
fhould take as from the over-iuling hand of God, as 
a punifhment forour fins. Many times injured in- 
nocence mdy be abufcd by falfe oaths, or the power of 
wicked, jealous, or malicious men 5 but! we often* 
find It, like the palm, rife the higher, the more it is 
deprefled, wbile the juftice of God is eminently re* 
markable tn punifhing thofe one way or other, who 
dcrfir^ or endeavour ta procure the downfal of an in* 
noccnt man : Nor does God fail comforting an af«r 
iliAed perfon, who with tears and prayers folicits 
ti\c throtte of heaven for deliverance and proteftion. 
David faJrSj' That his foul was full of trouhU, and his 
life dmo near unto the grave. But certainly David's 
aflli£lions made him eminently remarkable, particu-i 
larly when purfued by King Saui^ and hunted as a 
partridge over the rtiountain«. But one thing which 
ftands by ihaocence, is the love of God : For were 
We to fuffir difgrace, nay, an ignominious death it*

CHAP. IV, 

Of Immorality of Converfationj and the vulgar Errors 
of Behaviour. ' 

AS converfation is a great part of human happi- 
nefs, fo it is a pleaiant fight to behold a fweet 
tempered man, who is aj>vays fit for it ; to fee an air 
,^ humour and jrieafantncfs fit upon every brow, and 
even fomething angelic upon every countenance-: 
Whereas if we obfcrvc a defigning man, wc (hall find

nefs of the Almighty Creator : For otherwife it woujd 
he abfurd to think that God fhould create a world, 
without any care or providence over it, in guiding 
the operations of nature, fo as to preferve the order 
of his creation. 

Revealed religion gives us light into the care and 
concern of his Providence, by the climates being 
made habitable, the creatures fubjedled and made nou- 
rifhing, and all vegetative life made medicinal ; ^nd 
all- this for the fake of man, who is made viceroy to 
the king of the earth. The fhort defcription I ihall 
give of Providence is this, that it is that operation 
of the power, of the wifdom, juftice and goodncfs 
of God, 'by which he influences, governs and direfts, 
not oi^ly the means, but the events oJF all things, 
which Concern us iti this iublunary world ; the fove- 
reignty of which we ought always to reverence, obey 
its [motions, obferve its dilates ; and ii/?en to its voice. 
The prudent man forefeeth evii, and bideth bimfelf; 
that is, as I take it, there is a fecret Providence inti- 
mates to us, that ibme danger threatens, if ^ we ftrive 
not to fliun it. 

The fame day (fhat Sir Jcfvi Hoiham kept put Hull 
agalnft the royal martyr King Charles I. the fame day 
Sir yohn Hotham was put to death by the parliament 
for that very aclioji- : • the fame day that the Kin;

dciy he v/as voted abdicated by the parliament, and the 
throne filled with King h^ llllam and Queen Alary, 

The voice of fignal deliverances from fuddcn dan- 
gers, is not only a juft call to repentance, but a cau- 
tion againft falling into the like danger : But fuch, 
who are utterly carclcfs of them fel vcs after, Ihew 
a lethargy of the worfl: nature, which fcems to me io

be. a kmd of praAical atheifm, or at lead a living in 
a contempt of heaven, when he receives good at the 
hand of his maker, but is unconcerned at the nature 
* and original pf it ; neither when he receives evil docs 
it bring him to any ftate of humiliation* 

We have a remarkable ftory of tWQ foldiers being 
condemned to death in Flandtrs^ the general being 
prevailed upon to fpare one of them, ordered them to 
call dice upon the drum head for their lives : The 
ftrft throwing two fixes, wrung his hands, but was 
furprized when the other threw two fixes alfo. The 
officer appointed to fee the execution ordered them to 
throw again \ they did fo, and each of them threw two 
fives ; at which the foldiers that ftood round (hbuted^ 
and fitid neither of them was to die. Hereupon the 
officer acquainted the council of war, who ordered 
them to throw again, and then came up two fours : 
The general being made acquainted with it, fends 
for the men, and pardoned them : / love^ fays he, 
infuch extraordinary cafes, to lijlen to the voice of Pro^ 
vidence. 

We read in the holy^ writings, how God fpeaks to 
men, by appearance of angels, ■ or by dreams and 
vifions of the night. As God appeared to Abraham^ 
Lot J and Jac^b ; fo aneels have appeared to many in 
-other cafes, as Manoah and his wife, Zacharia, the 
Virgin Mary^ and to the apoftles ; others have been 
warned in a dream, as King Mimilcchy the faJfe pro- 
phet Balaam, and many others. 

It is certainly a very great and noble enquiry, what 
we {hall be after this life, being aflured that there is 
a place referved for the reception of our fouls afte/ 
death : For if we arc to be, we muft have a where^ 
which the fcriptures aflert by the examples of Dive$ 
and Lazarus, The dodrine of fpirits was long be« 
Hcved before our Saviour's time } for even the dif- 
ciples of theblefledjefus ^rceiving our Saviour walk- 
ing on the fea^ they were much iurprized^ as though 
D d they 



[ 3*6 ] 
they had fecn a fpirit, N^y, in thofe ages of the 
world, it was believed that fpirits moermeddled in 
the affairs of mankind ; and throughout the Old 
Teftament I do not find any inftitution, that in the 
leaft contradi(£b it. All the pains and labour that 
fomc learned men have taken to confute the ftory of 
the witch of EncUr^ and the appearance of an old man 
perfonating Samuely cannot make fuch apparitions in- 
' confident with nature or religion : And it is plain, 
fhat, was it either a good or bad fpirit, it prophetically 
told the' unfortunate king what fliould happen the 
next day : For, fatd the fpirit. The Lord will delivtr 
thee into the hand of the PhiH/lines ; and to-narrow jhct 
thou^ and thy fons^ he with me. 

Abundance of ftrange notions poilefled me when I 
was in the defolate iflan<l ; efpecially of a moonfliiny 
night, when every bufli fcemed a man, every tree a 
man on horfeback. When I crept into i^t> difmal 
cave, where the old goat lay expiring, whofe articu- 
Jate groans even refembled thofe of a man, how was 
I furpri^ed on this occafion, when my blood chillei 
in my veins, a cold fweaty dew fat on miy forehead, 
my hair ftood upright, and my joints, like Bel/haz- 
zar^s knees, (hook againft one another. And indeed, 
though I afterwards found what it was, the remains 
©f this furprize did not wear off me for a great while ; 
and I had frequently fomc returns of thofe vapours 
on different occafions, aod fometimes without any oc- 
cafion at all. 

One night, after having feeh fome appearance in 
the air, as I had jufl laid down in my bed, one of 
my feet pained me, after that came a numbnefs fuc- 
ceeded with a tingling in my blood ; when on a fud- 
dcn I thought fomething alive lay upon me, from my 
knee to above half my leg. Hereupon immediately 
I flung myfelf out of bed in the dark, where I thought 
the creature lay : But finding nothing, Lord deliver me 
from an evil fpirit , feid I, what can this hef And 

when 



[ 3^7 ] 
when I lighted a candle, I could perceive no iivins 
.creature in the place with me, but the poor parrot^ 
wbp being frighted, cried out. Hold y^ur tongue^ and 
lyhdfs tbi matter with you f which words I had 
taught him, by faying io to bim, when he made Tuch 
fcreathing iioifes that I did not like. Loriy faid I 
aloud, furely the devU has been here. Hold your tongue^ 
fays PolL ' I then was mad at the bird, and putting 
on my cloaths, cried lam terribly frighted. Whate 
tht matter with seuf fays Poll, You^oad* f4id It 
rU knock your mAs out. Hold your tongue^ Q^ki 
he again* and .(b fell a chattering* and calling Robin-' 
fin Lrufhe^ a$ be did before But after I had compofed 
myfclf, and went to bed aeain, I began plainly to fee 
it was a di temper that aneA^d the nerves, and fp 
my terrors vaalihedat once. 

How intelligences arc giiren or received, we do not 
know ; nor are we fenfible. of. their being conveyed this 
way, from the fpirits unembodied, to ours that are 
in life ;. or of their being conveyed that way, name- 
ly, from us to them : The latter certainly is done 
without the help of organs, and the former is con-*^ 
veyed by the underftanding, and the retired faculties 
of'^the foul. 

The fpirits, without the help of voices, convcrfe.. 

The more particular difcoveries of the convcrfe of 
fprits,Yeem to me as follow : 

Dreams, voices, noifcs, impulfes, hints, appre* 
heniions,' involuntary fadnefs, &c. 

Dreams of old were the ways by which God him- 
fclf was plea fed to warn men what ferviccs to per- 
formy and what tolhun. ^^/^ was directed of God 
in a dream to go to Egypt^ and fo were the wife men 
warned in a dream to depart into their own country 
another way, to avoid the fury of Herod, . I am not 
like thofe who think.dreams are the mere dofingsof 
a delirious head,. or therelids of a day's perplexities or 
pleafures > but oa the contrary^. I muft take leave to 
D d 2 fay. 



: 3*8 ] 

fay, I never had any capital mifchief befel me inmy 
life, but I had fonfe notice of it by a dream ; and 
had I not been a thoughtlefi unbelieving creature, I 
might have taken many a warning, and avoided ma- 
ny of the evils I afterwards fell into, merely by a to- 
tal negle£t of thofe dreams. 

I remember, 1 was prefent at a difpute between a 
lavman and a clergyman upon the fubjed of dreams : 
The iirft thought no regard fhould be given unto 
them, that their communication from the invifibleto 
the vifible world was a mere chinera^ without any 
folid foundation : For, i. ( faid he) if dreams were 
from the agency of any prelcient being, the motives 
would be more direct, and the difcoveries more plains 
and not by allegories and emblematic fiuicies expref- 
fmg things imperfeA and obfcure. 2« Since, with the 
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid 
it, it is not likely to proceed from a fpirit, but meiely 
fortuitous. 3. That the inconftancy of fuch notices, 
in cafes equaily important, prove they djd not pro- 
ceed from any <uch asent. 4. That as our moft dif- 
tindl dreams had nothing in them of any fignificancy, 
it would be irrational and vain to think that they came 
from heaven. And, 5. That as men were not always 
thus warned or fupplied with notice of good or evil, 
(o iiil men are not alike fupplied with them ; and what 
reafoii could we give, why one man or one woman 
fliould j:ot have the fame hints as another. 

To all this the clergyman gave anfwer, i. That 
A'i to the fignification of dreams, and the obje^ons 
a;/ainii: them, as being dark and doubtful, they are ex- 
prdWd generally by hieroglyphical reprefentations, fi- 
milic^, allufions, m>d figurative emblematife'' ways, by ' 
which means, for want of interpretation, the thing 
was not ijiidcrftocd, and conTequently the evil not t 
fhunned. 2. That we charge God fooliihly, to fay he ■ 
has given the notice of evil without the powxr ta 
avoid it ; for if any one had not power to avoid the 



[ 3^9 J 
tvil, it was no notice to him ; and it was want of 
giving due heed to that notice, th;3t men firft ne- 
glcAed tfiemfelvts, anH then charged the Judge of all . 
the earth, with injullice. 3. That we ought not to 
find fault with the inconftancy of thefc notices, but 
rather out crazy underftandings bv pretending dreams 
were not to be regarded, and negle^^ when the voice 
really fpoke to us for our good. It was a great mlf^- 
take to .fanr dreams; had no import at ^1 ; it might 
rather belaid^ non^. that Mre could! perceive 'the rca- 
fon of,'which wtDR owing to our bihidnefs and fupine

was constantly and equally l^ind and careful:; but pur

urged the gentleman, and purfued him like a voice, 
with, go to London, go to London. Hark ye, fays he 

Shis friend, is ail well at London ? Am I iKranted 
ere i Or did you alk me to go with you on any par- 
ticular account ? are all my family well ? Yes, in-< 
deed, Sir, faid he^ I per(:eivcd them all very hearty ; and 
I did not afk you to go to London upon any particular 
account whatioever, except it Was for the fake of 
your good company. Again, he put ofF his rcfolu-» 
tion, but ftill the.Impulfe fuggefted to bim. Goto 
I^ndon 'y and at length he did fo ; and when he came 
there he found a letter and meflenger had been there 
to feek him, and. to tell him of a particular bufmeif, 
which was firft and laft alcove a thoufand pounds to 
him^ and which might h^e inevitably been loft, had 
be not returned to London that night. 

The obeying of fcveral hints, or. fecret impulfcs, 
argues great wifdom. I knew a man that, was under 
misfortunes, being guilty of mifdemeanors againft the 
government ; when, abiconding for fear of his ruin, 
all- his friends advkiing him not to put himfelfinthe 
hands of^ the. law$ one morning as he awaked,' he 
felt a ftrong impulfe darting into his mind thuf , fVriti 
a letter to tDtm : And this was repea|:ed, feveral times 
to his mind, and at laft he anfwcred to it as if it had- 
been a voice, Whojhalllwriteio? Immediately it re- 
turned. Write to the Judge : And this impulfe purfucd 
him for feveral days, till at length he took pen, ink 
and paper, and fet down to write to him ; when, im-. 
mediately words flowed from his pen like ftreams 
from a fair fountain, that even charmed himfelf with 
expeftation of fuccefs ; In fhort, the letter was. fn 
(trcnuous an argument, fo pathetic in its eloquence, 
and perfuiiTively moving, that when the judge had 
read it, he fent him an anfwer he might be eafy, for 
he would endeavour to make that matter light to him ; 
and indeed never left exerting himfelf, till he had ftopt

the profecution, and reftored him to his liberty and 
family. 

I knew a perfon, who had fo ftrong an impreflion 
upon her mind/ that the houfe (he was in would be 
burnt that very nighty that fhe could not go to fleep, 
the impulfe flie had upon her mind preflfed her not to 
zo to bed) which however fhe refitted and went to 
bed, but was terrified with the thought, which, as 
ihe called it, run in her mind, that the houfe would 
be burnt, that ihe could not go to fleep. So much 
difcovery had (he made of her apprehenfions in the 
family, that they were all in a fright, and applied 
themieves to fearch from the top of the houfe to the 
bottom, and to fee every fire and every candle fafe 
out, fo that, as they all faid, it was impoffible any 
thing could happen in the houfe, and they fent to 
the neighbours on both fides to do the like. Thus 
far they did well, but had fhe obeyed the hint, which 
prefled upon her flrangely not to go to bed, flie had 
done much better, for the fire was adlually kindled at 
that time, though not broken out; About an hour 
after the whole family was in bed, the houfe juft 
over the way, diredtly oppofite, was all in a flame, and 
the wind, which was very high, blowing the flame 
upon the houfe this gentlewoman lived in, fo filled 
it with fmoke and fire in a few moments, the flreet

{ood ones arc pleafed to give. We never perceive th< 
misfortune of this, but when in real danger; and 
then we cry, my mini mifgavi me^ when I was go- 
ing about it : But if fo, why did you flight th^ cau- 
tion ? Why not liften to it, as to a voice ? And thtn 
there had been no seafon to make this complaint. 

I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago ^.a« 
to time I cannot be very pofitive ) there was a young 
clergyman in the city of Dublin in Ireland who 
had a very uncommon dream. I'hat a eentleman 
bad^illed bis wife I who was a relation of his; by (bb« 
biag her in feveral places. The fright of diis foon 
aw^ed bim ; he then fell afleep a fecond time, dreamt 
the fame dream ; and, in fhort, a third time alfo. 
So troubled was he in his mind, that he arofe, and 
knockine at his mother's chamber, told his concern, 
and of his apprehcnAons that all was not right at his 
relation's houfe. Dear fon, fsws the good old gen- 
tlewoman, mind not thefe foolifh dreams : and I very 
much wonder that you, being a perfon in holy or- 
ders, fhould have regard to fucb illufions. He went 
to bed again, flept and dreamt as before. And then 
indeed he put on his night-gown, and went to Smith' 
fields the place where his relation dwelt. Here it was, 
alas ! he perceived his dream too fadly fulfilled, by fee- 
ing his relation, the young lady, big v/ith child, who 
was a Protcftant, ftabbcd in feven places, by her bar- 
barous hufband, Mr. Eujiace^ a rigid Papift, only up- 
on fome difcourfes of religion that happened the duy 
before : After the wretch had ftabbcd her in three 
places, he endeavoured to efcapc out of a window, 
but Ihe cried My dear^ don^t leave me^ come back \ and 
IJhall be well again. At which he returned in a hellifli 
rage, and gave her four wounds more ; when even 
in this condition, rifing from her bed, (he wrapt herfclf 
in her night-gown, and went to the Lord Biftiop of 
R^iph's chamber-door ( the Biftiop lodging at thnt

time in the houfe ) my Lord^ faid (he, ^ my Lord^ 
nuikt hajli unto me ; but as foon as his Lordfhip came, 
ihe expired in his arms, rcfigning her precious foul 
into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel wretch 
her hufband was fhot by the purfuers, too good 
. a death for one who deferred tlie gibbet : The lady 
was uiiivcrfally lamented by all tender and religious 
people. And this tragical relation I have mentioned 
upon the account of that impulfe, or dream, that the 
clergyman had at the &tal time of the bloody ad. 

It might be expected I (hould enter . upon the fub« 
ytOi of apparitions, and difcourfe concerning the rea- 
lity of them ; and whether they can revifit d:^ place of 
their former exigence, and refume thofe faculties of 
fpeech and iliape which they had when living ! but 
as thefe are very doubtful matters, I fhall only make 
a few obfcrvations upon them. 

I once heard of a man who would allow the reality 
of apparitionN, but laid it all on the devil, and think- 
ing the fouls of men departed did never appear ; yet 
to this very man fomething did appear, and then he 
faid, he faw the fhapeof an antient man pafs by him 
in the dufk, who holding up his hand in a threaten- 
ing pofturc, cried out, O wicked man^ repent^ repinU 
Terrified with this apparition, he conlultcd feveral 
friends, who advifcd him to take the advice. But, 
•after all, it was not an apparition, but a grave and 
pious gentleman, who met him by mere accident, 
and had bfcn made fenfible of his wickednefs ; and 
who never undeceived him, left it Ihould hinder his 
reformation. Where we always willing to make 
good ufe of Satan's real appearances, I know not 
but it would go a great way to banifh him from 
the vifible world j for I am very pofilive he would 
fcldom vifit, if he thought his coming would do us 
any good : But fo abfolutely is he at the com- 
mand 



'[ 336 1 
fnand of heaven, that he'muft go, even to do the 
work he abhors. 

Some people make a very ill ufe of the general no-* 
tion, that there are no apparitions, nor fpirits at all ; 
which is worfe than thofe who fancy they fee them upon 
every occaiion : For thofe carry^heir notions farther; 
even to annihilate the devil, and believe nothing about 
him, neither of one kind or other : tlie next ftep 
they come to is to conclude Tiere is m God\ and 
ib atheifm takes its rife in the fame fmk, with 
a carelcflncfs about futurity : But there is no occafion 
to enter upon an argument, to prove the being of 
the Almighty, or to illuftrate his power by words, 
who has fo many undeniable teftimonies in the breaft 
of every rational being to prove his exiftence : and 
we have fufficlent proofs enough to convince us of the 
great fuperintendency of Divine. Providence in the 
minuteft affairs of the world, .the manifeft exiftence 
pf the invifible world, the reality of fpirits, and 
intelligence between us and theni* What I have 
(aid, I hope will not miftead any perfon, or be a 
means whereby they may delude themfelves : For I have 
fpoken of thefe things with the utmoft ferioufnefs of 
mind, and with a fincere and ardent defire for the 
general good and benefit of the world.
