Robinson Crusoe.
Chapter I.
I was born in the town of York,
in the spring of 1632. I was the
third son of a man of some wealth,
and I had a good home. I was not
bred to a trade, for my friends had
a wish that I should learn the law as
a means to help me through life.
But, as I grew up, I made up my
mind to go to sea; from a child, my
head had been full of the sea, for
when I was but a small boy I would
sit, for hours at a time, on the banks
of a small stream that was near our
house, and dream of ships and the

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
sea. My friends did all they could
to keep me at home, but it was of
no use, for in the fall of 1651 I ran
off, and soon found my way down
on board of a ship bound for a large
town on the south-east coast of the
land. When safe on board the ship
I felt quite proud and glad, but if I
had known all I had to pass through
in the rest of my life I would have
gone back home, but as I did not, I
went on my way, and though I had
a great deal of bad luck, God took
care of me through it all, and taught
me in time what was for my good.
We had scarce left the land, when
the wind blew up strong and kept
up for a few days, and then a great
storm came on, and one night I
heard one of the men cry out, "The
N CRUSOE.
ship has sprung aleak." All hands
were brought on deck, and set to
work at the pumps. We could hear
the ship creak, and her beams crack
from end to end, and soon it gave
way, and we found that we must do
all we could to save our lives.
We saw a ship a short way off,
and gave them a sign, to make them
know that we were in need of aid.
They came near to us, and sent out
two small boats which we got into,
and we were all soon on board the
ship, and in a short time we were
safe back in the town we came from,
where we met friends who gave us
food and clothes, as well as means to
help us reach our homes.
You will say that now I ought to
have gone home, but I had both
clothes and means, and I was too
proud to go back. The man who
had lost his ship said to me, "Young
man, you ought not to go to sea; this,
your first trip, should be to you a
sign that God will not help you if
you do."
Though I knew he was right, I
was hurt at this, and spoke back in a
rude way, and would not heed him,
but thought I would try it once more.
This time our ship was bound for
some isles in the south. We had
been out six weeks, and were far on
our way, when we saw a queer ship
full of men on our track, and we
could see they were not friends. We
thought we could keep clear of them,
or, if there was need for it, fight them
off, so we put on all our sails, but in
a few hours they caught up to us.
We found they were Turks. They
came on board of our ship, and
though we fought them as well as
we could, they had more men and
guns than we, and when they had
cut all our sails, done all the harm to
the ship they could, put to death
three of our men, and hurt near all
the rest, we had to yield.
They took us to their land, and sent
most of the men to their King, but
the chief of the Turks took me as his
own prize and made a slave of me.
This was a great change for me,
and my heart sank with grief. I had
time now to think of my home, and
all that the dear ones had told me,
but it was too late now, I must do
the best I could. At first I had to
work hard, but as I was young and
quick, the chief soon took me to his
own house to wait on him. From
this time my whole mind was bent
on how I could get off and be free.
I thought, "if the chief will take me
with him when he goes to sea, I will
find a way," but this he would not
do, for when he went to sea he left
me home to work on his farm, and
take care of the house, and when
he was at home I had to fish, and
watch his ship.
When I had been with him two
years he was not so strict, but would
take me with him when he went out
to fish.
One day he sent me with a small
boat to catch some fish, and I brought
home a fine lot, which made him so
glad that he said some guests were
to dine with him the next day, and I
must go out for the fish. He sent
me out in a small ship, with a man,
a Moor, and a boy whose name was
Xury. Now, I thought, this is my
chance to get off; I will be free this
time. I told the boy to get two guns
and some shot, and sent the Moor
for some tools, while I put some food
and wine in the ship, and when we
had all our things on board we set
sail. When we had gone out for a
mile, we sat down to fish, but as the
Moor was a man I felt I could not
trust, I would not pull up my lines,
for I did not want him to see the fish,
and I said to him, "There are no fish
here, we must go out to sea," and
when we had gone for a league, I
put my arm round his waist and
threw him far out in the sea.
He swam up to the ship, and said
if I would take him in, he would go
with me, and stay all his life with me.
I told him I did not want him, and
bade him swim back to the shore.
Xury swore he would be true to me,
and as I thought I would be safe
with him, and he might be of great
use to me, I let him go with me.
We had a fair wind, and in a few
days we were a great way out of the
Turks' reach. As I still had some
fear, I kept out of the way of land
for some time, but we found we must
go on shore to get food and drink.
We came to a place where it was
still, and we saw no one, and I told
Xury we would stay here for the
night, but as soon as it was dark, we
heard such barks and growls, that
we thought we would not go on
shore 'till morn, when Xury said, that
if wild men or beasts came, he would
"give them shoot gun." He could
talk quite well, as he had been so
much with the white slaves that the
Turks had.
In the morn, Xury said that if I
would take the boat close up to the
shore, and give him one of the jars
we had with us, he would go and see
if there were springs near by, and
what he could find to eat. I said to
him, "Why should you go; why not
let me go?"
He said, in a way full of love, "If
wild mans come, they eat me, you
go way."
"Well Xury," said I, "we will both
go, and if wild mans come, we will
kill them—they shall not eat us."
When we were most up to the
land, a large beast came down to the
edge of the shore, and gave such a
loud- roar, that Xury cried out with
fear. I took up my gun and shot at
him, which sent him back with a cry
of pain. I knew I had hurt him,
but he fled to the woods and we saw
no more of him.
Chapter II.
We then brought the boat up on
shore, but for fear some harm might
come to it, I thought I would stay
near by and watch it, so Xury took
the gun and the jar, and went off to
the south; he soon came back with
the jar full, and on the end of his
gun a hare that he had shot, and
told me with great joy that he had
seen "no wild mans."
I then told Xury to cook our meal,
and when it was done, we sat down
and ate the hare, with some wild
fruit he had found, and the bread we
had left, and when we were through,
put off to sea once more.
As near as I could guess, the Cape
Verd isles were not far off, and I
made up my mind to keep close to
the coast, in hopes that I might fall
in with some ship which would take
me in, and I should be with friends
once more.
As we went up the coast, Xury,
whose eyes were more on the watch
than mine, saw a huge beast that lay
on his side near the shore. I told
Xury, "You shall go on shore and
kill him."
"Me kill! he eat me up with one
mouth," Xury said, in great fright.
I thought he might do us some
good and took up my gun and shot
at him. It did not kill him, but
broke his leg, at which he set up
such a loud roar, that Xury could do
nought for some time but stand and
gaze.
He said he must have some of
him, and told me to give him the
axe, and he would cut off his head;
he went on shore but he found he
could not take his head, so he came
back with one of his feet and a part
of the leg. I saw it was so large that
I thought I would like his skin, as it
would be of great use to me.
Xury and I went to work at him,
it took us both the whole day, but at
last we got the hide off of him, and
I let it hang for two days in the sun
to dry. I found it nice and soft to lie
on, and it made me a good bed.
In one place some black men came
down to the edge of the shore; one
of them had a long lance and the rest
held clubs and sticks. We were in
need of food and drink, and I thought
I would go up to them, but Xury
thought from signs they made, they
would like to kill us, and cried out
in great fear, "No go! No go!"
I had some of the beast we had
shot which I did not like to eat, so
I threw it to them, and made signs
that we would like some food. When
they saw that we did not mean to
hurt them, one of them went off, and
in less than half an hour came back
with fruit, dry meat, and a kind of
corn, but I did not know what it was,
as we did not raise that kind in our
part of the world. We did not know
how we should get these things, for
we did not want to go on shore, and
they did not like to come to us, but
at last they put them on the edge of
the shore and went off; we were glad
of this, for they were a wild set, and
wore no clothes.
We went on for ten or twelve days
more, but did not meet a ship, and
my heart was full and sad. I thought
we would starve, and that I should
die, and I could not help but feel
that it was all my own fault.
One day I gave Xury charge of
the ship, and sat down in one end, to
think what I should do, and how I
could get food, as we did not dare to
go on shore, for fear of wild men and
beasts. I was sad, and gave up all
hope, when all at once Xury cried,
"A ship with a sail." How my heart
rose with joy, but poor Xury did not
share it with me, he thought it was
the Turk who had come to take us
back. I saw that it was a large ship,
but could not tell where it was from.
They did not see us at first, so I took
a small flag that I had, and made a
waft of it, and shot off my gun for
a sign; they did not hear the gun,
but when they saw the smoke, they
brought to, and lay by for me, and
in less than two hours' time I came
up with them.
The ship was from Spain, and
bound for the south. A Scotch man
on board said to me, "Who are you,
and where are you from?"
I told him how I had run from
the Turk, and this he told the man
in charge, who said I must come on
board, and took both Xury and me,
as well as all my goods in his ship.
I was so sick of the sea, that I
thought, "when I reach the land I
will stay there"; and so when the man
said he would pay me for my boat,
and buy Xury from me, I told him
he could have the boat, but Xury had
been so good to me, that I would
not like to sell him for a slave.
He said, if Xury would be a good
boy, he would set him free in a few
years, and as I was at a loss to know
what I should do with him, I let the
man take him.
In a few weeks we came to the
coast of a large land, which lays
south-west of my own land, and there
I made up my mind to stay.
The gold the man gave me for my
boat and the things that were in it,
was quite a large sum, and I had ten
pounds at home with a friend, so I
thought I would buy a farm.
While I went to look round for
one, I met a man whose name was
Wells; he had some stock but not
much gold. He thought he would
like to buy a farm. He said to me,
that he thought if we would join our
means, we could buy a large farm
and make it pay us well. I saw that
he was a good man and knew how
to farm, so I sent to my friend for
my gold, and we bought a large farm
near the coast.
I now saw what a help Xury would
be to me, and I felt I had done wrong
to part with him, for in a short time
we had to buy two more slaves to
help us work our farm. The friend
who sent me my gold, sent with it
some cloth, baize, dress goods, and
some small wares, which I gave in
trade to the men where we were, and
to those who came on shore from the
ships that went by, and in a few
months I was in a fair way to make
a great deal of gold.
CHAPTER III.
All went on well for four years, our
stock grew fast, and we were soon
quite rich, but this kind of a life did
not suit me, my old wish to roam
came on, and in spite of all I had
gone through each time I went to
sea, I felt I would like to go once
more. What more did I do here
than I would have done at home with
my friends, and was it for this that I
had left them all. No! I would go
off as soon as I could get a chance,
and do some great thing yet.
My kind friend who had brought
me here had been gone for some
time, and I felt bad that I had not
gone with him.
o
One day while I was in this mood,
three men came to me and said they
would like me to take a share in a
large slave ship they had, and go
to sea in it. I told them I would
go with all my heart, if they would
look out for my farm, which they
were glad to do. I made a sort of
will, in which I told the men what
to do with my share in the farm in
case of my death, and made the man
who had brought me here, and who
was so kind to me, my heir.
In a" few days I set sail, which,
strange to say, was just eight years
from the day I had left home.
We had on board six guns, and a
crew of ten men and five boys. Our
stock of goods was toys, beads, bits
of glass, shells, and such odd things,
that we knew we could trade for
slaves.
We soon lost sight of land, and
for two weeks the sea was calm, and
the air clear and hot, and then there
came a great change. One day there
blew up a great gale and a fierce
storm set in, and for three days we
could not steer the ship, she was
thrown round in such a way, and the
high seas that came on us took off a
man and a boy. In the midst of this
one of the men said he saw land, and
we thought we would try to reach it,
but it was of no use, and though we
did all we could, we could not save
the ship, it struck on a sand bar.
We could not move, and we could
not stay here, for we thought the ship
would break in two.
There was a small boat on the
ship, which the mate let down, and
we all got in, but did not have much
hope, as the sea was so wild and
rough, and the storm so great. We
felt that nought but God's care could
save us; we had gone but a short
way, when there rose a great high
wave that fell on our boat, and swept
us all out into the sea.
I was full of dread and fear, and
thought there was no hope for me, but
as I swam round, I saw, quite a way
off, a piece of land, which I thought
if I could reach I would be safe.
With the aid of the waves I swam
straight for it, and when there the
first thing I did was to thank God
for my life, and then to look for the
rest of the men, but they must have
y
all gone down, for I saw them no
more, nor a sign of them, but three
of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
which were not mates.
I knew it would not do for me to>
sit still here, but must get up and
look round me, and see what kind of
a place I was in, and as night was
near, how and where I should sleep.
It was too late to see much of the
place, but not far off I found a thick
tree like a fir, full of thorns. I thought
I woul(^ make this do to sleep in,
and though I saw no signs of them,
I was full of fear of wild men and
beasts, so I took my knife and cut
me a sharp stick, and when it was
dark I got up in my tree, where I
slept as well as I think few could
have done in my state.
When I woke up the next morn,
it was quite late, and the sun shone
bright and clear. I could see the
ship as it lay one.end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off, and the
small boat, which was lost, was so far
off I could but just see it. At noon
the sea was calm, and the tide low,
so that I could swim to the ship, and
as it was warm, I took off most of
my clothes and laid them on the sand,
and went to the ship.
Here I found fresh cause for grief,
for I saw if we had kept on board
we would all have been safe, that is
to say, we could all have got safe to
the land, and I would not have been
all that was left. At first I did not
know how to get up on the ship, but
when I had swam round her twice,
I spied a small piece of strong rope
that hung down on one side, and
with the aid of that, and hard work,
I at last got up on deck.
You may be sure that my first
work was to search for bread, which,
when I had found it, I made a good
meal off, and then I went to see what
else there was in the ship, that I could
take on shore.
• But how could I get them there?
I must have a boat to do this. The
small boat, as I have said, was too far
off, and there was none on the ship.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for
what was not to be had. I found
there were some spare yards, a mast
or two, some large spars of wood,
and some rope and planks. I thought
I would go to work and see what
I could do with these, so I took some
rope and put it round each of the
spars, and flung them in the sea, and
then I threw the planks down, and
when this was done, I went down
the ship's side, and put four of the
spars end to end, and with the rope
I made them as well as I could in
the form of a raft, and laid two or
three short planks on it. I found I
could walk on this, but it was too
light to bear a great weight. I then,
with a saw I had found, cut one of
the large masts in three lengths, and
put them to my raft
.
This took much time and toil, but
the fear that I would starve kept me
up. My raft was now quite strong
and large, and my next care was,
what to load it with, and how to save
31
what I put on it from the serf of the
sea. I first laid all the loose planks
and boards I could get on it, and
then I put on three chests which I
had found in one of the rooms of the
ship. I thought one of the chests
would be just the thing for me to put
my food in, as it would keep it dry,
so I put in it some bread, rice, cheese,
dry meat, and some corn, which had
been laid by for some fowls which
we brought to sea with us. I found
a large case of rum, but there was
no need to put that in the chest, so
I put it up by the side of it.
By this time the tide was up, and
though the sea was calm, 'I saw my
coat, vest, and shirt, which I had left
on the sand, float off. This made me
think of some clothes, and I went
down in the ship, and found some
that had been worn by the men, and
I took all that I thought I would
need for a time.
In the same room where the
clothes were, I found what was a
great prize to me, worth more than
a ship full of gold would have been
at that time, a chest with some tools
in it. I took it down to my raft,
whole as it was, as I did not have
time to look through it. I then went
for some arms. There were three
good guns, a bag of shot, -two old
swords, an old horn, and three kegs
of gun dust. The rest were so wet,
that I knew they would be of no use
to me.
33
CHAPTER IV.
I put all these things on my raft,
and then set off for the land. For a
time my raft went well; but as it
was so large, and I had so much on
it, I could not use my oars, and the
sea was so strong, that I was in fear
I would not reach the shore, but
drift out from it. So I had to sit
with my back to the chests to hold
them up, and wait for the tide to
come in, which it did in the course
of an hour, and sent my raft quite
high up on the shore, and here I
thought I should lose all my goods,
for it sent one end up so high, that
I thought all the rest would fall in
the sea, so I struck out my oars, and
thrust the raft off a short way, and
then stuck the oars in the ground,
one on each side of the raft near the
ends, which held it down straight,
and so that it could not move.
When I had brought my goods
upon the shore, I took out my pipe,
and sat down to smoke. I thought
of the past, of my friends at home; I
knew they would think me dead, and
mourn for me. I did not see how I
could send them word, or get off, for
the isle I was on did not seem to
have a soul on it. It was out of the
way of the course of ships and trade,
and though I could hear birds sing
and beasts cry, still I felt I was lost
to the world, and felt sad and sick at
heart.
While I sat here, a great bird flew
by me and I shot at it; I think it
was the first gun that had been shot
off on the isle, for the fowls and birds
flew out from all sides, and set up
loud cries of fright. The bird I took
to be from its beak a kind of hawk,
though its claws were not like nor
near as large as a hawk's; it was not
good for food, so I threw it on the
ground.
What to do, or where to rest this
night, I knew not. I did not like to
lie on the ground; my tree was too
far off, and I knew I must stay near
my goods to watch them; so I made
a kind of hut with the chests and
boards, and I laid down on some of
the boards, but I did not sleep well,
for the boards were hard, and I had
such great fear of wild beasts.
The food I had brought from the
ship I knew would last me some
days, and I had seen some hares run
out of the wood, where I had shot
the fowl; still I felt I should need
more food soon, and there was some
in the ship which would be of great
use to me, and I must get it on shore
as quick as I could, for the sea was
so strong at times I knew the ship
could not stand long.
The next morn, when the tide
went out, I swam to the ship.
My raft was so large that I left
that on shore, and thought I would
make a small one when I got on the
ship. I did so, and then went to
look through the ship. I found two
or three bags full of nails and spikes,-
some saws and knives, and, to my
great joy, a stone to grind my tools
with.
I took all the men's clothes I could
find, a spare top sail, and a bed. I
put these on my raft, and brought
them all safe to the shore.
I found my things just as I had
left them. A wild cat was up on
one of the chests; my first thought
was to shoot her, but as she did not
seem to mind me, I threw a piece of
dry rusk at her, which she ate, and
then ran off.
I then went to work to make a
small tent of some kind, where I
could stay and sleep, as well as store
my goods in. I put up one with the
sail and some poles I had cut, and
brought in all my things that I
thought the sun or rain would spoil.
I then stood all the chests and casks
round it, and made a door of some
boards and a chest. When this was
done, I spread out my bed, put my
arms close by, and, for the first time
since I had left the ship, I laid down
and slept well.
For the next six days, when the
tide was low, I went out to the ship,
and thought that I had found all
that I would need, but as long as
the ship was there, I felt that I must
take off all that I could get.
In one of my trips I put so much
on my raft, that it went down, and
threw me and my goods into the sea,
but it did not do much harm, for I
took most of the things out.
One day I found some gold; I
said, "Oh drug! what art thou good
for? Thou art not worth as much
as one of the knives in this heap,"
I made up my mind to throw it in
the sea, but then I thought, I may
need this some time, so I put it up
in a piece of sail, and laid it by in
the tent.
The last trip I made the wind
blew hard, and drove me out from
the shore; I was in fear that I would
not reach it, but by hard work, and
the aid of the tide, I got on land all
safe, and I put up all my goods, for
I knew there would be a storm.
It blew hard all night, and the
next morn, when I woke, I saw that
the ship was gone. I felt sad, and
as though I had lost a friend, but I
knew that I had brought on shore
all that I could use now, and so I
soon gave up all thoughts of her.
As the spot my tent was on was not
a fit place for me to live, the ground
was so low and wet, I went out to
search the isle, to see if I could find
a dry place, from which I could view
the sea, or see when a ship came in
sight
I found a plain on the side of a
hill, with a large rock near by; a
hole was worn in the rock like a door
to a cave, and there was a flat green
in front of this hole. I thought I
could fix the place where the hole
was to put my food in, and I would
build my tent in front of it on the
green.
I went right to work. First I drove
two rows of large stakes (the space
of ten yards from the rock), so close
that they stood firm like piles, and
then with some of the rope I had,
I made the stakes tight, and then I
put some of the boards and planks
on to them, and in this way I made
a strong fence that would keep out
both man and beast.
I then built my tent, in fact two
of them, a small one first, with a large
one round it, and I put one of my
thick sails on the top of the large
one. The way into this place was
from the top, by means of a pair of
steps I had made, which I could pull
in with me when I went in. When
it was all done, I brought all my
goods and stores in here.
42
Chapter V.
I went out at least once a day
with my gun, to see what I could kill
that would be fit for food. One day
I saw some goats, but they were so
shy that it was hard work to get
near to them.
The first shot I made, I shot an
old goat with a small kid, that stood
near by, and when the old one fell,
the kid stood stock still, till I came
up to her. I felt so sad that I laid
the old dam down and took the kid
up in my arms to pet her, and I
thought if I could I would bring her
up and tame her, but she would not
eat, so I had to kill her.
The flesh of these two goats kept
me in food for a long time, for which
I was glad, as I did not want to eat
up all my bread, for though it was
dry and hard, I did not see how I
was to get more when this was gone.
In a few weeks more I found a
young kid that was lame, and I led
her by a string to my tent. I took
great care of her, and by the time
she was well, she was quite tame. I
soon had a chance to catch some
more, and it was not long when I
had quite a flock of goats, and all
the milk I could use.
My great thought, night and day,
was how should I live. What could
I do, way off here in this lone isle?
The tears would run down my face,
and I would say, "Oh! how I dread
this lone life." Then the thoughts
would come: "Well, you are here,
but where are the rest? Why is it
that you were not lost? Is it best to
be here or in the sea?" And I would
make up my mind to wait, and watch
for a ship, and that if I was to go
back home, it would be all in good
time.
As the days went by, I must make
a note of time, or I should lose sight
of the days and years, but I did not
know how to do it, for want of books,
pens, and ink; so with my knife I
made out of some posts a great
cross, and set it up near the shore.
I put on it, "I came here the first of
Sept., 165pr" and each day I cut a
notch, so I could tell the days of the
week, month, and year.
I did not have to lie in my bed
all the time. I had found a swing in
one of the rooms of the ship, which
had been the mate's, and in this I
would sleep in place of my bed.
I did not tell you of the two cats
that I brought in my arms from the
ship, nor of the dog who swam to
the shore with me at the same time.
The dog was a great pet, and a true
friend for years; he would hunt for
things and bring them to me; he
would do a great deal, but could not
talk. I thought, if he could but
speak to me and tell me his thoughts,
and I could tell him mine, how glad
I should be!
My tent was so small that I could
not get at half of my goods, which
lay in a heap on the floor; so I took
down the small one, and one side of
the large one, and built it out for a
long way, and then I had a chance
to look well at my goods.
In a box which I had brought
from one of the rooms in the ship,
I found what made my heart jump
for joy—a lot of blank books, pens,
and some ink. The ink I knew I
should have to use with great care,
for I could not make more when
this was gone, but I made up my
mind while I had it, I would write
down each night all that I saw, and
what took place through the day, as
well as the good and bad thoughts
of the day.
This gave me great peace of mind.
My book grew to be, to me, like a
friend I could talk to, and I soon
saw that we all have more cause for
joy than grief, if we will but look in
the right light at what is sent us, and
that I should be full of thanks to
God, who was so good to me, when
I had done so much that was wrong,
and left all at home, just to have my
own way.
The next thing now for me to do
was to make a chair to sit on, and a
stand to write and read by, as well
as to eat from. These I made out
of the short boards I had brought
on my raft from the ship. I could
not build much at a time, as I had
so few tools, When I was in need
of a board, I had to cut down a tree
and set it on edge by me, hew it flat
on both sides with my axe, and then
rub it smooth with my adze, and I
could make but one board from a tree.
When I had wrought out some
boards in this way I made some
large shelves, and put them up all
round on the sides of my tent. I
laid all my tools and nails, and such
goods as I could, on them, and hung
up my guns, and soon had my things
where I could get at them, and could
keep them and my tent neat and
clean.
Each day, when I was through
with my work, I would walk up to
the top of the hill, to see if there was
a ship or sail in sight, and when I
came back, would sit down and cry
like a child; my dog and cats would
come up to me and lick my hands,
and look at me in such a way as
though they would like to help me,
which would soothe me a great deal.
I wrote my notes for a year, and
then had to stop, as my ink gave out,
and I had no way to get more; but
those that I wrote were a great help
to me all the time I was on the isle.
One day I caught some wild birds,
a kind of dove, which I thought I
would tame. I did so, and their flesh
made good food. As time wore on,
I found I would need some more
lights, for when it was dark I had to
go to bed. I had some goats' fat,
which I made soft by the fire, and
then I made a wick to put in it from
a piece of old rope, and with the aid
of the sun to dry it, I made a small
dish of clay, and in this way I had
a lamp, and quite a good light.
I had some corn left, which was so
dry that I thought I could not use
it, but the bag would be good to
keep some of my things in; so I
threw the corn out on the ground.
o
In a few days the rains set in for a
month, and when they were through,
I saw one day a few green stalks;
they were quite small, and I did not
know what they were; but what was
my joy in a week's time, to find that
it was the corn which had sprung up;
and when that same day I took my
walk, I found on sides of the rock,
young stalks of rice, and a small
grain which grows quite thick in
some lands; but how it came here I
could not tell, for this was not the
right soil or place for it.

CHAPTER VI.
One day I was at work in my tent,
when I felt a great shock; the earth
shook so hard that I thought the top
of my tent would fall in; one of the
posts gave way, and I was in great
fear. I ran out to see what was the
cause of this. I found the ground
loose, and the dirt and stones thrown
up all round; then I knew it was
one of those shocks that I had
heard take place on the isles in the
South. The shock was just as strong
on the sea, for it threw the ship quite
high up on one end, near the shore.
When the shock came, I thought
that I would have to seek a new place
for my tent; but the sight of the
wreck drove these thoughts out of
my mind, for I felt that I must see
what I could bring from the wreck.
I knew I should need all I could find.
I went each day for a month. There
was not much in the ship that I could
use, as it had lain so long in the sea;
but with the aid of my axe and claw,
I brought back all the planks and
boards I could get loose.
On one of these trips, as I came
up the hill, I spied a great crab on
its back in the sun; I caught it, and
the eggs and flesh were to me the
best food I had had since I came on
the isle.
The rain came on for a few days,
and I felt cold, which I thought was
strange, as I ought not to feel cold
here, for as near as I could make out,
the isle was not far from the Line.
The next day I had a hard chill, and
then a great heat with faint sweats,
and for two weeks I was quite ill. I
was too ill to use my gun, and most
dead with thirst; I was too weak to
go out to get a drink, and as I lay
on my bed, my whole thought was,
"What shall I do?" All that I had
gone through had not made me pray
or think of God, as I should have
done. When I found the green corn,
I did think for a while that it was
one more proof of God's love, but my
heart was hard, and I soon let the
cares of each day take up my mind,
and did not stop to bless or thank
Him.
One night I had a strange dream:
I saw a great black cloud, and back
of it a bright flame, which shone on
the ground, and a man came out of
the cloud; his face shone like fire,
and he held a spear in his hand; the
earth shook and the air was full of fire.
The man said to me: "Thou wilt not
pray, nor turn and love me, now thou
shalt die;" and he took up his spear
as if he meant to kill me. I gave a
cry and a start, which woke me up.
This led me to think of my sins,
of my friends at home, and what they
had told me when a boy, and that it
was all my own self will that had
brought me here lone and sick; and
yet God had been so good to me to
save my life, and I thought, "He
sees and knows all things; He can
cure me; I will pray to Him and learn
to love Him."
The next day I was quite weak
and ill at ease; my fit did not come
on, but the dream was in my mind.
I made a search for that best of all
books, God's Word, and found it in
one of the chests. The first words
that I read were, "Call on me, I will
help thee;" and I knelt down and
sent up the cry, "Son of God, be with
me; help me to love Thee and teach
me to pray."
This was the first time since a child
that I knelt down to pray to God,
with a sense that He was near, and
that He would hear and help me.
My mind was now at ease, and that
night I laid down and slept well, and
when I woke the next morn I felt
quite well.
I read my book night and morn,
and I soon found that I had a dear
Friend, to whom I could go and get
peace.
I had heard when I was on my
farm, that to take the weed men
smoke, and put it in some rum to
steep, and then to drink the rum, it
would cure the chills; so I made
some of this, and took a dose of it
for a day or two, and it did work a
cure for me, as I was sick no more
while I was on the isle.
I thought of the shock that took
place, and when the rain was gone,
and I grew strong, I made up my
mind that it was best for me to make
a tour of the isle, and see if I could
find a good place where I could go in
case there should be more of them, as
well as to see what I could get to eat.
-
It is true I had the flesh of the
goats and birds, and the eggs of the
large crabs I found, but my bread
was gone, and I was sick of these.
I brought my raft on the shore,
out of the reach of the tide and
waves, and went on foot up the creek
for two miles, where I found that the
tide did not flow, and the sea ran in
a small brook, which was fresh and
clear, and on the banks of this brook
the grass grew thick and green.
There was a small ridge of hills
near here, and a fresh spring rose
out of the side of one of the hills, and
lime trees and grape vines grew on
all sides. The grapes were in their
prime, ripe and sweet.
In front of the hills there was a
smooth green plain, with plants and
fruit vines that ran on the ground,
The place had such a charm for me,
and it was so high up on the isle,
that I felt it would be a good spot
to stay and rest for a few days. I
thought it best to put up some sort of
a place to sleep in; I was still weak
and could not do much, but I built
a small hut of green brush and leaves.
The first night I did not sleep
well, I was so far from my tent, and
I thought of my pets and goods that
I had left there.
I spent two or three days here, and
then went back to my tent, where I
found all things safe. I took with
me all the fruit I could bear, and
hung the grapes in the sun to dry
them; and when I took them down
they were sweet and good, and I saw
that I could keep them for a long
time.
I found, by my post, that I had
been on the isle for one year, and had
seen no signs of a ship yet. I made
up my mind that I should have to
dwell here for a long time, and must
think of how I should live, and what
was best for me to do.
I thought I would like some bread,
but to have this I must have the
meal, and to get the meal I must
raise the corn and grain. But I had
no tools to work with; and how
could I do all this? I dug up the
ground with a spade I had made of
wood, as I had no plow, and took
the bough of a tree for a rake, and
with these I put in a part of the
corn, some rice, and the small grain,
a few stalks of which I had found
on the isle.
They did not yield much the first
year, as it was sown too late, and the
next year, the hares would tread it
down at night, and the birds would
eat it in the day time; I made a trap
to catch the birds and set my dog to
hunt the hares, and I put a hedge
all round the field, which kept out
my goats, and at the end of the third
year I had a good crop of all that
was sown.
My goats would stray off, and go
with the wild ones, and it took me
some time to hunt them up and tame
them, so I laid out a large piece of
ground to keep them in, and put a
thick hedge around it, and put up
small pens to drive them in; and at
w.rtiQHrtsf'
the end of a year and a half, I had a
flock of twelve goats, kids and all,
and in two years more, two score and
three. It took me three months to
plant my hedge and put up a pole
or fence by it, but this was a help to
me to pass my time, for the days
were long and drear.
You would smile were you to see
me and my pets sit down to dine.
First, there I was, prince and lord
of the whole isle, and Poll on the
back of my chair, and my dog at
my feet, with my cats on each side
of me, all on the watch lor the bits
that I would feed them from my
hands.
I did not have much time to sit
still through the day, for it could,
with truth, be said of me, "With the
sweat of thy face, shalt thou eat
bread;" but when the day's work
was done, I would sit in the door of
my tent, with my dog on one side
of me, the cats at my feet, and Poll
on my hand.
Poll was a young bird I had
caught, and I took a great deal of
pains to teach her to talk, and the
first time she spoke her name, it gave
me a great start, I had hot heard a
voice but my own for so long.
As I now had so much corn and
rice, I thought of my bread.
I sat one day for a long time to
think how I should grind my corn
and bake my bread. First, I must
have some pots or jars to keep my
meal in. I thought of my clay
lamp, and went to work to make
a sort of paste with the clay and
sand that was on the beach. You
would laugh were I to tell you the
ways I took to make this paste, and
what odd things I made; how some
of them fell in and some fell out,
and some would crack with the heat
of the sun, but I kept on, and at
last, with the aid of the sun to bake
them, I had two large pots to keep
my meal in.
Though these were quite dry and
hard, I saw that they were not strong.
I could not bake or cook in them,
nor use them for half of my things.
One day a piece fell in the fire, and
when I took it out I found it was
burnt as hard as a stone, and as red
as a tile. I now made up my mind
to-»burn all my pots, and in a few
weeks I had a nice lot of large jars,
round pots, and a flat dish. How
glad I was, now I could bake bread,
boil meat, and make some broth.
I now sought the means to grind
my corn and grain for meal. I had
no mill, so I thought I would stamp
or beat it out. I spent a great deal
of time to find a stone, but as I could
not get one, I took a great "block of
hard wood, and with my axe and
knife cut a deep hole in it. I put my
grain in this hole, and with a short,
thick piece of wood beat it out fine.
The next thing was a sieve to dress
my meal, and part it from the bran
and husk. I had no goat's hair, nor
could I weave it if I had. This put
a stop to my work for some weeks;
but one day I found a piece of thin
cloth (such as men wear round their
necks for ties), which I had brought
from the ship. With this I made
three small sieves, and these I made
last for some years.
Now that my grain was ground,
and I had meal, I could make bread,
but how was I to bake it? I had
made some square red tiles, and put
them all round my fire, like a hearth;
I built a large fire, and when it was
all burnt up to live coals, I drew
them out on the tiles, and put my
dough in a broad flat dish, and set it
s
on the hot tiles, and in a short time
I had a nice loaf of bread. I now
had all the fresh bread and rice cakes
I could eat.
I had now been on the isle four
years, and still no ship came by. I
could see a piece of land some way
off from the isle, and each day I
would look at it and long to go on
it, and see what there was there; but
fear of the wild men, that I thought
might live there, kept me back. If
Xury were with me, was now my
great wish; how much he could help
me! or if I had a boat, I could do so
well.
I thought I would go and look at
our ship's boat, which had been blown
up on the shore, a great way off. I
found that she lay up in such a way
that I could not turn her; and I saw
that I would have to do so much to
her, that it would be best for me to
make a new one. To do this, I cut
down a large tree, and took the trunk
and made it in shape with my axe
and adze.
I did not stop to think how I
should get it to the sea. I thought,
"Let me first make it and I will find
a way." It took me three months of
toil to do this, but I did not mind
that. I was full of hope, and thought
what a good time I should have,
and how I would sail off in it.
When it was hewn out, fit for me
to launch, it was so large, that do all
I would, I could not move it. I
thought I would dig a trench round
it, and see if I could slide it out to
sea, but it was of no use; so I left it
to go back to work on my farm, and
I felt that I must make up my mind
to end my days here.
I had large flocks of goats, good
crops of corn and grain, in fact all
that I could eat, and the means to
cook with. The most I stood in need
of now was clothes. I had worn out
all that I had brought from the ship,
and I was now in rags. When I
would kill a goat or kid, I would
save the skin, and hang it in the
sun to dry, and in this way I had
quite a large stock of nice skins.
The first thing I made of these was
a great cap for my head, and I made
this so well, that I made a whole
suit. I put the hair of the skin out,
so that it would shed the rain. The
coat was long and loose, and made
fast to the waist with a belt.
The next thing to make was a sort
of shade, to take with me when I
went out, to shield me from the sun
and rain. I made a frame and put
a skin on it, but though I could
make it spread, I had hard work to
make it let down; but I did it at
last, and found it of great use to
me.
If you could have seen me when
I went out to walk, you would say
that I had no need to be vain, and
that I did not have to use a glass to
fix my clothes, but they were the
best I could get.
One year more went by, and this
I think was one of the best ones I
spent on the isle. I had been well
all the time, and grew strong; my
crops were fine, my pets were all
round me, and I had time to read
God's Word night and morn; but
with these I could not keep my
thoughts from a boat, and I went to
work to make a small one. The last
one was in my mind, and I took
great care to build this one the
right size, and not too far from the
edge of the sea.
When it was done, I put a mast
and sail on it, and made a place to
stow my arms and food in. I put
my shade on One end to shield me
from the hot sun. I took a short
sail out, and I had such a good time
that I thought in a few days I would
take a long sail. So one morn, I
put my gun and some food with a
case of rum in the boat, and set out
to view the isle, and see all that lay
round it. This was in the sixth
year of my reign on the isle.
CHAPTER VIII.
When I had been out three days,
a great gale came up and drove me
out to sea, and I thought that I with
my boat would be lost. The fourth
day the wind went down some, and
I put on all my sail, and the wind
and tide took me up on the end of
the isle a great way from home.
Here I left the boat, and had to walk
home; and when I came to my place,
I was so worn out that I laid down
in the shade of one of my trees and
fell in a deep sleep.
You may judge of my fright when
I was woke from my sleep by a voice
that said, "Who are you?" "Where
have you been?"
At first I thought I was in a
dream; but when I saw Poll on the
top of the hedge, I knew it was her
voice I heard. These were some of
the words I had taught her, to cheer
me when I was sad.
For some time I kept at home,
but one day I thought I would walk
down and take a look at the boat.
When quite near it I saw the print
of a man's foot in the sand—toes, heel,
and all parts of a foot. I went up
and down the shore, but saw no one.
I went back to my tent as fast as
I could. I could not sleep that
night, and for three days kept close
in doors, but the want of food drove
me out. I took a look all round,
and as I saw no one, I thought the
mark I had seen might be the print
of my own foot which I had left
there at some time, but still I could
not get rid of my fear.
How queer men are! to-day we
love, the next day we hate. Had
not all my grief been that I was here,
with no friends, none to talk to but
my pets? And now when I thought
a man might be near, why should I
shake with fear?
One morn as I took up my book
to read, I saw the words, "Wait on
the Lord, be of good cheer, I will
give thee strength; wait, I say, on
the Lord." I thought of these words
for some time, and then I knelt down
to pray God to take care* of me and
give me peace.
I felt that I must fix my tent as
well as my goods and flocks in a
more safe way than they were. I
made some holes in the ground some
way off from my hedge, and drove
large posts in them, and with old
boards and planks I built a high
wall; and a short way from this, I set
out some young trees, which I knew
would grow fast, and at the end of
two years I had a thick grove all
round, which hid my place from
view.
Two or three years more went by
and I saw no signs of men, and
thought that the print of a man's foot
was not so great a thing, and that I
had been weak to feel so much fear.
I now felt at ease, and would take
short sails in my boat, and take walks
on the shore.
One day I went up to the top of
a hill to look at the sea; I thought I
saw a boat, but it was so far off that
it did not look like more than a speck,
but as I did not have a glass with
me could not make it out. I went
on down the hill to a part of the isle
where I had not been, when I saw
close to the edge of the shore, a pit
where there had been a fire made,
and all round were strewn skulls,
hands and feet, and burnt bones of
men.
At the sight of these I grew sick,
and went up the hill with all the
speed I could, and when I came to
my tent burst in a flood of tears.
This was the first true sign of men.
But what kind of men, I thought—
a wild set, that will eat me up if they
find me. My whole mind, by night
as well as day, was how shall I get
rid of them? But what could I do
with two or three score of them,
with their darts and bows, with
which they could shoot as true to a
mark as I could with my gun? I
thought of my gun dust, and that
I might blow them up; in fact, I
thought of all sorts of ways, but none
of them would do. The best thing
for me to do was to load my gun,
and stay at home and watch.
I took my boat up in a safe place,
and brought sail and masts, with all
the things that were in her, home to
my tent, so that if they came they
could not take them off. I kept on
the watch for them all the time, and
each day would go up to the top of
the hill to see if they were there, but
did not see them, nor a sign of them,
for a long while, as I. will show
you.
I thought if a ship would come
that way, then there would be help
for me. But none came. I did not
dare to drive a nail, or chop a stick,
for fear of the noise, or make a fire
for fear the wild men would see the
smoke.
I had more care of my life now
than for my food; but I soon found
that to live I must eat, and I must
bake my bread and cook my meat.
So I went in the wood to cut down
some small trees (to make a fire
of), and while I was there I saw
back of a thick branch of low brush
a large hole, and in this hole two
large bright things like eyes, which
sent a flash on me. I took up a
small stick of wood that was on fire,
and went to see what it was. As I
came up I heard a sigh, and then a
slight noise. This put me in a cold
sweat, but I went on, and when I
came close to the hole I saw that it
was an old goat that had gone in
there to die. I found the hole to be
the mouth of a cave. Just then my
fire went out, and the place was so
low that I thought I would not go
in then, but wait till the next day.
The next morn I took six lights
with me and went to the cave. I
had to creep in, on my hands and
knees, through a sort of strait for ten
feet. When I got through this, I
saw that the roof rose up high, and
that I could stand up; and what a
grand sight now met my view!
When I threw my lights round, the
roof and sides shone like gems, gold
and bright stars. I stood for some
time lost in thought.
I had been on the isle for so long,
and this was the first I knew of this
strange and great place, and yet it
was so near my tent! Where could
I find more proof of God's might
and care than this? The cave was
twelve feet wide, and quite dry, and
I thought this would be a safe place
for me. It would hold all my arms,
gun dust, and such things as I would
need; and the mouth was so small
that the wild men would not think
to look in for me, and if they did,
would have to come one at a time,
and I could get rid of them by use
of my arms. I took care to bring
in all I might want as soon as I
could, and felt that I had found a
safe place to hide in, and I could
live there for some time.
Now for the first time I thought
how dear to me were all the'things
round me. My Polls, for I had two
or three, would call me by name as
soon as I came in; my dog and cats
would bark and purr round me; my
tame birds would light on my head
and back, and I had no fears for want
of food and drink. All would have
been peace with me if it had not been
for my great dread of the wild men.
And must I now give up all to them
and die? No! that I would not do
if I could help it. I made up my
mind that if the wild men came I
would flee to my cave, and do all
that I could to save my life. So I
went back to my work on the farm
and the care of my flocks; and felt
that God, who had done so much for
me, would help and save me.
In a few months from this time
my good old dog fell dead, right
near the door of my tent. This
made me feel sad for a long time.
6
In this way five or six more years
went by, and I saw no more signs
of the men, and I thought it might
have been mere chance that had
brought them on the isle, and that I
had done wrong to fret so much;
but one day, on my way home from
my walk up the hill, I saw a smoke,
and as near as I could judge two
miles down, and this time on my
side of the isle.
I ran back to the top of the hill,
and laid down flat, and took a good
look at the place where it came from.
I saw that there was quite a large
fire, with nine men round it. I could
not tell just what they were at; but
tHought, no doubt, the fire was to
cook the food they had brought with
them. There were two small boats
on the edge of the shore, in which
they had come. As soon as the tide
Went out, they all got in the boats
and went off.
I went down to the spot, and saw
from the bones and skulls that lay all
round, that they had come here to
have one of their feasts. I went
back to my farm, and took up all
that grew round my place that would
lead them to think I was there, and
made it look as wild as I could. I
took in my steps, and I then sat
down in my tent to think what I
should do. I knew that the time
had come for me to act. I grew
bold, and felt that I must get rid of
them. I would watch for them, and
if they came and found me, I would
fight them off. I took two of my
guns, and put them through some
holes I made in the fence, and kept
them so I could fire on them as soon
as they came up.
Of course, for a long time I did not
do much on my farm. I had food,
and my goats gave me all the milk I
could drink, and I kept close watch
for near a year for the men.
One night in the spring the wind
blew hard, and I knew we should
have a storm. I put up all my things
for the night, took in my guns, and
sat down in my tent to read God's
Word, when I heard a gun, and in
a short time I heard it once more.
This I knew was not the wild men,
but thought that it came from some
ship at sea which was in need of
aid.
I ran to the top of the hill, in hopes
that if it were so I could see them,
or they could see me, and I built a
large fire, as a sign for them; but the
wind blew so that it was hard to keep
my fire up, and it was so dark that I
could not see a thing; but I kept
on as well as I could till the next
morn, when to my great grief I saw
that it was a ship which had struck
on the same sand where our ship
had been lost. I could not tell if
there were men in it or not. Now
for the first time in years I got my
boat down, and put the mast and
sail in it, and as much food and
drink as I thought I would need,
and put my large shade in one end,
and then set sail for the ship.
I did not think of the wild men.
All my hope now was to see if I
could save the lives of some of those
who might be on board; and so
great was this hope, that I could
scarce wait to reach the ship. To
hear and speak to a man of my own
kind was the great wish of my heart.
In less than two hours I came up to
it; but all was still. A dog that
was on deck was all that was left in
the ship that had life. He came at
me with a cry and bark, and was
most dead for food and drink. I
gave him some bread, and a drink
from a jar I had with me, and then
I put him in my boat. The wind
and force of the waves had torn the
ship's sails, and the ship had struck
the sand in such a way, it was most
split in two.
I went down to search the rooms,
and found in one of them two dead
men, but the rest were gone. My
thought was, where? Had they
gone off in a small boat and found a
safe place, or had they gone down
in the sea? In one of the rooms there
were three large chests, some clothes,
but not much that would be of use to
me, as most of the goods and stores
were spoilt by the sea. There were
some large casks of wine and rum
down in the hold of the ship, but
they were too large for me to lift;
but I found two chests, a good spy
glass, three large flasks, a pair of
tongs, a small pot, and some good
shirts. I put all these in my boat.
From all that I saw, I knew that the
ship had a great deal of wealth on
board, and I think was bound for
some place on the southwest coast
to get gems.
I now went back to the isle. I
had been gone three days, but I
found all my things as I had left
them, that is, my goats, cats and
birds.
When I came to look in the chests
I found in one of them three large
bags of gold; but what good was
that to me? I would give it for
some good shoes or socks, or some
seeds from home; but I laid it by
with the rest I had, in hopes that at
some time it might help me to get
home, or aid me when I was there.
I had been here a score and four
years, and most of the time had been
spent in peace, and I had made up
my mind to stay and die here. My
farm and pets had kept me at work
most of the time, and, as I have said,
if it had not been for the few times
the wild men came, I should have
felt that I had more cause for joy
than some men in my own land.
But the sight of the wreck and men
of my own kind wrought a great
change in me. I would sit and
think of the wild men, that if they
came, they would kill me; then I
would look at the wreck, and I
said: "Here was a ship that had
come near the shore, and why might
there not more come?" I could
not work. I lost my faith and trust.
I thought I would take my boat and
go out to sea, and that by chance I
might drift out in way of some ship
that would take me in.
For a year and a half I was full of
these wild thoughts, and I would go
out and watch by the hour, for both
the wild men and a ship. I did not
do much else but cook my food, milk
my goats, and feed my flocks and pets.
I had corn, rice, grain, and fruit, that
I knew would last for some time.
One morn, I went out to see to
my boat, when I saw five small boats
on the shore, quite close by, and near
them full three score black men.
I ran home and put up all my
things as safe as I could, and stuck
my axe and sword in my belt, took
my gun and my glass, and went up
to the top of the hill to watch them.
I saw that they had a fire and some
kind of meat, but I could not tell
what it was. They all sat down as
I thought to eat it.
Chapter X.
When they were through, I saw
some of them get up and dance in
their way round the fire, while some
went off; they soon came back, and
brought with them two slaves, bound
hand and foot. They took off their
bands, and left one to stand while
they went to work to cut one up.
When the first one found he was
free, he ran off, and straight in the
road to my house. When the rest
saw him run, they all gave full chase.
This put me in a great fright, for
I did not want them to reach my
place. I went down to my tent,
with all the speed I could, and got
one more gun. I thought "I will
try to save the poor man if I can."
There was a small creek through
which he would have to swim to
reach me, and I went down to it. I
found that all but two had gone
back (as the rest could not swim),
and the poor slave was quite close to
me. I did not like to fire, for I did
not want the rest to hear; so I made
a sign to the slave to come up to me,
and then I went up to the men. The
first one I gave a hard knock with
the end of my gun, and he fell as
though dead at my feet. The one
that was left then took aim at me
with his bow, and to save my own
life I had to fire. I shot him dead.
The fire and noise of my gun gave
the poor slave such a fright that he
could not move, and I thought he
might get back in their hands; so I
made signs to him to come to me,
and that I would not hurt him. He
came to me and knelt down and
gave the ground a kiss, and then
took my feet in his hands, and gave
them a kiss, to let me know that he
would be my slave. The man that
I thought was dead now rose up.
I saw that he was not much hurt,
but would soon get up on his feet;
when the slave made a sign that he
would like to cut off his head. I
gave him my sword, and he ran up
to him and cut off his head as quick
as a flash, and brought it to me and
put it down on the ground by me,
with a laugh. I did not like this,
for I thought my life was not safe
with such a man. When this was
done, he made a hole in the sand
with his hands, and put the two men
in it, so that the rest could not see
them if they should come back.
I now told him by signs to come
with me, and we went to my place.
I did not care to take him to my
tent, but went with him to my cave.
Here I made a bed of rice straw
for him, and then gave him some
food and drink, when he laid down
and went to sleep.
I could now take a good look at
him. I saw that he was well made,
tall and good shape, with straight
strong limbs. His hair was long
and black, but did not curl; he had
a small nose, a good mouth, with
thin lips, and firm, white, well set
teeth. His skin was not as black as
the men that came with him, but
more of a light brown; and as he lay
there his face wore a sweet smile.
I went out to milk my goats, and
put up some things for the night, and
while I was at this he woke up, and
came out to me, and made all sorts
of signs that he would like to wait
on me; and at last he lay his head
down flat on the ground close by my
feet, and took one of them in his
hand and laid it on his head, and
made a sign to me that he would
serve me as long as he should live.
I let him know that I was glad, and
then I taught him a few words and
my name. I could not tell what his
name was; but I thought I would
call him from the name of the day
on which I had found him, which was
Friday. I took a great deal of pains
to make him know what I meant. I
sent him back to the cave, and I
slept there with him all night.
The next morn I led him up to
the top of the hill, to see if the men
had come back; but there were no
signs of them, and we went back to
my tent, where I got three guns,
some shot, a bow and a sword. I
gave Friday some of these to take
with him, and we went to the spot
where the men had been. I saw
three skulls, five hands, the bones of
three or four feet and legs, and a lot
of small bones. I told Friday to
pick them all up, and lay them in
a heap, and set fire to them and
burn them up, and I made signs
to him that he must not eat the flesh
of men; if he did I would shoot him.
When we had done this I went back
to my tent, and I went to work to see
if I could make him some clothes.
I found some things in one of the
chests, and I made him a goat skin
coat and a hare skin cap. At first
he said they hurt him, and that he
could not walk in them, and he went
round ill at ease; but in a few days
he said they were nice and all right,
and was quite proud to think his
clothes were as good as mine.
7
For some time 1 did not feel quite
sure in my mind, that I could trust
my life with Friday, and took all
sort of means to fix my tent up safe;
but there was no use for this, for I
found him full of love and true to
me, and that he would give up his
life for me, as I will show you by
and by.
I soon found that, to cure Friday of
his taste for men's flesh, he must have
some kind of meat, and I thought I
would teach him to kill and dress
game for both him and me. One
day I took him out to shoot and
hunt with me. It hought I would
kill a kid of my own flock and dress
it, but as we went to the wood, I saw
an old goat with two kids. I caught
hold of Friday, and said, "Stand
still," and made signs to him not to
stir. I took up my gun, and shot one
of the kids. Poor Friday did not
know what to do; he shook life a leaf
in the wind, and I thought he would
sink to the ground. He came up to
me and knelt down by me, as if to
pray to me not to kill him. I saw
that I must find a way to show him
that I would do him no harm. I
took him up by the hand and told
him to bring me the kid, and in a
short time I saw a bird, and I made
signs to him that I would shoot it
and it would fall. I did so. This
made Friday stand and look for a
long time. I told him to pick it up;
he took it in his hand, and then gave
it to me; he had such a queer look
on his face, as if to say, "Well, if
you will not kill me, that thing you
have there will do it." He would
not touch the gun for some days, but
would go up to it and talk to it, and
pray to it not to kill him. In a few
weeks this fear wore off, and he would
take the gun and go out to shoot and
hunt as well as I did.
Chapter XI.
When we got home I made some
broth of a part of the kid, and took
the rest to roast; and when I had
fed Friday with the meat and broth,
he made signs to me that he thought
it was good, and that he would eat
man's flesh no more, which I was
glad to hear. He would not eat
salt with his food, but would make
a face as if he were sick when he saw
me eat it.
The next day I set him to work
to beat and sift some corn for me,
and then I let him see me make my
bread and bake it ; and in a few
weeks Friday could do all my work
as well as I could.
As I had now two mouths to feed
I knew I would have to raise more
grain, and this would make more
work on my farm. I told Friday
he must help, which he was glad to
do, for his whole mind was, what
he could do to show his love for me.
What joy there was now for me!
Here was some one I could teach
and talk to; no more of those lone
drear hours for me. I thought I
would like to know how he came to
be with those men, and if he would
like to go back to his own land; so I
said to him:
"How is it that you were in the
hands of those men that brought you
here?"
F. "There was a great fight with
their tribe and my tribe, and my
king had to give up, and they take
me with a lot more men, and make
us slaves and bring us here to eat
us up."
R. "Could not your tribe fight
and beat them?"
F. "Yes, yes, we fight the best;
but they more than my tribe in the
place where me was."
R. "But why did not your tribe
get you from their hands then?"
F. "They run one, two, three and
me, and make me go in the boat.
My tribe have no boat at that
time."
R. "Well, Friday, what does
your tribe do with the men they
take? Do they take and eat them
as these did?"
F. "Yes, my tribe eats mans too;
eat all up."
R. "Where do they take them?"
F. "Go to place where they think."
R. "Do they come here?"
F. "Yes, they come here; come
else place too."
R. "Have you been here with
them?"
F. "Yes, I been here" (and points
to the N. W. side of the isle, which
it seems was their side).
He then told me that a great way
back of the moon (he meant in the
west), there were white men, and
that I might go to them if I had
"two boat." At first I did not
know what he meant, but found that
he meant a ship as large as two
boats. This was good news for me,
and I made up my mind that, with
Friday's help, I would make a large
ship, and try once more to get off.
I thought I would like to know
who the tribes were that he spoke
of; but all I could get out of him
was "Cribs," by which I knew he
meant those tribes that dwell on the
large isles which lie south of that
great land east of my own.
One day I thought I would teach
him who the true God was. I said
to him: "Do you know who made
you, the sea, land, moon and stars?"
He said it was an old, old man, who
was old when the sun, moon, sea and
land were made.
I said to him: "If this old man
made all things, why do not all things
pray to him?"
With a grave look, he said: "All
things say O! to him."
I. then said: "Where do the men
who die in your land go to?"
He said "To the old man."
"And do those you eat up go
there too?"
He said "Yes."
I then told him of God, how He
made and took care of us, and sent
His Son to die for us, and teach us
to pray, and that He could, hear
us way up in the sky, and that
He would keep us from the bad
one, who made us think and do
wrong.
He said that if God could hear so
far off, He had more might and could
do more than the old man; and if He
was so strong and had so much
might, why did He not kill the bad
one who was the cause of so much
sin?
At this I could not say a word;
but felt that I must pray to God to
help me bring this dark soul in the
right way to Him. I had the sure
guide to bliss, that is the Word of
God, and this I read with great care
to him night and morn, and while I
did so, I found peace for us both.
I told him of a part of my life, and
how I had been cast on the isle, and
of our ship; and one day I took him
to the wreck of the ship. He stood for
a long while, as if in deep thought, and
then said: "Me see such boat like
come to place at my tribe;" and now
for the first time I thought that the
white men, from the ship that was
lost, might have gone to his place,
and I said to him: "Were there
white men in the boat?" He said,
with some warmth, "Yes, the boat
full of white mans. We save the
white mans from drown." Said I:
"Where are they now?" He told
me "They live, they dwell at my
tribe." "Well, how did it come that
you did not kill and eat them?" He
said: "We no eats mans but when
they make war fight;" by which he
meant such as come to fight with
them.
One day when we were on the
top of a hill on the east side of the
isle, Friday gave a loud cry—" Oh
joy! Oh glad! There see my land;
there my friends!" "Do you wish
to be back in your own land?" I
said to him. "Yes, I be much O
glad to be at my own tribe."
"What would you do there?" said
I. "Would you turn wild and eat
man's flesh as you did once?"
With a shake of his head, he said:
"No, no! Friday tell them to live
good; tell them to pray God; tell
them eat bread, drink milk; no eat
man more."
"Why, then," said I, "they will
kill you."
With a grave look, he said: "No,
no! they no kill me; they will love to
learn."
I then said to him: "Will you go
back to them?"
He said, with a smile, that he
could not swim so far. I told him I
would make a boat for him.
He said he would go if I would
go with him.
"I go!" says I. "Why, they will
eat me if I go there."
"No, no!" says he; "me make
them no eat you; me make them
much love you." The next day I
took him to see the boat, and when
he got in I saw he was quick, and
could make it go as swift as I could.
He said the boat was too small to
go to his land, and I told him that I
would make him a big boat, and he
could go home to his tribe. He
gave me a deep, sad look, and then
took his axe from his belt and told
me to kill him.
"What must I kill you for?" I
said.
"Why you mad at me? Why
you send Friday off? You go with
Friday."
"What will I do there?"
"You teach them know God, pray
God, live new life; you teach wild
mans be good, like you teach me."
I saw that he was true and meant
all he said, and that I did not need
more proof of his love; so I told
him that he should stay with me,
and that when he went I would go
with him.
This made him glad, and my own
mind was at ease.
From this time my mind was made
up to build a large boat, and to go
with him to see if I could find the
white men he spoke of.
Chapter XII.
Friday and I went to see if we
could find a large tree that we could
cut down and get near to the shore,
so that we could launch our boat
when it was done; for I thought of
the one I had made and could not
use.
We found one that Friday thought
would do. It was a strange kind of
wood to me, but hard and strong-.
We both took a great deal of pains
to make it. The most of it was
hewn in shape with my axe, and when
it was done it took us two weeks to
roll it to the sea. Friday cut down
a tall fir tree, which I made a mast
of, and I put two sails in it, which I
made as well as I could from the old
ones I had left; and a place to stow
my arms and food in. When I was
through I felt quite proud of it. It
was good shape, large, and I had
no doubt but that it would sail
well.
-As it was most time for the great
rains to come on, I thought it best
not to go to sea till they were
through; so we brought the ship
up the creek, out of the way of the
tide of the sea; and to keep her dry,
we put boughs of trees on her, which
made a sort of roof, and I made
Friday dig a small dock for her, so
that she could just float round.
For the next two months we had
to stay in doors most of the time.
I found Friday to be a great help to
me. He would feed my pets, take
care of my flocks, milk goats, cook
my food and spread my meals, and,
best of all, could sit and talk with
me. In this way we spent our days
till the rain was gone, and then we
went to get the ship, to fit her up and
go to sea.
One day I sent Friday to the shore
to see if he could find one of those
large crabs, for the sake of the eggs
(as well as the flesh), which I thought
would be nice to take with us. He
had not been gone long when I
saw him on the run, and heard him
cry: "O sir! O sir! O sad! O
bad!"
When he came up to me I said:
"What is it, Friday?"
"Oh! there one, two, three boats!
one, two, three!"
I thought he meant six boats, but
soon saw there were but three of
them.
Poor Friday shook so hard, and
was so full of fear that they had come
to take him back, and that they would
kill him and eat him up, that it took
me some time to soothe him. I told
him not to mind them; but that he
must do just as I told him to, and
said;
"We can fight them, Friday."
He said: "Yes; me shoot."
''Will you stand by me, Friday,
and do as I bid you?"
He said: "Me die when you bid
me die."
I went and got some rum, and gave
him a good drink of it to cheer him
up, and then I made him take the
two large guns and load them with
large swan shot, while I took two
small guns, a bag of fine shot, and I
stuck my knife in my belt, and hung
my great sword by my side. I took
my glass and went up on the side of
the hill, and from there I saw that
there were three boats, and more than
a score of men, who had just come
on land, and brought with them
three men bound hand and foot,
and that they had come to hold one
of their feasts.
I made up my mind I would put
a stop to this, and would go down
and shoot them all. I told Friday
to come and keep close to me, and
not to shoot till I bid him, and by
no means to speak a word.
As I went down the hill, the
thought came to me: "What right
have I to shed blood, or dip my
hands in the blood of these men, who
have done me no harm?'' To be
sure, Friday might feel they were his
foes, and I could not blame him if he
felt that he must kill them; but had
not God made them as well as me?
and did He not put them here on
earth in their wild state? and had I
a right to go and kill them, or was it
right for me to judge them? So I
thought, I will go down near them
and watch them; and if I find they
will not do me nor my place any
harm, I will act then as God will
guide me.
When I came to the skirt of the
wood, on the side which was next to
them, I told Friday in a low tone to
go to a large tree and look, and bring
me word if he could see what they
were at.
He came back and said that they
had made a fire, and had the three
bound men close by; that one of
them was a white man, and he knew
they meant to kill and eat them; in
fact, he thought that one of them
was dead. When I heard that they
had a white man, it made my head
swim, and I was full of rage; so I
went to a place near by, where I
could see all they did, and found
that they had sent two of their men
to kill the white man, and would
soon cook and eat him up like the
rest.
I knew that I had no time to lose.
I said to Friday: "Do as I bid you,
and just as you see me do. Do not
fail."
He said "Yes," and when I gave
the word "fire," he shot at them the
same time I did.
The men ran in all sorts of ways,
to the right and to the left, with
loud yells and cries of fright, and
went for their boats. At this I
ran out of the wood, with Friday
close to my heels. I gave a loud
shout and bade Friday do the same,
and then Friday and I shot at
them once more. I thought we had
shot them all, for they all fell down
in a heap in the boat; but in a short
time two of them got up and came
on shore, when Friday made a rush
at them, at which they took to their
heels, and were soon with all the
rest far out to sea.
While Friday went to fight them,
I went up to the poor white man,
and cut with my knife the bands that
bound him, and told him to get up;
but he was too weak to speak or
stand. I took out my flask and gave
him a drink, and a cake of corn
bread to eat, which gave him some
strength, and he sat up and made
signs to show me that he must in.
some way thank me for what I had
done. I told him not to mind that
now, but to try and get up, and I
would take him home with me.
While I was with this man Friday
went to look at a poor wretch, who
lay bound in a boat the men had left
in their fright to get off He cut the
bands that bound him, at which he
gave a groan, for he thought Friday
was one of the men who had come
to kill him. When I heard him
groan I left the white man (who by
this time could sit up and talk), and
went to see what I could do for the
poor black man. I gave him a large
dram of rum, which, when he had
drank it, made him come to, and he
sat up in the boat and spoke to
me.
When Friday heard him speak
and saw his face, he took him in his
arms and gave him a hug and a kiss;
and then he wrung his hands and
beat his own face and head like a
mad man. It made me shed tears
to see him laugh, and sing and
dance round him. I said to him:
"What ails you? Who is it?" For
a long while he did not speak, and
then told me that he was this man's
son.
Now that these poor men were
free, and it was quite late in the
day, I thought we must get them to
our tent. They were so stiff and
sore that they could not move,
so I gave Friday some rum to
rub their arms and hands and feet
with.
I said to Friday: "Did you give
this man some bread?"
He said: "None, bad dog, eat all
up self."
I gave him some cakes of bread
I had with me, and I saw Friday
run off as swift as a deer, and I
could not think where he had gone;
but in a short time he came back
with a jug, that he had gone way back
to our farm for, that he might give the
poor old man a fresh drink from our
spring. We all took a drink, and
the men by this time were quite at
ease; but as they could not walk,
Friday and I made a sort of hand
chair, and took them to my place.
But when we came there we found
that we could not get them in my
tent, for they could not climb my
steps; and as they must have a good
place to rest in for the night, Friday
and I made a small tent with some
poles, and put old sails on the top,
and then made two nice beds of rice
straw for them to he on.
I sent Friday down for our arms,
and all the things that we had left
on the shore, and in the mean time
I cut up a young kid and went to
work to boil or stew some of it; and
I made them both a good dish of
broth, with some rice in it.

Chapter XIII.
Friday soon came back with the
things I had sent him for, and we
had our meal; and then I told him
to put the men to bed, and stay with
them for the night, for they might
want him. He did so, and I sat for
a long time in the door of my tent
to think. I felt quite like a king.
Was I not lord of all here? and here
are all my men, three whom I think
would serve me, and if need be lay
down their lives for me.
The next morn I had a good long
talk with the men, and the white
man, who I shall call Frank, told
me that he had come from Spain, and
that he, with some more men, had
been in the ship that was lost, and
they went in the small boat to the
main land, where they found naught
but wild men; and as they could not
get off from them, they had made
them (the white men) their slaves,
and when they were in want of a
feast, they would come on the isle and
bring a man or two with them, and
cut them up; and they had brought
him with two of their own kind to
do the same to them.
The old man had such a queer
name that I thought I would call
him Jack. I thought we had best
be on the watch for the wild men,
for fear that they would come back
with some more of their own men,
and try to kill us; but Jack thought
we would see them no more, for they
had had such a fright at the noise
and fire of our arms, that they would
think we were some kind of sprites
that had come down from the sky
to kill them.
I found Jack could talk quite
well, as the white men had been
with him for some time, and as they
were all kept as slaves, had made
friends of them.
Frank said, that he thought if we
went to the place where they had
come from, the rest of the white men
that were there would be glad to
come back with me and serve me.
They had not had a chance to get
off, for they had no arms or tools to
work with, and I thought we ought
to go right off for them; but Frank
said, "Wait, my friend, you have
now two more to feed, and it will not
be right to bring more men here, till
you have more to feed them with,
else we may all starve.
So I went to work first to make
my tent and caves more safe, and
then Frank and I with the two black
men did naught for a year and a
half but work on my farm, and when
I felt that I had what would keep us
all, or that we could raise it, I sent
Frank and Jack out on a boat, to
see if they could find them and bring
them back to me.
They had been gone eight days,
when one morn, Friday came in the
tent to me and said, " O ! sir, they
are come, they are come!" and I
thought our men had come, and ran
out with all the speed I could to
meet them, but I soon found that it
was a strange ship, and not on my
side of the isle.
I thought I had best watch them
for a while; so I stood still, and I
saw them put out a long boat, and
put three men that were bound in
it, and then five men got in and they
all came to the shore.
Friday said, "O ! sir, you see
white mens eat men, as well as wild
men."
"Why," said I, "do you think they
will eat them all?"
"Oh ! yes, they will eat them."
"No, No, Friday, I think they
will kill them, but you may be sure
they will not eat them."
When they had all got up on the
land, I saw one of the men raise his
sword to strike one of the bound
men, who hung his head, as if he
would let him do what he would, and
then he did the same to the rest, and
then set them free.
The five men then went to the
boat, but the tide was so low, they
could not get her off the sand; so
they sat down near by, to wait for
the tide to come in, and the three
men who had been bound, went off
a short way and laid down in the
shade of a tree.
I now went to my tent, took all
the arms I thought Friday and I
could use, and went back to the men
on the ground, and said to them,
"Sirs, why are you here, and who
are you?"
When they heard my voice, they
all gave a start, and I thought they
would all flee in the woods.
I said "Do not fear; I am a friend
who has come to help you."
"Did you drop down from the
sky, and are you man or God?" said
one of them with a grave look.
"A God would not be apt to come
in these clothes," said I, "but all help
is from the Lord. Tell me your case,
and I will see if I can give you aid.
You see that my man and I have
arms, and we will do what we can to
serve you."
One man spoke, and said: "Our
case is too long a one to tell you,
while our foes are so near. My name
is John Smith; we have come from
Hull, and that is my ship out there,
and we were bound to the South
Sea isles, and on the way out, some
of my crew grew rough and rude,
and said they would not mind me,
and put me in chains; and now they
have thrust me, (with my mate and
this man), out here to die. They
mean to go back to the ship, and
make the rest go with them where
they please."
"Have they fire arms?" I said.
"They had two guns, which they
have left in the boat."
"Well, then," said I, "leave the
rest to me. I see that they are all
to sleep now. It will not be a
hard task to kill them all. Shall I
do it?"
He thought for a while, and then
said if we could get rid of two of
them, who were the worst of the lot,
that the rest would give up to him,
and go back to the ship and do what
was right.
I said: " If I do this and help you
to get your ship back, what will you
do for me?"
He said: "If y^'* save my life
and help me to get i«.y ship, you
shall have my ship, and you may go
where you please, or I will take you
right back to your own land. If we
do not get the ship I will stay here
and work for you, and do just as you
say in all things."
I saw that I could trust him, and
I gave each of them a gun, and we
went up near to the men.
One of our men made a slight
noise, which woke up two of them,
and they spoke to the rest, at which
they made a spring for us. I told
our men to fire. They did so, and
we shot two of them. There were
now three of them left, and one of
these had a slight wound, and they
ran for the boat; but Friday had
gone down to it, and brought up the
oars and sails and the guns, and now,
of course, they could not get off. They
were in a great rage, and for a time
did not know what to do; but at last
they made up their minds to yield to
us, and we bound them hand and
foot, and took them up to my place.
The men who were bound I put in
a safe place, and the rest of us went
to my tent, where we had a good
meal, and then sat down to talk and
rest.
I told the men of my life on the
isle, how long I had been here, and
what I had done; and when John
Smith had heard it all, he was like one
struck dumb, and he sat in deep
thought for quite a long time, and
then he said he could not help think
how strange it was that I had been
cast here on this lone isle, and that
while I had been kept here so long,
and could not tell why, how through
me the lives of all the men here were
safe, and that we ought all to bless
God, who had shown so much love
to us, and that this should teach us
at all times to trust Him.
'35
CHAPTER XIV.
We knew that the rest of the crew
would soon come to find the first
ones, and that we must in some way
get the best of them. I thought
the best thing to do was to bring
the boat up close on shore, take out
what things there were left in her,
and stave her in, and then wait to
see how we could get the ship.
We all went down and broke a
large hole in the boat, and drew it
up quite high on the sand, and what
few things there were in it I gave
to Friday to take to our tent. While
we were at work we heard a gun
fire. It came from the ship, and
was a sign for the men to come
back; but when the men on the
ship found the boat did not move,
they let down a small boat, and ten
men got in it and came to the shore.
When we saw them get in the boat,
we went up and hid back of some
trees till they came on the land.
John S. said that three of these men
were as bad as the two we had shot,
and if we could shoot them we had
naught to fear from the rest, and
there was but one more bad one left
on the ship. He was the head one;
but when he saw that he had no one
to help him, he would have to give
in; and he thought it would not do
to kill these men, for we would need
them on the ship.
When the men came up to where
the boat lay, and saw that there was
no one in it, three of them went up
and down the shore, and sent up
loud yells to make their friends hear;
but as this did not seem to do, they
all but one (whom they left to watch
the boat) came on shore, and went
off to the south side of the isle, and
had a long talk. They came back in
a short time, and we thought they
would all go off to the ship, and we
would lose them and the ship; so
I sent Friday and the mate down
a short way and told them to call,
which they did, and the men ran
up and down, to hear where the
noise came from. I told Friday
and the mate to creep close to the
ground in one way, and John S. and
I went round on the side near the
creek. In this way we could see,
and then, when I gave the word,
we could all fire at once.
In a short time three of the men
came close up to us, and at a sign
from me Friday and the mate shot
at them. One fell dead, the next
was hurt, and the third cried out,
"Who are you?" The mate said:
"I am the mate, and you must yield,
or you are all dead men."
He said: "To whom must we
yield?"
"To John S. He is here with
the King and five score men, and
if you do not yield you are all lost."
The rest of the men had-come
up, and as it was so near dark,
they could not see us; and when
they heard the mate say this they
laid down their arms, and in a
short time they were bound hand
and foot, and Friday and Jack took
them to the cave, where Friday kept
watch all night.
The next morn John S. went to
them, and he told them that he had
come from the King, and it was his
will that they should all stay there
till they could make up their minds
to give up and do what was right,
and go back to the ship, and do just
as he bid them. All but two of
them said they would be glad to do
all this. He told them he would go
and tell the King.
We thought it best to keep them
there for a few days, and gave Friday
charge of them, and he took them
food and drink three times a day.
John S. and the mate went to the
ship in the small boat the men came
in; and when they got to the ship
there were but . three men on the
deck, and one of them was the man
who had been the head of the gang.
John S. and the mate soon put him
out of the way, and the rest of the
men were glad to be free, for they
did not wish to harm John S., but
fear of the bad men had made them
act as they did. They said they
would work for him, and help him
to take the ship home. They then
went down in the ship, and when
they had put things to rights in her,
they brought her up to the isle.
When she came up to the shore I
was up on the top of the hilt, and
John S. came up to me and said:
"My dear friend, there is your ship,
for she is all yours, we are yours,
and all that is in her is yours."
This was too much for me, and
I was like one that was dumb,
and I sank faint to the ground.
John S. took me by the hand to lift
me up, and gave me a drink of wine
that he had in a flask he had brought
from the ship; and though this gave
me some strength, still I could not
speak for a long time. I shed tears
.of joy. There was the ship, her
sails set, and her flags thrown out to
the wind, and I could now go home.
I gave my friend a hug and told him
I would go with him, for I felt that
he had been sent to me from God.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141
ship, and John S. gave me a whole
suit of clothes, which I put on. I
felt strange, and could scarce get
round in them. I thought of poor
Friday the first time he had his
clothes on. John S. thought we
ought to go right off, but I told him
we ought to see to the men that
were bound in the cave. We did
not like to trust them to go back
with us, and as they had not seen
me, I went to them and told them
I had come from the King, and he
had said that I might set them free
if they would swear they would stay
on the isle and work the land, for if
they went back with us they would
all be hung for what they had done
on the ship. I set them all free, and
told them how they might live, and
how I had done, and I gave them,
in charge of Frank and Jack, and I
told Frank I would send him some
men from his own land as soon
as I could.
I took Friday, one of my polls,
my goat skin cap and coat, with all
the gold I had laid by so long, and
went on board the ship; and the
next day, when I had bid all good
bye, we set sail for home.
Home! what a sweet word. I
had been on the isle a score and
eight years, and to whose love and
care did I owe all, my life and health,
these friends, with the way and
means to get home to my own land?
It was on this isle that I had been
brought to know God, and. my heart
rose in praise to Him, and I knelt
down to thank Him for all He had
done for me.
Chapter XV.
We had fair winds and a good
time most of the way to Hull, for it
was from here that John S. had
brought the ship, and he thought he
ought to take it back to the same
place; and I was glad to come
here, for it was near my old home,
and I had now as great a wish to get
back there, as I had to leave it when
I was a boy.
When I went to my old home in
York, what a change I found there!
It is true, there was the stream,
and the house stood there still,
and the farm was the same, but my
dear friends were all gone, and the
stones at the head of their graves
in the yard back of the old church
were all that was left to tell me the
sad news of when and where they
were gone. They had thought me
dead for years, so they left all their
wealth to some friends who were
near of kin.
As I did not care to claim it, and
had no cause to stav here, I thought
I would go down and see the men I
had left my farm with, and see what
they had done.
And now I had a piece of good
luck which I did not look for. John
Smith told the men whose ship he
had, what I had done to save his
life, and how I took care of him on
the isle; and they made up a large
purse of gold and gave it to me; and
this, with the gold I had brought
from the isle, made quite a large
sum.
I set sail for the south as soon as
I found a ship that went that way.
When I got to my farm I found that
Wells, the man who had bought the
farm with .me, was dead, and the rest
of the men whom I left in charge,
had made up their minds that I too
was dead, for they had not heard
from me; and as they did not wish
to stay there, they had sold my farm
and gave one third the price to the
King, and two thirds to some good
men near by, whose work it was to
teach the dark souls that were all
round, to love and pray to God.
I then went to hunt up the man
who took me to sea the fiust time.
I found him grown to be quite old,
and at first he did not know me; I
told him of my first trip to sea, and
this brought me to his mind.
He was quite glad to see me, and
told me how and where he had been
since he left me. He said his son
had charge of a ship, and- was not at
home, but that he would do all he
could to help me. He thought I
ought to stay in my own land, and
take my gold and buy a farm. He
said, he thought I could get a good
price for a piece. of land that I had
near my old farm, and he wrote to
a friend of his to sell it for me, which
he did, and I was paid such a large
sum for it, that with all the rest I
had I was quite rich. So, I thought
I wouM seek a place to live in, but
my old wish to roam came on, so I
thought I would see some more of
the world, and I went to France,
and from there to Spain. Of course,
Friday went all round with me, and
the poor man did not know what to
make of all the new and strange
things he saw. He did not know
why it should be so cold on the top
of the high hills, nor where the snow
came from.
One day we met four men, and
they said they would like to join us
and go round with us, so we took a
guide, and for four weeks they were
with us.
We came to a wild spot one day,
and Friday had a great deal of fun
with some bears that we found there.
He made us all laugh to see him
climb up a tree and shake hands
with an old bear that was on a large
limb. We shot some of the bears
and took their skins with us. Friday
was full of life and fun, and did all
he could to make it bright for us,
and was of great use to us at all
times. The men were quite fond of
him, and when they left us they
made him a nice gift.
When I had gone round for some
months, I went back to the land of
my birth, and there I met a fine
young girl whom I made my wife.
I bought a large farm with a good
house on it, and for some years
dwelt there in rest and peace. I
was rich, and had no need to work
hard. In time I had two sons, and
I found" my spare hours could be
well spent with them. I taught
them to work on the farm, and I felt
the truth of some lines I had once
read:
"Free from vice, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But right in the midst of all this
joy, there came a great blow to me,
and this was the death of my good
wife.
It is not my place here to say too
much in praise of her. She was full
of love for me, and had a kind heart
for all; she had a sound mind, and
was to me like a bright star to lead
me in the right way.
Her loss was so great to me, and
my home was now so sad, that I
could not stay there in peace; each
turn I made brought my wife to my
mind.
In a few months from the time I
lost my wife, the son of a near friend
of mine came to me, and told me he
would like to go to sea if I would go
with him. I had a great wish to go
back to the lone isle where I had
been so long. I told him if he
would take me there I would be
glad to go to sea with him. This he
said he would do, and went off to get
a ship and crew.
While he was gone, I sold my
farm and made my will. I gave to
each of my sons a share of my wealth,
and put them in the care of the wife
of my old friend, who had been so
good to me when I was a young
man.
One bright day in the first of the
year 1693, Friday and I set sail
with my young friend for our old
home on the isle.
When we had been out for some
weeks, one dark night one of the
men came to me, and said he saw a
great light a long way off. I took
up my glass, but could see no signs of
land, and thought it must be a ship
in flames; so I told my friend who
had the ship in charge, that we must
try to get up close to it, and in a half
hour we could see that it was a large
ship on fire. We told the men to
hang out lights all round on our
ship, and to .fire off five guns, for a
sign to them that we saw them and
would come and help them.
By da ylight the next morn, three
large boats came up to us, full of those
that had been on board of the ship.
They said the fire broke out down
in the hold of the ship, from some
sparks of fire from some of the
pipes, which the men had to
smoke.
It was a French ship, and the poor
folks were all in a wild state. They
had thought there was no hope for
them, and when they saw our ship
and felt that they were safe, and would
not have to go down in the sea, they
sent up shouts of joy, and wrung
their hands, and some would sing
and some would dance, while some
could do naught but sit still and
look at us. There was a young
priest on board, and he went round
to soothe them, and when all were
calm, he made them all kneel down
and thank God.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
In a few days we met a ship that
was on her way to France, and we
put most of the poor folks on board,
to go back to their own homes. The
young priest, with a young man and
a young girl, said they would like
to go to the isle with me.
In four months from the time we
left my home, we came in sight of the
isle. I said to Friday, "Do you
know where you are?"
He said with a smile and a clap
of his hands, " Oh, yes, oh there!"
"Well, Friday, do you think we
shall find the folks we left, and do
you think we shall see poor old
Jack?"
He stood mute for some time, and
then said, with tears in his eyes,
"No, no, no see him more."
"Why so?" said I, "how do you
know that?"
"Oh no," says Friday, " he long
dead; he much old man."
"Well, Friday," said I, "we shall
»
see.
When .we came near to the shore,
I told the mate to fire off three guns,
and hang out a white flag of truce,
so as to let those that were on the
land know that we were friends; and
then I let down a small boat, and
took the priest and Friday with some
men, and we went up the creek. which
was near my old place. I told the
men they must not go on shore till I
gave the word; but Friday caught
sight of poor old Jack, and I could
not keep him in the boat. He ran
up to him, and felt of him, and put
both of his arms round him, and gave
him a hug and a kiss, and then took
him by the hand and made him sit
down on the ground, so that he could
talk to him.
For a week he kept this up. He
would fetch Jack some good thing
to eat, and lead him up and down,
like a girl, and would tell him all he
had heard and seen since he had
left him. I thought if all sons would
act in this way, there would be no
need for God's fifth law.
CHAPTER XVI.
While Friday was with Jack, I
went on shore; I saw my friend
Frank on the top of the hill. He
did not know me; I went up to him
and took off my hat, and said, "Sir,
do you not know ' me?" He gave
his gun to a man who stood near,
and came up to me, and threw his
arms round me, and gave me a hug.
He said he was glad to see me; that
he had thought a good deal of me,
but as he had not heard from me
for so long a time, he had made up
his mind that he should see me no
more. He then made a sign to
the man who had his gun, and
bade him go and call the men,
and told me to come up to my old
place.
I sent the men in the boat back
to the ship, and took the priest and
we went to my farm; but I did not
know it, the trees had grown up
so thick round it, that it was like a
dense woods, and they had built
forts all round. I said, "What are
these forts for?"
Frank said, when he had told me
all that he had gone through since I
left him, I would see that he had
great need of them.
The man to whom he spoke when
I first met him, now came back, with
ten men, and Frank said, "There
are some of the men who owe their
lives to you." In the dress they
wore, it was hard work for me to
guess who they were, but Frank soon
made it clear to both them and me,
and they came up to greet me, one
by one, not like plain men, but like
men of rank would come to a King.
We now went to my tent. Frank
had built it out, and it was large and
full of things Frank had made, such
as chairs, stands, shelves, and two
good beds. When we sat down
Frank said he would tell me what
hard work he had with some of the
men.
But first, I must tell you that
when I left the isle, in the ship with
John S., three of the men got off,
and went back to the isle to seek
those that were left there. You know
that two of those on the isle were the
worst ones in the crew; and now
these two went with those who came
back, and it was with these five bad
men Frank had such a hard time.
The rest were all right; they went to
work to build huts and raise grain,
and would mind Frank in all things.
The rogues thought that these
good men should keep them and
work for them, for they did not like
to work. and they did not want to
live right, so the good men would
not help them. This put the rogues
in a rage, and they swore they would
fix them; but the good men took this
as a jest. One of the rogues said,
"they will see if it is a jest;" and one
day when some of the good men
were off, one of the rogues took up
a large stick that was on fire, and
put it to the side of one of the huts,
and would have set it on fire, but
one of the men thrust it one side, or
else this hut with all the rest would
have been burnt up. This led to
a great fight, and the good men
drove the rogues off to the north end
of the isle, near where the wild men
came for their feasts, and here they
dug a sort of cave in a piece of
woods to sleep in at night, but would
be up to all sorts of bad deeds in the
day time.
They would steal the corn, and
pull up the stalks, run off with the
goats, and do all that they could to
vex and tease the good men. One
day three of the good men went
down on the shore, and the rogues
came at them and there was a great
fight, which, when the rest of the
XI
good men heard, they came down to
help their friends, and they took the
rogues to Frank; he took their arms
from them, and said, "Why do you
act in this way?" They said they
could not live where they were.
Frank told them if they would do
no more harm, but be still and try to
work, the good men would try to help
them and they could live in peace,
but they could not have their arms.
For a while all went on in peace;
the rogues would do some work, but
this did not last long; they grew
bold, and were soon at their old
tricks once more. Frank thought he
would have to put them in a boat
and send them off; but a strange
thing took place one night, which
made them tame for a long time.
Frank had gone to bed in the tent,
but he could not sleep; his mind was
ill at ease; he said he felt as if there
was a great weight on his mind, and
thought he should hear some bad
news. He thought that there might
be a plot with the rogues to kill the
good men; so he woke up the man
who was with him, and told him. how
he felt, and he said, "Say you so? I
think we should go out, and look
round." This man went up to the
top of the hill, and came back with
the word, that there was a great light
not far off, and he heard men shout
and yell as if there was a great fight.
Frank then went and told the
men, and they all went up the hill
to watch. There were three sets
of wild men, and they were all in
a fierce fight. The men thought
they would like to go down, but
Frank said they must stay there,
and he sent Jack down, to spy out
why they came. He took off his
clothes so as to be like one of them,
and then went right down. He had
been gone an hour, when he came
back and said that there were two
tribes, and that they were in a fierce
fight, and would stay there till the
light of day.
Jack could scarce keep the men
back. He told them there were
scores of the wild men, and that they
could do no good, but to let them
fight it out; it would be the best way
to get rid of them.
They fought for three hours, and-
by this time it was quite light, and
then they got in the boats and went
off. The men went down to view
the place, and they found more than
a score of dead men, and three who
were hurt, and these they took care
of and kept them to work for them.
When the rogues saw what work
the wild men had made, and the burnt
bones that lay strewn all round, it
made them sick, and for some time
they were quite mild, and would do
just as Frank bid them, as well as
their share of the work.
One day one of the rogues got mad
at one of the slaves, and took up his
axe to kill him, when one of the good
men went up to him, and told him
to stop, which made the rogue mad,
and he would have made short work
of him, but some of the rest of the
good men came up to help him, and
then the rogues came to join their
friend, and there was quite a fight,
which Frank had to stop.
Frank now saw that it was of no
use to try and keep the bad men
with the good ones, and that it would
be best for them to go some where
else, and so he gave some corn, rice,
grain, and clothes, with some tools
to work with (for he said it would
not be right to let them starve), and
sent them off to one end of the
isle. He told them if they came
near his men, to hurt them, to
steal their flocks, or to spoil or
burn their goods, he would put
them to death.
They went to the N. E. end of
the isle, and put up two tents, and
set out some young trees, like those
that were round my large tent, and
for six months all went well with
them; but this could not last; they
would not work, and one day they
took a whim to go to the place where
the wild men came from, and see if
they could not seize some, and bring
them back to the isle and make
slaves of them. They came to
Frank and his men, and told them
they would like a boat and some
food and clothes to take with them.
Frank's men were so glad to get
rid of them, that they gave them all
these things, and some firearms too,
for they told them the wild men
would try to kill them, and they
must have some arms to keep them
off. They bid them God speed,
and thought they should see no
more of them.
Chapter XVII.
But, in three weeks, they came
back. They said they went first to
the main land, but the men that
were there would not let them come
on shore; so they went on, till they
came to an isle which lay to the
west of the main land. Here they
met with a kind race of men, who
said, "they did not eat men, nor
fight if they could help it." They
went on shore, and gave the chief
man some of the things they had,
and he made his men bring them
food, fish and fruit, and when they
came off, they brought down five
girls and six men to take back as
slaves.
They did not know what to do
with them all, but saw that they
must take them, or the chief might
get mad, and then he would hurt
them; so they gave the chief an
axe, an old key and a knife, and
he put them in their boat.
When Frank and his men heard
this, they went down to see the
slaves, and found them all bound
in one of the huts. The poor things
were full of fear when they saw the
men, for they thought they had
come down to look at them, that
they might pick out the best ones to
kill; so Frank sent old Jack to tell
them that they would not hurt them.
As Frank and his friends did not
want the girls with them, the rogues
said they would like to wed them;
so they drew lots for them and each
took a wife. This was a good thing
for them all. The girls were true,
smart and clean, and as the men now
had some one to care for, they built
huts and laid out farms, and in this
way soon made their part of the isle
look like a small town.
The black men said they would
work for the men, but as there was not
much for them to do, and they did
not watch them, one day one of them
ran off to the woods. They thought
he was dead, but in a few weeks, when
they saw six boats full of black men
come on shore, and go right to the
place where the men were, they
knew that he had gone home, and
told his friends how and where to
find them.
The wild men went right to the
woods, and when the white ones went
to catch them, they found they hadset
on fire some of their huts, and they
were all in flames. This made them
rage, and they laid a plan to shoot
them as they came out of the woods.
So two of the white men got up in
the trunk of a large tree that stood
on the edge of the wood, and when
they saw them, they took aim at
them through a hole in the tree,
and as they came out, in this way
they shot near half a score of them.
The rest now all ran out of the woods,
and Frank and his men, who had
come up to help the white men, shot
full two score more. They then
bound most of the rest, and put
them in their boats, and sent them
back to their own land.
There were a few who had a wish
to stay with the white men and be
their slaves, so they kept them. The
men now went to look for their wives.
They found them safe, but near all
their huts were burnt down. They
soon built these up, with the help of
Frank's men.
For six months they saw no more
of the wild men.
But one day, just at dusk, some of
the men saw a score of small boats
come up on the east side of the isle,
full of men, who had darts, bows,
clubs and swords. They were a
fierce set, and our men were full of
fears, but they knew they could not
do much that night. They thought
they would make things as safe as
they could. So they drove their
goats and flocks to the old cave, took
up most all their huts or tents, and
sent their wives to my big tent, all
but two, who would not go; they
said they could fight with bows,
which they did, and were a great
help to the men. » \
Frank now took the men, and gave
part of them to one of the rogues
whose name was Will, and he took
the rest in his charge. Will, though
he had been a bad man, was bold,
and just the one to head the men.
They took all the arms they had, and
went up as near the wild men as they
could, and hid till the next morn.
When the sun was up quite high
the wild men came in crowds to
where our men were, when at a sign
from Frank, they shot at them right
and left. The foe were so close, that
they fell dead all round, and those
that the men did not kill were hurt,
and this put them in a great fright;
they flew to the woods as swift as
they could, and here they set up
loud cries and shouts. Frank told
his men to let them be, for they would
soon be so sore and stiff from their
wounds, that it would not be a hard
task to get the best of them; so the
men went down to the shore where
the boats lay, and" they took some
dry wood from a dead tree and set
most of their boats on fire.
When the wild men saw this they
were so mad that they ran up and
down the isle, and trod down the corn
and tore up their vines and plants.
A great storm came up that night,
and as the boats were most all gone
the wild men could not get off. Our
men had to watch them all that night;
and at the break of the next day,
they found that a score of them were
dead in the woods, and the rest were
sick and hurt; so they sent old Jack
to those that were left, and he told
them that if they would give up to
the white men they would save their
lives, and be kind to them, and
that they should live on a part of
the isle, but that they must not come
near the white men, but keep in
their own bounds. This they were
glad to do, and Frank gave them a
place way off on the south east end of
the isle, and he gave them corn to
plant, and they soon learnt to make
all kinds of things with wood and
corn, such as chairs, and stands, and
beds.
They were now down on the end
of the isle where Frank had put them,
and the white men did not see them
for weeks at a time. And from that
time, till I came to the isle, they had
not seen or heard of a wild man.
You must not think that Frank
told me all this at once, as I have
told it to you. When we went out
to walk, he would show me the
tents, and all that had been done and
built on the isle, and in this way I
found out what I have told you. I
now saw why Frank had built the
forts I spoke of, to keep him and his
friends safe from the bad white men,
and the wild men.
Chapter XVIII.
I had some long talks with Will
and the rest of the rogues. They said
they knew they had done wrong, but
that now they had wives and good
homes, if I would help them they
would try and do right. I told them
I would do all I could for them.
One day I told all the men on
the isle that they must come and
dine with me. I got the ship's cook
and his mate to come on shore to
dress my meal. We brought on
shore six rounds of beef with four
of pork, a punch bowl full of beer,
and ten flasks of French wine.
Frank gave us five whole kids to
roast; we sent some of the fresh
meat in a close dish, to the men on
the ship, as they had not had fresh
meat for a long while. We had a
gay time at this feast, and when we
were through, I took Will and his
men down on board of the ship, and
gave them some thin, loose, light
coats, some shirts, and socks, and
shoes, and some tools to work with,
such as hoes, rakes, spades and
knives, as well as some arms. For
these the}'gave me great thanks, and
said that as I had done so much for
them, they should bear in mind all I
had said to them, and that they
would stay on the isle as long as I
bid them, and try at all times to do
their best, and would live in peace
with all the men on the isle.
The young priest, who had gone
all round the isle with me and knew
all Frank had told me, said to me
one day, that he would like to stay
on the isle, and he thought the
young men and the young girl who
were on the ship would like to do
the same, as they could do a great
deal of good to these poor men and
their wives. He thought that he
ought to preach the word of God to
them, for the most of them would,
no doubt, have to end their days
here.
I was glad to hear him say this,
and told him I thought it was a good
plan. I went to the ship and
brought the young folks on shore,
and with them a young man, that
we gave the name of Jack-of-all-
trades to, as he could do all sorts of
things, and was of so much use to
us on the ship. I found in my room
five or six books of God's Word, and
all but one of these I gave to the
priest, and that one I gave to Will,
and told him I would like him to
read it night and morn, which he
said he would do.
One day the young man came to
me and said with a shy look, that as
we had a priest, there were two
young folks that would like to wed.
I thought it was the maid and this
young man; so I told him to think
well of it, for the maid had not been
brought up as he had, and was not
of the same rank with him, and that
at some time he might feel bad, and
wish to get rid of her; but he said
,with a smile, he was not the man, it
was the maid and Jack-of-all-trades.
I told him I was glad of this, for I
thought Jack was a smart, true man,
and the maid a good girl, and she
could do a great deal to help and
teach the rest of the poor girls on
the isle.
The priest said he had one thing
to ask of me, and that was, that he
might keep Friday with him, as he
could do so much to help him learn
the speech of the black men that
were there, and could teach them to
know and pray to God as he did.
I told the priest that I felt what
he said was true, but that Friday had
been so long with me, and was so
true to me, that I could not part with
him; and I told him once he should
not leave me, and that if I did not
take him with me now, he would
think I was false to him, and he
would die of grief.
I had now been here for a month,
and as all the men were at peace, I
thought I would go back to the ship
and sail round and see some more of
the world.
My mind was in such a state, in
fact had been so all my life, that I
could not rest long in a place. So
true it is that what is "born in the
bones can not be beat out of the
flesh." I sent for the men to come
and talk with me once more, and
gave them each a piece of land, and
quite a large farm to Jack-of-all-
trades, and I told them they must
try and live in peace and learn to
love the Lord, and do all they could
that was right, and when I got home
I would send them some stock, such
as cows, pigs, and sheep, as well as
some goods for clothes. I then bid
them all good bye, and set sail.
It was the sixth of May, a clear
bright day, we shot off five guns and
the men on the shore did the same,
and we were soon out of sight.
When we had been out to sea
three days, the mate came to me and
said, "Sir, do you see that fleet?" I
took out my glass, and saw that
there were scores of small boats full
of wild men. The men in the ship
were full of fear, and I must say that
I felt there were so few of us,
that they might do us a great deal
of harm, but I told the men to take
their arms and to fix them, then to
get out the small boats and man
them, and to furl all the sails, and we
would lay by and wait for them to
come, and we could fire on them. I
thought they might try to fire our
ship, so I told the men not to let
them come too near.
They came quite fast, and in a
short time were quite close to us. I
told Friday to go on deck and call to
them, and ask them what they meant.
He did so, but as soon as they
heard him speak, they took aim at
him. Friday said with a loud voice
"They will shoot," and just then they
sent out full three score darts; three
of them struck poor Friday, and he
fell dead.
When I saw poor Friday fall, I
was so mad and full of rage, that I
told my men to load four guns with
large shot and five with small, and
to give them such a blast of fire as
they had not seen or heard in their
lives. I can not tell how they were
hurt; we knew that we had shot
some of them, for we saw them sink,
and most of their boats were split or
sunk; but they did not seem to mind
this, for they were in such a great
fright and haste to get off, that those
who could swim did so, and the rest
took the good boats and went off as
fast as they could, and in less than
three hours we could not see a sign
of them.
There was one poor man who
could not swim, so our men took him
on the ship. He was hurt and could
not speak for some time, and for a
long while he did not want to eat;
but we taught him a few words of
our own tongue, and then he told us,
that the day we saw the wild men,
there were five tribes, and they were
out with their kings to have a great
fight, and that when his king saw
our ship, he said they must come up
to it and fight there, so as to let us
see them, for they thought it would
be a grand sight, but the noise and
fire from our guns were so great,
that it gave them such a fright, they
were glad to get out of our way as
quick as they could.
Poor Friday! I must now take my
last leave of him. My heart was
sad and full of grief when I thought
of his love, how true and kind he
had been, and now he was gone, and
how I should miss him.
Chapter XIX.
I had a box made, and we put
him in it, and let him down in the
sea, and the men shot off ten guns
as he went down.
We now went on our way. We
had fair winds and a smooth sea,
and in two weeks we came to All
Saints Bay. Here I had a sloop
made, on which I put a crew of eight
men with their wives. I bought a
large stock of goods and tools, and
these, with three cows, five calves, a
score of hogs, two sheep, a horse and
two mares, I put on board the sloop,
and sent them all to my friends on
the isle, as I had told them I would
do when I left them. I told the
mate how to go there, and I heard
that the sloop and all on board went
there safe and sound, and the things
were such a great help to them, that
in a few years I would not have
known the old isle.
And now I shall take leave of my
isle. I had done all I could for those
that were there, and if they did not
want to stay they could go where
they had a wish to, for they had the
sloop and some small boats, as well
as the large boat Friday and I had
made; but as I have said, I heard
that all went well with them, and I
thank God, that I have had the
chance to do some good in my life.
We went from All Saints Bay to
the Cape of Good Hope. We did
not stay here long. There did not
seem to be much to be done or seen
here; so we laid in a stock of
some things we were in need of, and
went to a large isle, which lies north
east of the Cape. We put our ship
in port on the east side of the isle,
and I, with some of the men, got
in a small boat and went on shore.
We saw that the folks who dwelt here
were kind, and we thought we could
do well here.
The men came down to look at
us, and when we saw them, we cut
three boughs from a tree, and stuck
each of them at just such a space,
and they did the same, for this was
a mark with them of a sort of truce,
and that we could trade with them,
but we must not pass their poles or
sticks, nor take our arms with us,
and they must do the same, and we
must all buy and sell by these sticks.
They brought us milk, roots, fish
and meat, and were glad to take
knives and such small things as we
had to give them.
The first night we were here, some
of the men thought they would stay
on shore all night; so they made a
small hut to sleep in, and I went
with a man and a boy in the boat.
At two o'clock the next morn I
heard one of the men on shore call
for help, and then I heard a gun. I
woke up the man who was with me
(and told the boy to watch the boat),
and we took all the arms we had
with us and went on shore to help
them.
There were but nine of us and
there were scores of the foe; they
sent their darts at us, and we shot
off our guns; we knew that we had
hurt some of them from the cries we
heard, but it was too dark for us to
see well. Our men came in the
boat, and we put up boards and
chests and stood back of them, and
then we made signs to the ship to
come to us, and the man in charge
brought her up, and we all kept
watch till it was light, when the men
from the ship came on shore and we
sent them such fierce fire, from our
large and small guns, that they fled
to the woods in a short time.
We found the cause of the fight to
be the fault of one of our men; he
had said some rude things to one of
the girls who came to bring them
milk, which she did not like, and she
told some of her friends, and they
all came down to beat him for it.
This man's name was Tom; he was
not to be found with our men, and
though we kept on the look out for
him for two days, he did not come,
and we made up our mind that he
was dead.
Some of the men said they would
go and look for him, but this I did
not want them to do. I told them
they might share the fate that Tom
had, but they would not heed, and
eight of them went off, while the rest
went on the ship, and I took two
men and a boy and went to the boat.
When our men went off they did
not mean to harm their foes, but see
if they could find Tom, and at the
same time look for gold. They
went on for a mile and saw no one,
and thought they must have gone
the wrong way, when they saw a
cow by a tree, and then they knew
that some one must live near, and in
a short time, they came to a small
town, and the first sight here that
met their eyes was poor Tom. They
had hung him to a tree by one arm,
and then cut his throat.
This made them so mad, that they
swore they would kill all their foes
and fire the town. The huts were all
13
small but one, and most of the foe
were in the large one. Our men
went to work as still as they could,
and in a short time the large house
and some of the small huts were in
a blaze. This made the foe run out
on all sides with sharp yells of fright,
and our men shot them as if they
were mad dogs.
We heard the noise and saw the
light, and I said to the men who
were with me in the boat, we must
get help from the ship, and go and
see what this means. The men from
the ship came with us, and the light
from the fire was so great that we
found our way to the town; and what
a sight there was here! the dead foes
lay all round, the huts were in flames,
and our men were more like wild
beasts than men. I was like one that
had been struck dumb with fright.
When they saw us, they came up to
us and one of them said, "I am so
glad you have come, but we are not
half done yet."
At this, I said, with a loud voice,
"Wretch! what are you at? What
does this mean? If you do not stop,
I will shoot you down like a dog."
"Why, sir," said he, "if you want
to know why we have done this,
come here;" and he led me to where
poor Tom hung.
I told him that Tom had done
wrong, and the black men were not
to blame; that he would do the same
if he had the same cause; but this
did no good, and when the rest of
the men came up, and saw Tom,
they were just as bad. They said this
man was right, and they would kill
all the men they could find.
As I could not stop them, I went
off; and the thought of that day's
work made me sad for a long time,
for I felt that God's wrath must be
on our men.
The next day we set sail, and for
a few weeks all went well. One day
we had to stop at a small town on
the coast to get some food, and I
thought I would go on shore and
look round to see what kind of a
place it was.
While I was gone the men on the
ship had a talk, and they told the
man in charge that I must not come
back on the ship, for they were mad
at what I said to them on the
isle. They said I had no right to
scold them, and they did not like
me, and that he must leave me on
shore. He told them that he could
not do this; that I had a large share
in the ship, and he must take me
with him. But they would not hear
a word of this; they said they would
"one and all" leave the ship, and he
could run the boat. So he had to
come on shore to me, and when he
told me all they had said, I thought,
for his sake, I would stay, for if these
men left him, I did not see where he
was to get a crew from; so I told
him to send me all the things that
were in my room on the ship, and
to send me some gold as soon as he
could.
The next morn he sent me my
goods, and with them his own man
to wait on me. And now, once
more, I was left in a strange land.
But I found the men here were kind,
and full of good will, and that ships
came by two or three times a week;
there were some folks here from my
own land, and with one of these I
got good board for me and my man.
CHAPTER
XX.
I was in this place nine months,
and made some warm friends. I
bought some fine gems, and some
drugs, as well as some goods which
I thought would be good to trade.
There was a man in the same
house with me, and he thought that if
we were to hire a ship, and take our
goods to a land that was not far off,
we could do well; for, said he, "Why
should we stand still here? there are
no drones in the world but men, and
why should we be of that class?"
It took us some time to get a ship
to our minds, and we had hard work
to pick up a crew, but we found some
Dutch men who said they would go;
we put all our goods on board, and
set sail.
On our way out, we found the
ship was an old and poor one, and
that we should have to stop and fix
it; so we put in port at a large place,
and I told the mate, as we would
have to wait for a few days, I would
go on shore and see if I could find
some goods we could take with us.
I found here some ships and men
from my own land, and some from
the East. I saw, too, there were some
fine goods and fruits which I knew
would be of great use to us, and I
thought I would lay in a large stock,
so went each day to buy some.
One day the man of whom I had
bought most of my goods, said to
me, "I think it would be best for
you to leave here as soon as you can,
for there are some men here who say
they will burn your ship and hang
you." "Hang me! what for?"
"Well, they have heard some strange
things, and I thought I would tell
you, and warn you in time."
For a long while I could not speak;
for I did not know how they could
hear of me, as this was the first time
in my life I had been there, but I
gave him my thanks and went right
on board the ship, and told the mate
what I had heard; and he said he
thought the ship was all right now,
and we could set sail that day.
There was quite a strong breeze,
and it was not long when we were
some way out to sea, and by night
we thought we were out of their
reach, but the next morn I was
down in one of the rooms of the ship,
when one of the men put his head
in the door and said, there were five
boats full of men in full chase for us.
I went up and saw the mate, and
we brought all the men up on deck,
and told them we thought these men
meant to seize our ship and take and
hang us all. I said to them, "Will
you stand by us?" and they all said
they would live or die with us. Our
mate said he thought the best way
was to keep them off with our great
shot as long as we could, and then
to fire on them with our small arms,
and we must try to keep them down
off the deck of the ship.
When they were most up to us,
we hung out a white flag, but, as they
would not heed this, we took it in and
hung out a red one, to show them
we would fight for our lives, and then
we sent them such a good round
of great shot that they kept off for
some time, and when they came up
once more, we sent such a blast of
fire from five of our great guns, that
it took off the stern of one of their
boats, so that it soon sank; and the
men who had charge of our guns
kept up the fire for a long while,
which hurt them and their boats so
much they were glad to give up and
let us go.
There were two men who were
hurt so that they could not swim,
and they were in the sea so close to
our ship that we took them in. One
of these men was a Dutch man, and
he told us the cause of all this was
that the man of whom we had bought
o
the ship was in port with us, and he
had told the men there we were a
bad set of men; that we went up and
down on the sea to rob ships, and that
we had stole the ship we had. This
made them so mad they made up
their minds to come and take us
and the ship to the land, and hang
us all, and not wait to hear the
truth.
We could not make out what this
meant, but when we came to ask
more of this man, we found the man
we had bought our ship from was a
thief, and that he was on board of the
ship with this Dutch man, and that
he would not mind the men in
charge of the ship, and one day he
got mad and shot the head man, and
got some more of the men to join
him, and they ran off with the ship,
and took it to the place where we
first saw him, and sold it to us, and
in some way he came to this last
place, and when he saw us he thought
he might be found out, so had told
this, a lie, to the men, and then said
to this Dutch man if he told the
truth he would kill him; but we had
been so brave that they could not
stand our fire arms, and so had left
us.
All went on well for some days,
when we found that our ship had
sprung a leak, way down on one
side. We did not know what to do.
We must fix it, or it would go down;
and we did not want to go on
shore, for we did not know what
foe we might meet.
I told the men to let down our
small boat, and all that could must
get in, while the rest took in the
sails of the ship; and they took all
the things of great weight and put
them in on one side, and then lay
her up as high as they could on
the beach; and when they had made
a sort of stage to stand on, they
went to work to stop up the leak
and to tar the side of the ship.
There were five of us in the small
boat, and the rest of the men were
at work on the side of the ship,
and we were but a short way from
the land.
The men who dwelt there did not
know what to make of our ship, and
as they saw just a few men they
thought it would be a good chance
to come down and take our goods;
and what few men they saw, they
could make slaves of, or sell to their
king; so they got out some small
boats, and put eight or ten men in
each, and they came up to where we
were.
When I saw what they meant to
do, I told the men to let the stage
slip down in the sea, and we all went
up on deck as soon as we could;
and when they came quite close to
us, two or three of them thought
they would try and climb up the side
of the ship. One of our men stood
near the hot pitch pot, and he took
up a great spoon full, and threw it
on them, which soon sent them down
with a cry of pain. "Well done,
Jack," said one of the men, "give
them some more," which he did, for
he took up the spoon and sent out
the hot stuff to the right and left, on
all sides.
This they could not stand long, for
they went off with cries and howls
of pain, which we heard for some
time.
We then went on with our work,
and, in a day or so, the ship was all
right, and we went on our way. We
did not stop, but went straight north,
and in less than a month we came to
the land (as those who live there call
it) of the Sun.
We went from port to port; in one
place we would sell our goods, and
in the next we would buy more. I
thought I would like to see more of
this land, than I could do in a ship;
so when we came to the port of one
of their large towns, we sold our ship
and took our goods, and went on
shore. Here we met some men who
were on their way to the chief town
in the land, where there was to be
a great fair, and they said they would
like us to join them.
One of the men was a Scot; he
had been here for a long time, and
knew all their ways, and he said he
could show us the land and how to
trade with the men. We said we
would join them, and made the Scot
our head or chief; we gave him part
of our gold and told him to pay our
bills, and to lead us at all times. We
thought it best to take a guide too,
and we soon found that we had need
of both head and guide.
I must tell you of the queer men
who dwelt in this land. They were
light and wore long loose coats like
a blouse, and shoes that were made
of wood; their hair, which was black,
hung in long braids down their
backs; they were smart, and made
lots of fine goods, like fans, shawls,
silks, and dress goods. They did
not know the true God, but had
gods of their own, which they made
of wood and stone, and they would
take these gods with them from place
to place.
One day we saw one on the
ground; it was quite large and had
horns; the sight of it made me sad,
and I felt that I must tell them of
our Lord. Our chief said they
would not heed me; that they did
not like strange men to go through
their land, much less to talk of their
gods, and they might get mad at me,
and kill us all. But I still clung to
the thought, and the more I saw of
these things the more pain I felt, and
I thought, "how I would like to
burn up all these gods." In one
place we met a priest who had been
there for some time, and I had a
long talk with him. He said my zeal
was all right, but it would do no
good for me to treat their gods in
this way or to say much to them; most
of the men could not read or write,
and that they would not know what
we meant; they would not like it,
and, as my chief had said, would
drive us all out. We must leave
them to those who could be sent
from our own land to teach them; it
would be slow work, for they must
be made to feel and know that they
were friends, and did not mean to
harm them; we must pray for them
and leave the rest to God. I saw
he was right, and we went on; but
I made up my mind that I would
do all I could when I got home to
send them help.
One day we came to a large town,
and we thought we would stay here
for a day or two; we found the chief
work of the men here was to make
a fine kind of ware, out of a sort of
clay, which they have a great deal
of; in fact, we did not see much else
but pots, pans, cups, jars, and such
like things. Our guide said he would
like to show us a house all built of
this kind of ware.
I told him I would like to have it
to take home with me, for I thought
he meant a toy house. "Take it
home!" he said with scorn, "why,
there are near two score men in it."
When I came to it I found that
it was a large house built of laths,
and this ware put on them like tiles.
The walls and floors were made of
these tiles; some were blue and white,
some were green, and some of a dark
gray hue. There were ponds with
gold fish in, and the walks in the
yards were all made in this same
odd way.
Our guide did naught but brag of
all the great things they could do;
and when we came to the Great
Wall, which is built for miles and
miles round, he said to me, "What
do you think of that?" I told him
it might do to keep out the men they
stood in fear of, but if some of the
men in my land were to come with
their strong fire arms, they would
knock it down in a short time. When
he heard this he was mute for a long
while, and he did not say much
more of the might of his men.
We now went to the chief town
in the land, and it was full of men
from all parts of the land, who had
come with their goods to the great
fair there. We bought a lot of fans,
shawls, silks, and small toys and
tea. Most of these I sent home to
my friend, who sent me back a large
sum of gold for them.
One day our chief told us there
was to be a great hunt that day, and
he thought we would like to go. I
said to him, "What kind of a hunt?"
He said, "A sheep hunt." This
made us all laugh. The sheep are
shy, but wild, and though swift, they
will not run far, and as they keep
close you are sure to get some.
While we were out we saw two
score of those wild hordes who roam
from place to place, to rob or kill all
whom they may meet; and though
they have no skill to fight, they do
a great deal of harm.
When they saw us they blew a
kind of horn quite loud. This we
knew was to call some of their
friends, and in a short time a score
more came up.
One of our men said this was not
the first time he had seen them, and
he knew just how to deal with them.
He told us we had no time to lose,
and that we must form a line, and
all fire at once when he gave the
word. We did as he told us, and
they let fly their darts, but none of
us were hurt; there were five of them
shot, and the rest fled, and we saw
no more of them.
We went on for a month more,
through the rest of this strange land,
and saw much that was new as
well as queer to us.
As we had seen all we had a
wish to in this land, we thought we
would go to the North Sea, and in
five months we were in a large town
near the coast, but the snow was so
great and it was so cold that I did
not care to stay here long; so I went
a few miles south.
I found this land to be the place
where they send the men who do
not like or mind the Czar (as they
,call their king), and here I met some
men of high rank, and a prince, who
had been sent here, as they could
not make up their minds to think
and do all that the Czar would ask
them to. The prince was a fine
man, full of good deeds and
thoughts.
I told these men my life on the isle,
and of the men I had left there.
They said they thought it a great
and strange case, but that I had
great cause for joy; I was lord of all
while I was there, and could do as I
had a wish, and that my men must
love me, as I had shown them so
much thought and care, which was
more than the Czar had done for
them. I could not keep the prince
and his sad lot out of my mind, and
I thought I would like to have him
go to my own land with me. I said
to him one day, "I have been here a
long time, and think I ought to go
home ; how would you like to go
with me, if you could get off?" At
first, he did not want me to talk to
him of it, but when he had thought
of it for a while, he said that he did
not think he ought to go in that
way, but if I would like to serve or
aid him, I could take with me one
that was near and dear to him, and
that was his son. He did not like to
see him kept here; as he had done
no wrong; he had been sent with
him when a child, and had grown
up here.
The next day he sent for his son,
who had been for some months with
some friends not a great way off.
When I saw the young man my
'neart went right out to him, he was
so like the prince, full of .We ami
kind thoughts for all.
He did not want to leave the
prince, but we made him see it war
for his own good, and that he might
do more for the prince if he went
with me, than he could do there.
The prince gave me a fine let
of skins and furs, and I gave him
some of the goods I had brought
with me, and in a month we left the
place.
We went through two or three
new lands, and in one of them the
young lord found some friends who
said they could help the prince, if
the young man would go to their
court with them. Though I was
loth to part with him, I felt it would
not be right for me to keep him; so
I bade him ."good bye," and then
went straight to my place of birth.
I got back to my old home the
first of the year 1705. And now I
made up my mind to stay here.
I had seen near all this world.
God had been good to me through
all. I had no one to blame for the
ills of my life; I had brought them
on by my self will. My days must
now be few, for I had seen more
than three score and ten years, and
it was time for me to think of that
world of peace and love where I
soon must go.
My book of God's Word, that I
found on the ship, I had kept close
by me through all these years; and
now with that for my guide, I will
wait God's good time to cross that
sea, to the shore where all are at
rest. And while I had to wait, I
thought I would write this book, to
show you, first, that if you would
have joy and peace in this world,
you must mind God's fifth law, and
next, that in all the ills and cares of
life, you must seek God, learn to
love and trust Him, and He will
bring you safe home at last.
The End.

AND
SURPRISING ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
OF YORK, MARINER.
FROM THE ORIGINAL,
IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE.
BY
MARY A. SCHWACOFER,
ILL USTRA TED.
CASSELL & COMPANY, Limited,
NEW YORK, LONDON, AND PARIS.
1882.
By O. M. Dunham.
Chapter I.
I was born in the town of York,
in the spring of 1632. I was the
third son of a man of some wealth,
and I had a good home. I was not
bred to a trade, for my friends had
a wish that I should learn the law as
a means to help me through life.
But, as I grew up, I made up my
mind to go to sea; from a child, my
head had been full of the sea, for
when I was but a small boy I would
sit, for hours at a time, on the banks
of a small stream that was near our
house, and dream of ships and the
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
sea. My friends did all they could
to keep me at home, but it was of
no use, for in the fall of 1651 I ran
off, and soon found my way down
on board of a ship bound for a large
town on the south-east coast of the
land. When safe on board the ship
I felt quite proud and glad, but if I
had known all I had to pass through
in the rest of my life I would have
gone back home, but as I did not, I
went on my way, and though I had
a great deal of bad luck, God took
care of me through it all, and taught
me in time what was for my good.
We had scarce left the land, when
the wind blew up strong and kept
up for a few days, and then a great
storm came on, and one night I
heard one of the men cry out, "The
ship has sprung aleak." All hands
were brought on deck, and set to
work at the pumps. We could hear
the ship creak, and her beams crack
from end to end, and soon it gave
way, and we found that we must do
all we could to save our lives.
We saw a ship a short way off,
and gave them a sign, to make them
know that we were in need of aid.
They came near to us, and sent out
two small boats which we got into,
and we were all soon on board the
ship, and in a short time we were
safe back in the town we came from,
where we met friends who gave us
food and clothes, as well as means to
help us reach our homes.
You will say that now I ought to
have gone home, but I had both
clothes and means, and I was too
proud to go back. The man who
had lost his ship said to me, "Young
man, you ought not to go to sea; this,
your first trip, should be to you a
sign that God will not help you if
you do."
Though I knew he was right, I
was hurt at this, and spoke back in a
rude way, and would not heed him,
but thought I would try it once more.
This time our ship was bound for
some isles in the south. We had
been out six weeks, and were far on
our way, when we saw a queer ship
full of men on our track, and we
could see they were not friends. We
thought we could keep clear of them,
or, if there was need for it, fight them
off, so we put on all our sails, but in
a few hours they caught up to us.
We found they were Turks. They
came on board of our ship, and
though we fought them as well as
we could, they had more men and
guns than we, and when they had
cut all our sails, done all the harm to
the ship they could, put to death
three of our men, and hurt near all
the rest, we had to yield.
They took us to their land, and sent
most of the men to their King, but
the chief of the Turks took me as his
own prize and made a slave of me.
This was a great change for me,
and my heart sank with grief. I had
time now to think of my home, and
all that the dear ones had told me,
but it was too late now, I must do
the best I could. At first I had to
work hard, but as I was young and
quick, the chief soon took me to his
own house to wait on him. From
this time my whole mind was bent
on how I could get off and be free.
I thought, "if the chief will take me
with him when he goes to sea, I will
find a way," but this he would not
do, for when he went to sea he left
me home to work on his farm, and
take care of the house, and when
he was at home I had to fish, and
watch his ship.
When I had been with him two
years he was not so strict, but would
take me with him when he went out
to fish.
One day he sent me with a small
boat to catch some fish, and I brought
home a fine lot, which made him so
glad that he said some guests were
to dine with him the next day, and I
must go out for the fish. He sent
me out in a small ship, with a man,
a Moor, and a boy whose name was
Xury. Now, I thought, this is my
chance to get off; I will be free this
time. I told the boy to get two guns
and some shot, and sent the Moor
for some tools, while I put some food
and wine in the ship, and when we
had all our things on board we set
sail. When we had gone out for a
mile, we sat down to fish, but as the
Moor was a man I felt I could not
trust, I would not pull up my lines,
for I did not want him to see the fish,
and I said to him, "There are no fish
here, we must go out to sea," and
when we had gone for a league, I
put my arm round his waist and
threw him far out in the sea.
He swam up to the ship, and said
if I would take him in, he would go
with me, and stay all his life with me.
I told him I did not want him, and
bade him swim back to the shore.
Xury swore he would be true to me,
and as I thought I would be safe
with him, and he might be of great
use to me, I let him go with me.
We had a fair wind, and in a few
days we were a great way out of the
Turks' reach. As I still had some
fear, I kept out of the way of land
for some time, but we found we must
go on shore to get food and drink.
We came to a place where it was
still, and we saw no one, and I told
Xury we would stay here for the
night, but as soon as it was dark, we
heard such barks and growls, that
we thought we would not go on
shore 'till morn, when Xury said, that
if wild men or beasts came, he would
"give them shoot gun." He could
talk quite well, as he had been so
much with the white slaves that the
Turks had.
In the morn, Xury said that if I
would take the boat close up to the
shore, and give him one of the jars
we had with us, he would go and see
if there were springs near by, and
what he could find to eat. I said to
him, "Why should you go; why not
let me go?"
He said, in a way full of love, "If
wild mans come, they eat me, you
go way."
"Well Xury," said I, "we will both
go, and if wild mans come, we will
kill them—they shall not eat us."
When we were most up to the
land, a large beast came down to the
edge of the shore, and gave such a
loud- roar, that Xury cried out with
fear. I took up my gun and shot at
him, which sent him back with a cry
of pain. I knew I had hurt him,
but he fled to the woods and we saw
no more of him.
Chapter II.
We then brought the boat up on
shore, but for fear some harm might
come to it, I thought I would stay
near by and watch it, so Xury took
the gun and the jar, and went off to
the south; he soon came back with
the jar full, and on the end of his
gun a hare that he had shot, and
told me with great joy that he had
seen "no wild mans."
I then told Xury to cook our meal,
and when it was done, we sat down
and ate the hare, with some wild
fruit he had found, and the bread we
had left, and when we were through,
put off to sea once more.
As near as I could guess, the Cape
Verd isles were not far off, and I
made up my mind to keep close to
the coast, in hopes that I might fall
in with some ship which would take
me in, and I should be with friends
once more.
As we went up the coast, Xury,
whose eyes were more on the watch
than mine, saw a huge beast that lay
on his side near the shore. I told
Xury, "You shall go on shore and
kill him."
"Me kill! he eat me up with one
mouth," Xury said, in great fright.
I thought he might do us some
good and took up my gun and shot
at him. It did not kill him, but
broke his leg, at which he set up
such a loud roar, that Xury could do
nought for some time but stand and
gaze.
He said he must have some of
him, and told me to give him the
axe, and he would cut off his head;
he went on shore but he found he
could not take his head, so he came
back with one of his feet and a part
of the leg. I saw it was so large that
I thought I would like his skin, as it
would be of great use to me.
Xury and I went to work at him,
it took us both the whole day, but at
last we got the hide off of him, and
I let it hang for two days in the sun
to dry. I found it nice and soft to lie
on, and it made me a good bed.
In one place some black men came
down to the edge of the shore; one
of them had a long lance and the rest
held clubs and sticks. We were in
need of food and drink, and I thought
I would go up to them, but Xury
thought from signs they made, they
would like to kill us, and cried out
in great fear, "No go! No go!"
I had some of the beast we had
shot which I did not like to eat, so
I threw it to them, and made signs
that we would like some food. When
they saw that we did not mean to
hurt them, one of them went off, and
in less than half an hour came back
with fruit, dry meat, and a kind of
corn, but I did not know what it was,
as we did not raise that kind in our
part of the world. We did not know
how we should get these things, for
we did not want to go on shore, and
they did not like to come to us, but
at last they put them on the edge of
the shore and went off; we were glad
of this, for they were a wild set, and
wore no clothes.
We went on for ten or twelve days
more, but did not meet a ship, and
my heart was full and sad. I thought
we would starve, and that I should
die, and I could not help but feel
that it was all my own fault.
One day I gave Xury charge of
the ship, and sat down in one end, to
think what I should do, and how I
could get food, as we did not dare to
go on shore, for fear of wild men and
beasts. I was sad, and gave up all
hope, when all at once Xury cried,
"A ship with a sail." How my heart
rose with joy, but poor Xury did not
share it with me, he thought it was
the Turk who had come to take us
back. I saw that it was a large ship,
but could not tell where it was from.
They did not see us at first, so I took
a small flag that I had, and made a
waft of it, and shot off my gun for
a sign; they did not hear the gun,
but when they saw the smoke, they
brought to, and lay by for me, and
in less than two hours' time I came
up with them.
The ship was from Spain, and
bound for the south. A Scotch man
on board said to me, "Who are you,
and where are you from?"
I told him how I had run from
the Turk, and this he told the man
in charge, who said I must come on
board, and took both Xury and me,
as well as all my goods in his ship.
I was so sick of the sea, that I
thought, "when I reach the land I
will stay there"; and so when the man
said he would pay me for my boat,
and buy Xury from me, I told him
he could have the boat, but Xury had
been so good to me, that I would
not like to sell him for a slave.
He said, if Xury would be a good
boy, he would set him free in a few
years, and as I was at a loss to know
what I should do with him, I let the
man take him.
In a few weeks we came to the
coast of a large land, which lays
south-west of my own land, and there
I made up my mind to stay.
The gold the man gave me for my
boat and the things that were in it,
was quite a large sum, and I had ten
pounds at home with a friend, so I
thought I would buy a farm.
While I went to look round for
one, I met a man whose name was
Wells; he had some stock but not
much gold. He thought he would
like to buy a farm. He said to me,
that he thought if we would join our
means, we could buy a large farm
and make it pay us well. I saw that
he was a good man and knew how
to farm, so I sent to my friend for
my gold, and we bought a large farm
near the coast.
I now saw what a help Xury would
be to me, and I felt I had done wrong
to part with him, for in a short time
we had to buy two more slaves to
help us work our farm. The friend
who sent me my gold, sent with it
some cloth, baize, dress goods, and
some small wares, which I gave in
trade to the men where we were, and
to those who came on shore from the
ships that went by, and in a few
months I was in a fair way to make
a great deal of gold.
All went on well for four years, our
stock grew fast, and we were soon
quite rich, but this kind of a life did
not suit me, my old wish to roam
came on, and in spite of all I had
gone through each time I went to
sea, I felt I would like to go once
more. What more did I do here
than I would have done at home with
my friends, and was it for this that I
had left them all. No! I would go
off as soon as I could get a chance,
and do some great thing yet.
My kind friend who had brought
me here had been gone for some
time, and I felt bad that I had not
gone with him.
o
One day while I was in this mood,
three men came to me and said they
would like me to take a share in a
large slave ship they had, and go
to sea in it. I told them I would
go with all my heart, if they would
look out for my farm, which they
were glad to do. I made a sort of
will, in which I told the men what
to do with my share in the farm in
case of my death, and made the man
who had brought me here, and who
was so kind to me, my heir.
In a" few days I set sail, which,
strange to say, was just eight years
from the day I had left home.
We had on board six guns, and a
crew of ten men and five boys. Our
stock of goods was toys, beads, bits
of glass, shells, and such odd things,
that we knew we could trade for
slaves.
We soon lost sight of land, and
for two weeks the sea was calm, and
the air clear and hot, and then there
came a great change. One day there
blew up a great gale and a fierce
storm set in, and for three days we
could not steer the ship, she was
thrown round in such a way, and the
high seas that came on us took off a
man and a boy. In the midst of this
one of the men said he saw land, and
we thought we would try to reach it,
but it was of no use, and though we
did all we could, we could not save
the ship, it struck on a sand bar.
We could not move, and we could
not stay here, for we thought the ship
would break in two.
There was a small boat on the
ship, which the mate let down, and
we all got in, but did not have much
hope, as the sea was so wild and
rough, and the storm so great. We
felt that nought but God's care could
save us; we had gone but a short
way, when there rose a great high
wave that fell on our boat, and swept
us all out into the sea.
I was full of dread and fear, and
thought there was no hope for me, but
as I swam round, I saw, quite a way
off, a piece of land, which I thought
if I could reach I would be safe.
With the aid of the waves I swam
straight for it, and when there the
first thing I did was to thank God
for my life, and then to look for the
rest of the men, but they must have
y
all gone down, for I saw them no
more, nor a sign of them, but three
of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
which were not mates.
I knew it would not do for me to>
sit still here, but must get up and
look round me, and see what kind of
a place I was in, and as night was
near, how and where I should sleep.
It was too late to see much of the
place, but not far off I found a thick
tree like a fir, full of thorns. I thought
I woul(^ make this do to sleep in,
and though I saw no signs of them,
I was full of fear of wild men and
beasts, so I took my knife and cut
me a sharp stick, and when it was
dark I got up in my tree, where I
slept as well as I think few could
have done in my state.
When I woke up the next morn,
it was quite late, and the sun shone
bright and clear. I could see the
ship as it lay one.end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off, and the
small boat, which was lost, was so far
off I could but just see it. At noon
the sea was calm, and the tide low,
so that I could swim to the ship, and
as it was warm, I took off most of
my clothes and laid them on the sand,
and went to the ship.
Here I found fresh cause for grief,
for I saw if we had kept on board
we would all have been safe, that is
to say, we could all have got safe to
the land, and I would not have been
all that was left. At first I did not
know how to get up on the ship, but
when I had swam round her twice,
I spied a small piece of strong rope
that hung down on one side, and
with the aid of that, and hard work,
I at last got up on deck.
You may be sure that my first
work was to search for bread, which,
when I had found it, I made a good
meal off, and then I went to see what
else there was in the ship, that I could
take on shore.
• But how could I get them there?
I must have a boat to do this. The
small boat, as I have said, was too far
off, and there was none on the ship.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for
what was not to be had. I found
there were some spare yards, a mast
or two, some large spars of wood,
and some rope and planks. I thought
I would go to work and see what
I could do with these, so I took some
rope and put it round each of the
spars, and flung them in the sea, and
then I threw the planks down, and
when this was done, I went down
the ship's side, and put four of the
spars end to end, and with the rope
I made them as well as I could in
the form of a raft, and laid two or
three short planks on it. I found I
could walk on this, but it was too
light to bear a great weight. I then,
with a saw I had found, cut one of
the large masts in three lengths, and
put them to my raft
.
This took much time and toil, but
the fear that I would starve kept me
up. My raft was now quite strong
and large, and my next care was,
what to load it with, and how to save
31
what I put on it from the serf of the
sea. I first laid all the loose planks
and boards I could get on it, and
then I put on three chests which I
had found in one of the rooms of the
ship. I thought one of the chests
would be just the thing for me to put
my food in, as it would keep it dry,
so I put in it some bread, rice, cheese,
dry meat, and some corn, which had
been laid by for some fowls which
we brought to sea with us. I found
a large case of rum, but there was
no need to put that in the chest, so
I put it up by the side of it.
By this time the tide was up, and
though the sea was calm, 'I saw my
coat, vest, and shirt, which I had left
on the sand, float off. This made me
think of some clothes, and I went
down in the ship, and found some
that had been worn by the men, and
I took all that I thought I would
need for a time.
In the same room where the
clothes were, I found what was a
great prize to me, worth more than
a ship full of gold would have been
at that time, a chest with some tools
in it. I took it down to my raft,
whole as it was, as I did not have
time to look through it. I then went
for some arms. There were three
good guns, a bag of shot, -two old
swords, an old horn, and three kegs
of gun dust. The rest were so wet,
that I knew they would be of no use
to me.
CHAPTER IV.
I put all these things on my raft,
and then set off for the land. For a
time my raft went well; but as it
was so large, and I had so much on
it, I could not use my oars, and the
sea was so strong, that I was in fear
I would not reach the shore, but
drift out from it. So I had to sit
with my back to the chests to hold
them up, and wait for the tide to
come in, which it did in the course
of an hour, and sent my raft quite
high up on the shore, and here I
thought I should lose all my goods,
for it sent one end up so high, that
I thought all the rest would fall in
the sea, so I struck out my oars, and
thrust the raft off a short way, and
then stuck the oars in the ground,
one on each side of the raft near the
ends, which held it down straight,
and so that it could not move.
When I had brought my goods
upon the shore, I took out my pipe,
and sat down to smoke. I thought
of the past, of my friends at home; I
knew they would think me dead, and
mourn for me. I did not see how I
could send them word, or get off, for
the isle I was on did not seem to
have a soul on it. It was out of the
way of the course of ships and trade,
and though I could hear birds sing
and beasts cry, still I felt I was lost
to the world, and felt sad and sick at
heart.
While I sat here, a great bird flew
by me and I shot at it; I think it
was the first gun that had been shot
off on the isle, for the fowls and birds
flew out from all sides, and set up
loud cries of fright. The bird I took
to be from its beak a kind of hawk,
though its claws were not like nor
near as large as a hawk's; it was not
good for food, so I threw it on the
ground.
What to do, or where to rest this
night, I knew not. I did not like to
lie on the ground; my tree was too
far off, and I knew I must stay near
my goods to watch them; so I made
a kind of hut with the chests and
boards, and I laid down on some of
the boards, but I did not sleep well,
for the boards were hard, and I had
such great fear of wild beasts.
The food I had brought from the
ship I knew would last me some
days, and I had seen some hares run
out of the wood, where I had shot
the fowl; still I felt I should need
more food soon, and there was some
in the ship which would be of great
use to me, and I must get it on shore
as quick as I could, for the sea was
so strong at times I knew the ship
could not stand long.
The next morn, when the tide
went out, I swam to the ship.
My raft was so large that I left
that on shore, and thought I would
make a small one when I got on the
ship. I did so, and then went to
look through the ship. I found two
or three bags full of nails and spikes,-
some saws and knives, and, to my
great joy, a stone to grind my tools
with.
I took all the men's clothes I could
find, a spare top sail, and a bed. I
put these on my raft, and brought
them all safe to the shore.
I found my things just as I had
left them. A wild cat was up on
one of the chests; my first thought
was to shoot her, but as she did not
seem to mind me, I threw a piece of
dry rusk at her, which she ate, and
then ran off.
I then went to work to make a
small tent of some kind, where I
could stay and sleep, as well as store
my goods in. I put up one with the
sail and some poles I had cut, and
brought in all my things that I
thought the sun or rain would spoil.
I then stood all the chests and casks
round it, and made a door of some
boards and a chest. When this was
done, I spread out my bed, put my
arms close by, and, for the first time
since I had left the ship, I laid down
and slept well.
For the next six days, when the
tide was low, I went out to the ship,
and thought that I had found all
that I would need, but as long as
the ship was there, I felt that I must
take off all that I could get.
In one of my trips I put so much
on my raft, that it went down, and
threw me and my goods into the sea,
but it did not do much harm, for I
took most of the things out.
One day I found some gold; I
said, "Oh drug! what art thou good
for? Thou art not worth as much
as one of the knives in this heap,"
I made up my mind to throw it in
the sea, but then I thought, I may
need this some time, so I put it up
in a piece of sail, and laid it by in
the tent.
The last trip I made the wind
blew hard, and drove me out from
the shore; I was in fear that I would
not reach it, but by hard work, and
the aid of the tide, I got on land all
safe, and I put up all my goods, for
I knew there would be a storm.
It blew hard all night, and the
next morn, when I woke, I saw that
the ship was gone. I felt sad, and
as though I had lost a friend, but I
knew that I had brought on shore
all that I could use now, and so I
soon gave up all thoughts of her.
As the spot my tent was on was not
a fit place for me to live, the ground
was so low and wet, I went out to
search the isle, to see if I could find
a dry place, from which I could view
the sea, or see when a ship came in
sight
I found a plain on the side of a
hill, with a large rock near by; a
hole was worn in the rock like a door
to a cave, and there was a flat green
in front of this hole. I thought I
could fix the place where the hole
was to put my food in, and I would
build my tent in front of it on the
green.
I went right to work. First I drove
two rows of large stakes (the space
of ten yards from the rock), so close
that they stood firm like piles, and
then with some of the rope I had,
I made the stakes tight, and then I
put some of the boards and planks
on to them, and in this way I made
a strong fence that would keep out
both man and beast.
I then built my tent, in fact two
of them, a small one first, with a large
one round it, and I put one of my
thick sails on the top of the large
one. The way into this place was
from the top, by means of a pair of
steps I had made, which I could pull
in with me when I went in. When
it was all done, I brought all my
goods and stores in here.
Chapter V.
I went out at least once a day
with my gun, to see what I could kill
that would be fit for food. One day
I saw some goats, but they were so
shy that it was hard work to get
near to them.
The first shot I made, I shot an
old goat with a small kid, that stood
near by, and when the old one fell,
the kid stood stock still, till I came
up to her. I felt so sad that I laid
the old dam down and took the kid
up in my arms to pet her, and I
thought if I could I would bring her
up and tame her, but she would not
eat, so I had to kill her.
The flesh of these two goats kept
me in food for a long time, for which
I was glad, as I did not want to eat
up all my bread, for though it was
dry and hard, I did not see how I
was to get more when this was gone.
In a few weeks more I found a
young kid that was lame, and I led
her by a string to my tent. I took
great care of her, and by the time
she was well, she was quite tame. I
soon had a chance to catch some
more, and it was not long when I
had quite a flock of goats, and all
the milk I could use.
My great thought, night and day,
was how should I live. What could
I do, way off here in this lone isle?
The tears would run down my face,
and I would say, "Oh! how I dread
this lone life." Then the thoughts
would come: "Well, you are here,
but where are the rest? Why is it
that you were not lost? Is it best to
be here or in the sea?" And I would
make up my mind to wait, and watch
for a ship, and that if I was to go
back home, it would be all in good
time.
As the days went by, I must make
a note of time, or I should lose sight
of the days and years, but I did not
know how to do it, for want of books,
pens, and ink; so with my knife I
made out of some posts a great
cross, and set it up near the shore.
I put on it, "I came here the first of
Sept., 165pr" and each day I cut a
notch, so I could tell the days of the
week, month, and year.
I did not have to lie in my bed
all the time. I had found a swing in
one of the rooms of the ship, which
had been the mate's, and in this I
would sleep in place of my bed.
I did not tell you of the two cats
that I brought in my arms from the
ship, nor of the dog who swam to
the shore with me at the same time.
The dog was a great pet, and a true
friend for years; he would hunt for
things and bring them to me; he
would do a great deal, but could not
talk. I thought, if he could but
speak to me and tell me his thoughts,
and I could tell him mine, how glad
I should be!
My tent was so small that I could
not get at half of my goods, which
lay in a heap on the floor; so I took
down the small one, and one side of
the large one, and built it out for a
long way, and then I had a chance
to look well at my goods.
In a box which I had brought
from one of the rooms in the ship,
I found what made my heart jump
for joy—a lot of blank books, pens,
and some ink. The ink I knew I
should have to use with great care,
for I could not make more when
this was gone, but I made up my
mind while I had it, I would write
down each night all that I saw, and
what took place through the day, as
well as the good and bad thoughts
of the day.
This gave me great peace of mind.
My book grew to be, to me, like a
friend I could talk to, and I soon
saw that we all have more cause for
joy than grief, if we will but look in
the right light at what is sent us, and
that I should be full of thanks to
God, who was so good to me, when
I had done so much that was wrong,
and left all at home, just to have my
own way.
The next thing now for me to do
was to make a chair to sit on, and a
stand to write and read by, as well
as to eat from. These I made out
of the short boards I had brought
on my raft from the ship. I could
not build much at a time, as I had
so few tools, When I was in need
of a board, I had to cut down a tree
and set it on edge by me, hew it flat
on both sides with my axe, and then
rub it smooth with my adze, and I
could make but one board from a tree.
When I had wrought out some
boards in this way I made some
large shelves, and put them up all
round on the sides of my tent. I
laid all my tools and nails, and such
goods as I could, on them, and hung
up my guns, and soon had my things
where I could get at them, and could
keep them and my tent neat and
clean.
Each day, when I was through
with my work, I would walk up to
the top of the hill, to see if there was
a ship or sail in sight, and when I
came back, would sit down and cry
like a child; my dog and cats would
come up to me and lick my hands,
and look at me in such a way as
though they would like to help me,
which would soothe me a great deal.
I wrote my notes for a year, and
then had to stop, as my ink gave out,
and I had no way to get more; but
those that I wrote were a great help
to me all the time I was on the isle.
One day I caught some wild birds,
a kind of dove, which I thought I
would tame. I did so, and their flesh
made good food. As time wore on,
I found I would need some more
lights, for when it was dark I had to
go to bed. I had some goats' fat,
which I made soft by the fire, and
then I made a wick to put in it from
a piece of old rope, and with the aid
of the sun to dry it, I made a small
dish of clay, and in this way I had
a lamp, and quite a good light.
I had some corn left, which was so
dry that I thought I could not use
it, but the bag would be good to
keep some of my things in; so I
threw the corn out on the ground.
o
In a few days the rains set in for a
month, and when they were through,
I saw one day a few green stalks;
they were quite small, and I did not
know what they were; but what was
my joy in a week's time, to find that
it was the corn which had sprung up;
and when that same day I took my
walk, I found on sides of the rock,
young stalks of rice, and a small
grain which grows quite thick in
some lands; but how it came here I
could not tell, for this was not the
right soil or place for it.
CHAPTER VI.
One day I was at work in my tent,
when I felt a great shock; the earth
shook so hard that I thought the top
of my tent would fall in; one of the
posts gave way, and I was in great
fear. I ran out to see what was the
cause of this. I found the ground
loose, and the dirt and stones thrown
up all round; then I knew it was
one of those shocks that I had
heard take place on the isles in the
South. The shock was just as strong
on the sea, for it threw the ship quite
high up on one end, near the shore.
When the shock came, I thought
that I would have to seek a new place
for my tent; but the sight of the
wreck drove these thoughts out of
my mind, for I felt that I must see
what I could bring from the wreck.
I knew I should need all I could find.
I went each day for a month. There
was not much in the ship that I could
use, as it had lain so long in the sea;
but with the aid of my axe and claw,
I brought back all the planks and
boards I could get loose.
On one of these trips, as I came
up the hill, I spied a great crab on
its back in the sun; I caught it, and
the eggs and flesh were to me the
best food I had had since I came on
the isle.
The rain came on for a few days,
and I felt cold, which I thought was
strange, as I ought not to feel cold
here, for as near as I could make out,
the isle was not far from the Line.
The next day I had a hard chill, and
then a great heat with faint sweats,
and for two weeks I was quite ill. I
was too ill to use my gun, and most
dead with thirst; I was too weak to
go out to get a drink, and as I lay
on my bed, my whole thought was,
"What shall I do?" All that I had
gone through had not made me pray
or think of God, as I should have
done. When I found the green corn,
I did think for a while that it was
one more proof of God's love, but my
heart was hard, and I soon let the
cares of each day take up my mind,
and did not stop to bless or thank
Him.
One night I had a strange dream:
I saw a great black cloud, and back
of it a bright flame, which shone on
the ground, and a man came out of
the cloud; his face shone like fire,
and he held a spear in his hand; the
earth shook and the air was full of fire.
The man said to me: "Thou wilt not
pray, nor turn and love me, now thou
shalt die;" and he took up his spear
as if he meant to kill me. I gave a
cry and a start, which woke me up.
This led me to think of my sins,
of my friends at home, and what they
had told me when a boy, and that it
was all my own self will that had
brought me here lone and sick; and
yet God had been so good to me to
save my life, and I thought, "He
sees and knows all things; He can
cure me; I will pray to Him and learn
to love Him."
The next day I was quite weak
and ill at ease; my fit did not come
on, but the dream was in my mind.
I made a search for that best of all
books, God's Word, and found it in
one of the chests. The first words
that I read were, "Call on me, I will
help thee;" and I knelt down and
sent up the cry, "Son of God, be with
me; help me to love Thee and teach
me to pray."
This was the first time since a child
that I knelt down to pray to God,
with a sense that He was near, and
that He would hear and help me.
My mind was now at ease, and that
night I laid down and slept well, and
when I woke the next morn I felt
quite well.
I read my book night and morn,
and I soon found that I had a dear
Friend, to whom I could go and get
peace.
I had heard when I was on my
farm, that to take the weed men
smoke, and put it in some rum to
steep, and then to drink the rum, it
would cure the chills; so I made
some of this, and took a dose of it
for a day or two, and it did work a
cure for me, as I was sick no more
while I was on the isle.
I thought of the shock that took
place, and when the rain was gone,
and I grew strong, I made up my
mind that it was best for me to make
a tour of the isle, and see if I could
find a good place where I could go in
case there should be more of them, as
well as to see what I could get to eat.
-
It is true I had the flesh of the
goats and birds, and the eggs of the
large crabs I found, but my bread
was gone, and I was sick of these.
I brought my raft on the shore,
out of the reach of the tide and
waves, and went on foot up the creek
for two miles, where I found that the
tide did not flow, and the sea ran in
a small brook, which was fresh and
clear, and on the banks of this brook
the grass grew thick and green.
There was a small ridge of hills
near here, and a fresh spring rose
out of the side of one of the hills, and
lime trees and grape vines grew on
all sides. The grapes were in their
prime, ripe and sweet.
In front of the hills there was a
smooth green plain, with plants and
fruit vines that ran on the ground,
The place had such a charm for me,
and it was so high up on the isle,
that I felt it would be a good spot
to stay and rest for a few days. I
thought it best to put up some sort of
a place to sleep in; I was still weak
and could not do much, but I built
a small hut of green brush and leaves.
The first night I did not sleep
well, I was so far from my tent, and
I thought of my pets and goods that
I had left there.
I spent two or three days here, and
then went back to my tent, where I
found all things safe. I took with
me all the fruit I could bear, and
hung the grapes in the sun to dry
them; and when I took them down
they were sweet and good, and I saw
that I could keep them for a long
time.
I found, by my post, that I had
been on the isle for one year, and had
seen no signs of a ship yet. I made
up my mind that I should have to
dwell here for a long time, and must
think of how I should live, and what
was best for me to do.
I thought I would like some bread,
but to have this I must have the
meal, and to get the meal I must
raise the corn and grain. But I had
no tools to work with; and how
could I do all this? I dug up the
ground with a spade I had made of
wood, as I had no plow, and took
the bough of a tree for a rake, and
with these I put in a part of the
corn, some rice, and the small grain,
a few stalks of which I had found
on the isle.
They did not yield much the first
year, as it was sown too late, and the
next year, the hares would tread it
down at night, and the birds would
eat it in the day time; I made a trap
to catch the birds and set my dog to
hunt the hares, and I put a hedge
all round the field, which kept out
my goats, and at the end of the third
year I had a good crop of all that
was sown.
My goats would stray off, and go
with the wild ones, and it took me
some time to hunt them up and tame
them, so I laid out a large piece of
ground to keep them in, and put a
thick hedge around it, and put up
small pens to drive them in; and at
w.rtiQHrtsf'
the end of a year and a half, I had a
flock of twelve goats, kids and all,
and in two years more, two score and
three. It took me three months to
plant my hedge and put up a pole
or fence by it, but this was a help to
me to pass my time, for the days
were long and drear.
You would smile were you to see
me and my pets sit down to dine.
First, there I was, prince and lord
of the whole isle, and Poll on the
back of my chair, and my dog at
my feet, with my cats on each side
of me, all on the watch lor the bits
that I would feed them from my
hands.
I did not have much time to sit
still through the day, for it could,
with truth, be said of me, "With the
sweat of thy face, shalt thou eat
bread;" but when the day's work
was done, I would sit in the door of
my tent, with my dog on one side
of me, the cats at my feet, and Poll
on my hand.
Poll was a young bird I had
caught, and I took a great deal of
pains to teach her to talk, and the
first time she spoke her name, it gave
me a great start, I had hot heard a
voice but my own for so long.
As I now had so much corn and
rice, I thought of my bread.
I sat one day for a long time to
think how I should grind my corn
and bake my bread. First, I must
have some pots or jars to keep my
meal in. I thought of my clay
lamp, and went to work to make
a sort of paste with the clay and
sand that was on the beach. You
would laugh were I to tell you the
ways I took to make this paste, and
what odd things I made; how some
of them fell in and some fell out,
and some would crack with the heat
of the sun, but I kept on, and at
last, with the aid of the sun to bake
them, I had two large pots to keep
my meal in.
Though these were quite dry and
hard, I saw that they were not strong.
I could not bake or cook in them,
nor use them for half of my things.
One day a piece fell in the fire, and
when I took it out I found it was
burnt as hard as a stone, and as red
as a tile. I now made up my mind
to-»burn all my pots, and in a few
weeks I had a nice lot of large jars,
round pots, and a flat dish. How
glad I was, now I could bake bread,
boil meat, and make some broth.
I now sought the means to grind
my corn and grain for meal. I had
no mill, so I thought I would stamp
or beat it out. I spent a great deal
of time to find a stone, but as I could
not get one, I took a great "block of
hard wood, and with my axe and
knife cut a deep hole in it. I put my
grain in this hole, and with a short,
thick piece of wood beat it out fine.
The next thing was a sieve to dress
my meal, and part it from the bran
and husk. I had no goat's hair, nor
could I weave it if I had. This put
a stop to my work for some weeks;
but one day I found a piece of thin
cloth (such as men wear round their
necks for ties), which I had brought
from the ship. With this I made
three small sieves, and these I made
last for some years.
Now that my grain was ground,
and I had meal, I could make bread,
but how was I to bake it? I had
made some square red tiles, and put
them all round my fire, like a hearth;
I built a large fire, and when it was
all burnt up to live coals, I drew
them out on the tiles, and put my
dough in a broad flat dish, and set it
s
on the hot tiles, and in a short time
I had a nice loaf of bread. I now
had all the fresh bread and rice cakes
I could eat.
I had now been on the isle four
years, and still no ship came by. I
could see a piece of land some way
off from the isle, and each day I
would look at it and long to go on
it, and see what there was there; but
fear of the wild men, that I thought
might live there, kept me back. If
Xury were with me, was now my
great wish; how much he could help
me! or if I had a boat, I could do so
well.
I thought I would go and look at
our ship's boat, which had been blown
up on the shore, a great way off. I
found that she lay up in such a way
that I could not turn her; and I saw
that I would have to do so much to
her, that it would be best for me to
make a new one. To do this, I cut
down a large tree, and took the trunk
and made it in shape with my axe
and adze.
I did not stop to think how I
should get it to the sea. I thought,
"Let me first make it and I will find
a way." It took me three months of
toil to do this, but I did not mind
that. I was full of hope, and thought
what a good time I should have,
and how I would sail off in it.
When it was hewn out, fit for me
to launch, it was so large, that do all
I would, I could not move it. I
thought I would dig a trench round
it, and see if I could slide it out to
sea, but it was of no use; so I left it
to go back to work on my farm, and
I felt that I must make up my mind
to end my days here.
I had large flocks of goats, good
crops of corn and grain, in fact all
that I could eat, and the means to
cook with. The most I stood in need
of now was clothes. I had worn out
all that I had brought from the ship,
and I was now in rags. When I
would kill a goat or kid, I would
save the skin, and hang it in the
sun to dry, and in this way I had
quite a large stock of nice skins.
The first thing I made of these was
a great cap for my head, and I made
this so well, that I made a whole
suit. I put the hair of the skin out,
so that it would shed the rain. The
coat was long and loose, and made
fast to the waist with a belt.
The next thing to make was a sort
of shade, to take with me when I
went out, to shield me from the sun
and rain. I made a frame and put
a skin on it, but though I could
make it spread, I had hard work to
make it let down; but I did it at
last, and found it of great use to
me.
If you could have seen me when
I went out to walk, you would say
that I had no need to be vain, and
that I did not have to use a glass to
fix my clothes, but they were the
best I could get.
One year more went by, and this
I think was one of the best ones I
spent on the isle. I had been well
all the time, and grew strong; my
crops were fine, my pets were all
round me, and I had time to read
God's Word night and morn; but
with these I could not keep my
thoughts from a boat, and I went to
work to make a small one. The last
one was in my mind, and I took
great care to build this one the
right size, and not too far from the
edge of the sea.
When it was done, I put a mast
and sail on it, and made a place to
stow my arms and food in. I put
my shade on One end to shield me
from the hot sun. I took a short
sail out, and I had such a good time
that I thought in a few days I would
take a long sail. So one morn, I
put my gun and some food with a
case of rum in the boat, and set out
to view the isle, and see all that lay
round it. This was in the sixth
year of my reign on the isle.
CHAPTER VIII.
When I had been out three days,
a great gale came up and drove me
out to sea, and I thought that I with
my boat would be lost. The fourth
day the wind went down some, and
I put on all my sail, and the wind
and tide took me up on the end of
the isle a great way from home.
Here I left the boat, and had to walk
home; and when I came to my place,
I was so worn out that I laid down
in the shade of one of my trees and
fell in a deep sleep.
You may judge of my fright when
I was woke from my sleep by a voice
that said, "Who are you?" "Where
have you been?"
At first I thought I was in a
dream; but when I saw Poll on the
top of the hedge, I knew it was her
voice I heard. These were some of
the words I had taught her, to cheer
me when I was sad.
For some time I kept at home,
but one day I thought I would walk
down and take a look at the boat.
When quite near it I saw the print
of a man's foot in the sand—toes, heel,
and all parts of a foot. I went up
and down the shore, but saw no one.
I went back to my tent as fast as
I could. I could not sleep that
night, and for three days kept close
in doors, but the want of food drove
me out. I took a look all round,
and as I saw no one, I thought the
mark I had seen might be the print
of my own foot which I had left
there at some time, but still I could
not get rid of my fear.
How queer men are! to-day we
love, the next day we hate. Had
not all my grief been that I was here,
with no friends, none to talk to but
my pets? And now when I thought
a man might be near, why should I
shake with fear?
One morn as I took up my book
to read, I saw the words, "Wait on
the Lord, be of good cheer, I will
give thee strength; wait, I say, on
the Lord." I thought of these words
for some time, and then I knelt down
to pray God to take care* of me and
give me peace.
I felt that I must fix my tent as
well as my goods and flocks in a
more safe way than they were. I
made some holes in the ground some
way off from my hedge, and drove
large posts in them, and with old
boards and planks I built a high
wall; and a short way from this, I set
out some young trees, which I knew
would grow fast, and at the end of
two years I had a thick grove all
round, which hid my place from
view.
Two or three years more went by
and I saw no signs of men, and
thought that the print of a man's foot
was not so great a thing, and that I
had been weak to feel so much fear.
I now felt at ease, and would take
short sails in my boat, and take walks
on the shore.
One day I went up to the top of
a hill to look at the sea; I thought I
saw a boat, but it was so far off that
it did not look like more than a speck,
but as I did not have a glass with
me could not make it out. I went
on down the hill to a part of the isle
where I had not been, when I saw
close to the edge of the shore, a pit
where there had been a fire made,
and all round were strewn skulls,
hands and feet, and burnt bones of
men.
At the sight of these I grew sick,
and went up the hill with all the
speed I could, and when I came to
my tent burst in a flood of tears.
This was the first true sign of men.
But what kind of men, I thought—
a wild set, that will eat me up if they
find me. My whole mind, by night
as well as day, was how shall I get
rid of them? But what could I do
with two or three score of them,
with their darts and bows, with
which they could shoot as true to a
mark as I could with my gun? I
thought of my gun dust, and that
I might blow them up; in fact, I
thought of all sorts of ways, but none
of them would do. The best thing
for me to do was to load my gun,
and stay at home and watch.
I took my boat up in a safe place,
and brought sail and masts, with all
the things that were in her, home to
my tent, so that if they came they
could not take them off. I kept on
the watch for them all the time, and
each day would go up to the top of
the hill to see if they were there, but
did not see them, nor a sign of them,
for a long while, as I. will show
you.
I thought if a ship would come
that way, then there would be help
for me. But none came. I did not
dare to drive a nail, or chop a stick,
for fear of the noise, or make a fire
for fear the wild men would see the
smoke.
I had more care of my life now
than for my food; but I soon found
that to live I must eat, and I must
bake my bread and cook my meat.
So I went in the wood to cut down
some small trees (to make a fire
of), and while I was there I saw
back of a thick branch of low brush
a large hole, and in this hole two
large bright things like eyes, which
sent a flash on me. I took up a
small stick of wood that was on fire,
and went to see what it was. As I
came up I heard a sigh, and then a
slight noise. This put me in a cold
sweat, but I went on, and when I
came close to the hole I saw that it
was an old goat that had gone in
there to die. I found the hole to be
the mouth of a cave. Just then my
fire went out, and the place was so
low that I thought I would not go
in then, but wait till the next day.
The next morn I took six lights
with me and went to the cave. I
had to creep in, on my hands and
knees, through a sort of strait for ten
feet. When I got through this, I
saw that the roof rose up high, and
that I could stand up; and what a
grand sight now met my view!
When I threw my lights round, the
roof and sides shone like gems, gold
and bright stars. I stood for some
time lost in thought.
I had been on the isle for so long,
and this was the first I knew of this
strange and great place, and yet it
was so near my tent! Where could
I find more proof of God's might
and care than this? The cave was
twelve feet wide, and quite dry, and
I thought this would be a safe place
for me. It would hold all my arms,
gun dust, and such things as I would
need; and the mouth was so small
that the wild men would not think
to look in for me, and if they did,
would have to come one at a time,
and I could get rid of them by use
of my arms. I took care to bring
in all I might want as soon as I
could, and felt that I had found a
safe place to hide in, and I could
live there for some time.
Now for the first time I thought
how dear to me were all the'things
round me. My Polls, for I had two
or three, would call me by name as
soon as I came in; my dog and cats
would bark and purr round me; my
tame birds would light on my head
and back, and I had no fears for want
of food and drink. All would have
been peace with me if it had not been
for my great dread of the wild men.
And must I now give up all to them
and die? No! that I would not do
if I could help it. I made up my
mind that if the wild men came I
would flee to my cave, and do all
that I could to save my life. So I
went back to my work on the farm
and the care of my flocks; and felt
that God, who had done so much for
me, would help and save me.
In a few months from this time
my good old dog fell dead, right
near the door of my tent. This
made me feel sad for a long time.
6
In this way five or six more years
went by, and I saw no more signs
of the men, and I thought it might
have been mere chance that had
brought them on the isle, and that I
had done wrong to fret so much;
but one day, on my way home from
my walk up the hill, I saw a smoke,
and as near as I could judge two
miles down, and this time on my
side of the isle.
I ran back to the top of the hill,
and laid down flat, and took a good
look at the place where it came from.
I saw that there was quite a large
fire, with nine men round it. I could
not tell just what they were at; but
tHought, no doubt, the fire was to
cook the food they had brought with
them. There were two small boats
on the edge of the shore, in which
they had come. As soon as the tide
Went out, they all got in the boats
and went off.
I went down to the spot, and saw
from the bones and skulls that lay all
round, that they had come here to
have one of their feasts. I went
back to my farm, and took up all
that grew round my place that would
lead them to think I was there, and
made it look as wild as I could. I
took in my steps, and I then sat
down in my tent to think what I
should do. I knew that the time
had come for me to act. I grew
bold, and felt that I must get rid of
them. I would watch for them, and
if they came and found me, I would
fight them off. I took two of my
guns, and put them through some
holes I made in the fence, and kept
them so I could fire on them as soon
as they came up.
Of course, for a long time I did not
do much on my farm. I had food,
and my goats gave me all the milk I
could drink, and I kept close watch
for near a year for the men.
One night in the spring the wind
blew hard, and I knew we should
have a storm. I put up all my things
for the night, took in my guns, and
sat down in my tent to read God's
Word, when I heard a gun, and in
a short time I heard it once more.
This I knew was not the wild men,
but thought that it came from some
ship at sea which was in need of
aid.
I ran to the top of the hill, in hopes
that if it were so I could see them,
or they could see me, and I built a
large fire, as a sign for them; but the
wind blew so that it was hard to keep
my fire up, and it was so dark that I
could not see a thing; but I kept
on as well as I could till the next
morn, when to my great grief I saw
that it was a ship which had struck
on the same sand where our ship
had been lost. I could not tell if
there were men in it or not. Now
for the first time in years I got my
boat down, and put the mast and
sail in it, and as much food and
drink as I thought I would need,
and put my large shade in one end,
and then set sail for the ship.
I did not think of the wild men.
All my hope now was to see if I
could save the lives of some of those
who might be on board; and so
great was this hope, that I could
scarce wait to reach the ship. To
hear and speak to a man of my own
kind was the great wish of my heart.
In less than two hours I came up to
it; but all was still. A dog that
was on deck was all that was left in
the ship that had life. He came at
me with a cry and bark, and was
most dead for food and drink. I
gave him some bread, and a drink
from a jar I had with me, and then
I put him in my boat. The wind
and force of the waves had torn the
ship's sails, and the ship had struck
the sand in such a way, it was most
split in two.
I went down to search the rooms,
and found in one of them two dead
men, but the rest were gone. My
thought was, where? Had they
gone off in a small boat and found a
safe place, or had they gone down
in the sea? In one of the rooms there
were three large chests, some clothes,
but not much that would be of use to
me, as most of the goods and stores
were spoilt by the sea. There were
some large casks of wine and rum
down in the hold of the ship, but
they were too large for me to lift;
but I found two chests, a good spy
glass, three large flasks, a pair of
tongs, a small pot, and some good
shirts. I put all these in my boat.
From all that I saw, I knew that the
ship had a great deal of wealth on
board, and I think was bound for
some place on the southwest coast
to get gems.
I now went back to the isle. I
had been gone three days, but I
found all my things as I had left
them, that is, my goats, cats and
birds.
When I came to look in the chests
I found in one of them three large
bags of gold; but what good was
that to me? I would give it for
some good shoes or socks, or some
seeds from home; but I laid it by
with the rest I had, in hopes that at
some time it might help me to get
home, or aid me when I was there.
I had been here a score and four
years, and most of the time had been
spent in peace, and I had made up
my mind to stay and die here. My
farm and pets had kept me at work
most of the time, and, as I have said,
if it had not been for the few times
the wild men came, I should have
felt that I had more cause for joy
than some men in my own land.
But the sight of the wreck and men
of my own kind wrought a great
change in me. I would sit and
think of the wild men, that if they
came, they would kill me; then I
would look at the wreck, and I
said: "Here was a ship that had
come near the shore, and why might
there not more come?" I could
not work. I lost my faith and trust.
I thought I would take my boat and
go out to sea, and that by chance I
might drift out in way of some ship
that would take me in.
For a year and a half I was full of
these wild thoughts, and I would go
out and watch by the hour, for both
the wild men and a ship. I did not
do much else but cook my food, milk
my goats, and feed my flocks and pets.
I had corn, rice, grain, and fruit, that
I knew would last for some time.
One morn, I went out to see to
my boat, when I saw five small boats
on the shore, quite close by, and near
them full three score black men.
I ran home and put up all my
things as safe as I could, and stuck
my axe and sword in my belt, took
my gun and my glass, and went up
to the top of the hill to watch them.
I saw that they had a fire and some
kind of meat, but I could not tell
what it was. They all sat down as
I thought to eat it.
Chapter X.
When they were through, I saw
some of them get up and dance in
their way round the fire, while some
went off; they soon came back, and
brought with them two slaves, bound
hand and foot. They took off their
bands, and left one to stand while
they went to work to cut one up.
When the first one found he was
free, he ran off, and straight in the
road to my house. When the rest
saw him run, they all gave full chase.
This put me in a great fright, for
I did not want them to reach my
place. I went down to my tent,
with all the speed I could, and got
one more gun. I thought "I will
try to save the poor man if I can."
There was a small creek through
which he would have to swim to
reach me, and I went down to it. I
found that all but two had gone
back (as the rest could not swim),
and the poor slave was quite close to
me. I did not like to fire, for I did
not want the rest to hear; so I made
a sign to the slave to come up to me,
and then I went up to the men. The
first one I gave a hard knock with
the end of my gun, and he fell as
though dead at my feet. The one
that was left then took aim at me
with his bow, and to save my own
life I had to fire. I shot him dead.
The fire and noise of my gun gave
the poor slave such a fright that he
could not move, and I thought he
might get back in their hands; so I
made signs to him to come to me,
and that I would not hurt him. He
came to me and knelt down and
gave the ground a kiss, and then
took my feet in his hands, and gave
them a kiss, to let me know that he
would be my slave. The man that
I thought was dead now rose up.
I saw that he was not much hurt,
but would soon get up on his feet;
when the slave made a sign that he
would like to cut off his head. I
gave him my sword, and he ran up
to him and cut off his head as quick
as a flash, and brought it to me and
put it down on the ground by me,
with a laugh. I did not like this,
for I thought my life was not safe
with such a man. When this was
done, he made a hole in the sand
with his hands, and put the two men
in it, so that the rest could not see
them if they should come back.
I now told him by signs to come
with me, and we went to my place.
I did not care to take him to my
tent, but went with him to my cave.
Here I made a bed of rice straw
for him, and then gave him some
food and drink, when he laid down
and went to sleep.
I could now take a good look at
him. I saw that he was well made,
tall and good shape, with straight
strong limbs. His hair was long
and black, but did not curl; he had
a small nose, a good mouth, with
thin lips, and firm, white, well set
teeth. His skin was not as black as
the men that came with him, but
more of a light brown; and as he lay
there his face wore a sweet smile.
I went out to milk my goats, and
put up some things for the night, and
while I was at this he woke up, and
came out to me, and made all sorts
of signs that he would like to wait
on me; and at last he lay his head
down flat on the ground close by my
feet, and took one of them in his
hand and laid it on his head, and
made a sign to me that he would
serve me as long as he should live.
I let him know that I was glad, and
then I taught him a few words and
my name. I could not tell what his
name was; but I thought I would
call him from the name of the day
on which I had found him, which was
Friday. I took a great deal of pains
to make him know what I meant. I
sent him back to the cave, and I
slept there with him all night.
The next morn I led him up to
the top of the hill, to see if the men
had come back; but there were no
signs of them, and we went back to
my tent, where I got three guns,
some shot, a bow and a sword. I
gave Friday some of these to take
with him, and we went to the spot
where the men had been. I saw
three skulls, five hands, the bones of
three or four feet and legs, and a lot
of small bones. I told Friday to
pick them all up, and lay them in
a heap, and set fire to them and
burn them up, and I made signs
to him that he must not eat the flesh
of men; if he did I would shoot him.
When we had done this I went back
to my tent, and I went to work to see
if I could make him some clothes.
I found some things in one of the
chests, and I made him a goat skin
coat and a hare skin cap. At first
he said they hurt him, and that he
could not walk in them, and he went
round ill at ease; but in a few days
he said they were nice and all right,
and was quite proud to think his
clothes were as good as mine.
7
For some time 1 did not feel quite
sure in my mind, that I could trust
my life with Friday, and took all
sort of means to fix my tent up safe;
but there was no use for this, for I
found him full of love and true to
me, and that he would give up his
life for me, as I will show you by
and by.
I soon found that, to cure Friday of
his taste for men's flesh, he must have
some kind of meat, and I thought I
would teach him to kill and dress
game for both him and me. One
day I took him out to shoot and
hunt with me. It hought I would
kill a kid of my own flock and dress
it, but as we went to the wood, I saw
an old goat with two kids. I caught
hold of Friday, and said, "Stand
still," and made signs to him not to
stir. I took up my gun, and shot one
of the kids. Poor Friday did not
know what to do; he shook life a leaf
in the wind, and I thought he would
sink to the ground. He came up to
me and knelt down by me, as if to
pray to me not to kill him. I saw
that I must find a way to show him
that I would do him no harm. I
took him up by the hand and told
him to bring me the kid, and in a
short time I saw a bird, and I made
signs to him that I would shoot it
and it would fall. I did so. This
made Friday stand and look for a
long time. I told him to pick it up;
he took it in his hand, and then gave
it to me; he had such a queer look
on his face, as if to say, "Well, if
you will not kill me, that thing you
have there will do it." He would
not touch the gun for some days, but
would go up to it and talk to it, and
pray to it not to kill him. In a few
weeks this fear wore off, and he would
take the gun and go out to shoot and
hunt as well as I did.
Chapter XI.
When we got home I made some
broth of a part of the kid, and took
the rest to roast; and when I had
fed Friday with the meat and broth,
he made signs to me that he thought
it was good, and that he would eat
man's flesh no more, which I was
glad to hear. He would not eat
salt with his food, but would make
a face as if he were sick when he saw
me eat it.
The next day I set him to work
to beat and sift some corn for me,
and then I let him see me make my
bread and bake it ; and in a few
weeks Friday could do all my work
as well as I could.
As I had now two mouths to feed
I knew I would have to raise more
grain, and this would make more
work on my farm. I told Friday
he must help, which he was glad to
do, for his whole mind was, what
he could do to show his love for me.
What joy there was now for me!
Here was some one I could teach
and talk to; no more of those lone
drear hours for me. I thought I
would like to know how he came to
be with those men, and if he would
like to go back to his own land; so I
said to him:
"How is it that you were in the
hands of those men that brought you
here?"
F. "There was a great fight with
their tribe and my tribe, and my
king had to give up, and they take
me with a lot more men, and make
us slaves and bring us here to eat
us up."
R. "Could not your tribe fight
and beat them?"
F. "Yes, yes, we fight the best;
but they more than my tribe in the
place where me was."
R. "But why did not your tribe
get you from their hands then?"
F. "They run one, two, three and
me, and make me go in the boat.
My tribe have no boat at that
time."
R. "Well, Friday, what does
your tribe do with the men they
take? Do they take and eat them
as these did?"
F. "Yes, my tribe eats mans too;
eat all up."
R. "Where do they take them?"
F. "Go to place where they think."
R. "Do they come here?"
F. "Yes, they come here; come
else place too."
R. "Have you been here with
them?"
F. "Yes, I been here" (and points
to the N. W. side of the isle, which
it seems was their side).
He then told me that a great way
back of the moon (he meant in the
west), there were white men, and
that I might go to them if I had
"two boat." At first I did not
know what he meant, but found that
he meant a ship as large as two
boats. This was good news for me,
and I made up my mind that, with
Friday's help, I would make a large
ship, and try once more to get off.
I thought I would like to know
who the tribes were that he spoke
of; but all I could get out of him
was "Cribs," by which I knew he
meant those tribes that dwell on the
large isles which lie south of that
great land east of my own.
One day I thought I would teach
him who the true God was. I said
to him: "Do you know who made
you, the sea, land, moon and stars?"
He said it was an old, old man, who
was old when the sun, moon, sea and
land were made.
I said to him: "If this old man
made all things, why do not all things
pray to him?"
With a grave look, he said: "All
things say O! to him."
I. then said: "Where do the men
who die in your land go to?"
He said "To the old man."
"And do those you eat up go
there too?"
He said "Yes."
I then told him of God, how He
made and took care of us, and sent
His Son to die for us, and teach us
to pray, and that He could, hear
us way up in the sky, and that
He would keep us from the bad
one, who made us think and do
wrong.
He said that if God could hear so
far off, He had more might and could
do more than the old man; and if He
was so strong and had so much
might, why did He not kill the bad
one who was the cause of so much
sin?
At this I could not say a word;
but felt that I must pray to God to
help me bring this dark soul in the
right way to Him. I had the sure
guide to bliss, that is the Word of
God, and this I read with great care
to him night and morn, and while I
did so, I found peace for us both.
I told him of a part of my life, and
how I had been cast on the isle, and
of our ship; and one day I took him
to the wreck of the ship. He stood for
a long while, as if in deep thought, and
then said: "Me see such boat like
come to place at my tribe;" and now
for the first time I thought that the
white men, from the ship that was
lost, might have gone to his place,
and I said to him: "Were there
white men in the boat?" He said,
with some warmth, "Yes, the boat
full of white mans. We save the
white mans from drown." Said I:
"Where are they now?" He told
me "They live, they dwell at my
tribe." "Well, how did it come that
you did not kill and eat them?" He
said: "We no eats mans but when
they make war fight;" by which he
meant such as come to fight with
them.
One day when we were on the
top of a hill on the east side of the
isle, Friday gave a loud cry—" Oh
joy! Oh glad! There see my land;
there my friends!" "Do you wish
to be back in your own land?" I
said to him. "Yes, I be much O
glad to be at my own tribe."
"What would you do there?" said
I. "Would you turn wild and eat
man's flesh as you did once?"
With a shake of his head, he said:
"No, no! Friday tell them to live
good; tell them to pray God; tell
them eat bread, drink milk; no eat
man more."
"Why, then," said I, "they will
kill you."
With a grave look, he said: "No,
no! they no kill me; they will love to
learn."
I then said to him: "Will you go
back to them?"
He said, with a smile, that he
could not swim so far. I told him I
would make a boat for him.
He said he would go if I would
go with him.
"I go!" says I. "Why, they will
eat me if I go there."
"No, no!" says he; "me make
them no eat you; me make them
much love you." The next day I
took him to see the boat, and when
he got in I saw he was quick, and
could make it go as swift as I could.
He said the boat was too small to
go to his land, and I told him that I
would make him a big boat, and he
could go home to his tribe. He
gave me a deep, sad look, and then
took his axe from his belt and told
me to kill him.
"What must I kill you for?" I
said.
"Why you mad at me? Why
you send Friday off? You go with
Friday."
"What will I do there?"
"You teach them know God, pray
God, live new life; you teach wild
mans be good, like you teach me."
I saw that he was true and meant
all he said, and that I did not need
more proof of his love; so I told
him that he should stay with me,
and that when he went I would go
with him.
This made him glad, and my own
mind was at ease.
From this time my mind was made
up to build a large boat, and to go
with him to see if I could find the
white men he spoke of.
Chapter XII.
Friday and I went to see if we
could find a large tree that we could
cut down and get near to the shore,
so that we could launch our boat
when it was done; for I thought of
the one I had made and could not
use.
We found one that Friday thought
would do. It was a strange kind of
wood to me, but hard and strong-.
We both took a great deal of pains
to make it. The most of it was
hewn in shape with my axe, and when
it was done it took us two weeks to
roll it to the sea. Friday cut down
a tall fir tree, which I made a mast
of, and I put two sails in it, which I
made as well as I could from the old
ones I had left; and a place to stow
my arms and food in. When I was
through I felt quite proud of it. It
was good shape, large, and I had
no doubt but that it would sail
well.
-As it was most time for the great
rains to come on, I thought it best
not to go to sea till they were
through; so we brought the ship
up the creek, out of the way of the
tide of the sea; and to keep her dry,
we put boughs of trees on her, which
made a sort of roof, and I made
Friday dig a small dock for her, so
that she could just float round.
For the next two months we had
to stay in doors most of the time.
I found Friday to be a great help to
me. He would feed my pets, take
care of my flocks, milk goats, cook
my food and spread my meals, and,
best of all, could sit and talk with
me. In this way we spent our days
till the rain was gone, and then we
went to get the ship, to fit her up and
go to sea.
One day I sent Friday to the shore
to see if he could find one of those
large crabs, for the sake of the eggs
(as well as the flesh), which I thought
would be nice to take with us. He
had not been gone long when I
saw him on the run, and heard him
cry: "O sir! O sir! O sad! O
bad!"
When he came up to me I said:
"What is it, Friday?"
"Oh! there one, two, three boats!
one, two, three!"
I thought he meant six boats, but
soon saw there were but three of
them.
Poor Friday shook so hard, and
was so full of fear that they had come
to take him back, and that they would
kill him and eat him up, that it took
me some time to soothe him. I told
him not to mind them; but that he
must do just as I told him to, and
said;
"We can fight them, Friday."
He said: "Yes; me shoot."
''Will you stand by me, Friday,
and do as I bid you?"
He said: "Me die when you bid
me die."
I went and got some rum, and gave
him a good drink of it to cheer him
up, and then I made him take the
two large guns and load them with
large swan shot, while I took two
small guns, a bag of fine shot, and I
stuck my knife in my belt, and hung
my great sword by my side. I took
my glass and went up on the side of
the hill, and from there I saw that
there were three boats, and more than
a score of men, who had just come
on land, and brought with them
three men bound hand and foot,
and that they had come to hold one
of their feasts.
I made up my mind I would put
a stop to this, and would go down
and shoot them all. I told Friday
to come and keep close to me, and
not to shoot till I bid him, and by
no means to speak a word.
As I went down the hill, the
thought came to me: "What right
have I to shed blood, or dip my
hands in the blood of these men, who
have done me no harm?'' To be
sure, Friday might feel they were his
foes, and I could not blame him if he
felt that he must kill them; but had
not God made them as well as me?
and did He not put them here on
earth in their wild state? and had I
a right to go and kill them, or was it
right for me to judge them? So I
thought, I will go down near them
and watch them; and if I find they
will not do me nor my place any
harm, I will act then as God will
guide me.
When I came to the skirt of the
wood, on the side which was next to
them, I told Friday in a low tone to
go to a large tree and look, and bring
me word if he could see what they
were at.
He came back and said that they
had made a fire, and had the three
bound men close by; that one of
them was a white man, and he knew
they meant to kill and eat them; in
fact, he thought that one of them
was dead. When I heard that they
had a white man, it made my head
swim, and I was full of rage; so I
went to a place near by, where I
could see all they did, and found
that they had sent two of their men
to kill the white man, and would
soon cook and eat him up like the
rest.
I knew that I had no time to lose.
I said to Friday: "Do as I bid you,
and just as you see me do. Do not
fail."
He said "Yes," and when I gave
the word "fire," he shot at them the
same time I did.
The men ran in all sorts of ways,
to the right and to the left, with
loud yells and cries of fright, and
went for their boats. At this I
ran out of the wood, with Friday
close to my heels. I gave a loud
shout and bade Friday do the same,
and then Friday and I shot at
them once more. I thought we had
shot them all, for they all fell down
in a heap in the boat; but in a short
time two of them got up and came
on shore, when Friday made a rush
at them, at which they took to their
heels, and were soon with all the
rest far out to sea.
While Friday went to fight them,
I went up to the poor white man,
and cut with my knife the bands that
bound him, and told him to get up;
but he was too weak to speak or
stand. I took out my flask and gave
him a drink, and a cake of corn
bread to eat, which gave him some
strength, and he sat up and made
signs to show me that he must in.
some way thank me for what I had
done. I told him not to mind that
now, but to try and get up, and I
would take him home with me.
While I was with this man Friday
went to look at a poor wretch, who
lay bound in a boat the men had left
in their fright to get off He cut the
bands that bound him, at which he
gave a groan, for he thought Friday
was one of the men who had come
to kill him. When I heard him
groan I left the white man (who by
this time could sit up and talk), and
went to see what I could do for the
poor black man. I gave him a large
dram of rum, which, when he had
drank it, made him come to, and he
sat up in the boat and spoke to
me.
When Friday heard him speak
and saw his face, he took him in his
arms and gave him a hug and a kiss;
and then he wrung his hands and
beat his own face and head like a
mad man. It made me shed tears
to see him laugh, and sing and
dance round him. I said to him:
"What ails you? Who is it?" For
a long while he did not speak, and
then told me that he was this man's
son.
Now that these poor men were
free, and it was quite late in the
day, I thought we must get them to
our tent. They were so stiff and
sore that they could not move,
so I gave Friday some rum to
rub their arms and hands and feet
with.
I said to Friday: "Did you give
this man some bread?"
He said: "None, bad dog, eat all
up self."
I gave him some cakes of bread
I had with me, and I saw Friday
run off as swift as a deer, and I
could not think where he had gone;
but in a short time he came back
with a jug, that he had gone way back
to our farm for, that he might give the
poor old man a fresh drink from our
spring. We all took a drink, and
the men by this time were quite at
ease; but as they could not walk,
Friday and I made a sort of hand
chair, and took them to my place.
But when we came there we found
that we could not get them in my
tent, for they could not climb my
steps; and as they must have a good
place to rest in for the night, Friday
and I made a small tent with some
poles, and put old sails on the top,
and then made two nice beds of rice
straw for them to he on.
I sent Friday down for our arms,
and all the things that we had left
on the shore, and in the mean time
I cut up a young kid and went to
work to boil or stew some of it; and
I made them both a good dish of
broth, with some rice in it.
Chapter XIII.
Friday soon came back with the
things I had sent him for, and we
had our meal; and then I told him
to put the men to bed, and stay with
them for the night, for they might
want him. He did so, and I sat for
a long time in the door of my tent
to think. I felt quite like a king.
Was I not lord of all here? and here
are all my men, three whom I think
would serve me, and if need be lay
down their lives for me.
The next morn I had a good long
talk with the men, and the white
man, who I shall call Frank, told
me that he had come from Spain, and
that he, with some more men, had
been in the ship that was lost, and
they went in the small boat to the
main land, where they found naught
but wild men; and as they could not
get off from them, they had made
them (the white men) their slaves,
and when they were in want of a
feast, they would come on the isle and
bring a man or two with them, and
cut them up; and they had brought
him with two of their own kind to
do the same to them.
The old man had such a queer
name that I thought I would call
him Jack. I thought we had best
be on the watch for the wild men,
for fear that they would come back
with some more of their own men,
and try to kill us; but Jack thought
we would see them no more, for they
had had such a fright at the noise
and fire of our arms, that they would
think we were some kind of sprites
that had come down from the sky
to kill them.
I found Jack could talk quite
well, as the white men had been
with him for some time, and as they
were all kept as slaves, had made
friends of them.
Frank said, that he thought if we
went to the place where they had
come from, the rest of the white men
that were there would be glad to
come back with me and serve me.
They had not had a chance to get
off, for they had no arms or tools to
work with, and I thought we ought
to go right off for them; but Frank
said, "Wait, my friend, you have
now two more to feed, and it will not
be right to bring more men here, till
you have more to feed them with,
else we may all starve.
So I went to work first to make
my tent and caves more safe, and
then Frank and I with the two black
men did naught for a year and a
half but work on my farm, and when
I felt that I had what would keep us
all, or that we could raise it, I sent
Frank and Jack out on a boat, to
see if they could find them and bring
them back to me.
They had been gone eight days,
when one morn, Friday came in the
tent to me and said, " O ! sir, they
are come, they are come!" and I
thought our men had come, and ran
out with all the speed I could to
meet them, but I soon found that it
was a strange ship, and not on my
side of the isle.
I thought I had best watch them
for a while; so I stood still, and I
saw them put out a long boat, and
put three men that were bound in
it, and then five men got in and they
all came to the shore.
Friday said, "O ! sir, you see
white mens eat men, as well as wild
men."
"Why," said I, "do you think they
will eat them all?"
"Oh ! yes, they will eat them."
"No, No, Friday, I think they
will kill them, but you may be sure
they will not eat them."
When they had all got up on the
land, I saw one of the men raise his
sword to strike one of the bound
men, who hung his head, as if he
would let him do what he would, and
then he did the same to the rest, and
then set them free.
The five men then went to the
boat, but the tide was so low, they
could not get her off the sand; so
they sat down near by, to wait for
the tide to come in, and the three
men who had been bound, went off
a short way and laid down in the
shade of a tree.
I now went to my tent, took all
the arms I thought Friday and I
could use, and went back to the men
on the ground, and said to them,
"Sirs, why are you here, and who
are you?"
When they heard my voice, they
all gave a start, and I thought they
would all flee in the woods.
I said "Do not fear; I am a friend
who has come to help you."
"Did you drop down from the
sky, and are you man or God?" said
one of them with a grave look.
"A God would not be apt to come
in these clothes," said I, "but all help
is from the Lord. Tell me your case,
and I will see if I can give you aid.
You see that my man and I have
arms, and we will do what we can to
serve you."
One man spoke, and said: "Our
case is too long a one to tell you,
while our foes are so near. My name
is John Smith; we have come from
Hull, and that is my ship out there,
and we were bound to the South
Sea isles, and on the way out, some
of my crew grew rough and rude,
and said they would not mind me,
and put me in chains; and now they
have thrust me, (with my mate and
this man), out here to die. They
mean to go back to the ship, and
make the rest go with them where
they please."
"Have they fire arms?" I said.
"They had two guns, which they
have left in the boat."
"Well, then," said I, "leave the
rest to me. I see that they are all
to sleep now. It will not be a
hard task to kill them all. Shall I
do it?"
He thought for a while, and then
said if we could get rid of two of
them, who were the worst of the lot,
that the rest would give up to him,
and go back to the ship and do what
was right.
I said: " If I do this and help you
to get your ship back, what will you
do for me?"
He said: "If y^'* save my life
and help me to get i«.y ship, you
shall have my ship, and you may go
where you please, or I will take you
right back to your own land. If we
do not get the ship I will stay here
and work for you, and do just as you
say in all things."
I saw that I could trust him, and
I gave each of them a gun, and we
went up near to the men.
One of our men made a slight
noise, which woke up two of them,
and they spoke to the rest, at which
they made a spring for us. I told
our men to fire. They did so, and
we shot two of them. There were
now three of them left, and one of
these had a slight wound, and they
ran for the boat; but Friday had
gone down to it, and brought up the
oars and sails and the guns, and now,
of course, they could not get off. They
were in a great rage, and for a time
did not know what to do; but at last
they made up their minds to yield to
us, and we bound them hand and
foot, and took them up to my place.
The men who were bound I put in
a safe place, and the rest of us went
to my tent, where we had a good
meal, and then sat down to talk and
rest.
I told the men of my life on the
isle, how long I had been here, and
what I had done; and when John
Smith had heard it all, he was like one
struck dumb, and he sat in deep
thought for quite a long time, and
then he said he could not help think
how strange it was that I had been
cast here on this lone isle, and that
while I had been kept here so long,
and could not tell why, how through
me the lives of all the men here were
safe, and that we ought all to bless
God, who had shown so much love
to us, and that this should teach us
at all times to trust Him.
CHAPTER XIV.
We knew that the rest of the crew
would soon come to find the first
ones, and that we must in some way
get the best of them. I thought
the best thing to do was to bring
the boat up close on shore, take out
what things there were left in her,
and stave her in, and then wait to
see how we could get the ship.
We all went down and broke a
large hole in the boat, and drew it
up quite high on the sand, and what
few things there were in it I gave
to Friday to take to our tent. While
we were at work we heard a gun
fire. It came from the ship, and
was a sign for the men to come
back; but when the men on the
ship found the boat did not move,
they let down a small boat, and ten
men got in it and came to the shore.
When we saw them get in the boat,
we went up and hid back of some
trees till they came on the land.
John S. said that three of these men
were as bad as the two we had shot,
and if we could shoot them we had
naught to fear from the rest, and
there was but one more bad one left
on the ship. He was the head one;
but when he saw that he had no one
to help him, he would have to give
in; and he thought it would not do
to kill these men, for we would need
them on the ship.
When the men came up to where
the boat lay, and saw that there was
no one in it, three of them went up
and down the shore, and sent up
loud yells to make their friends hear;
but as this did not seem to do, they
all but one (whom they left to watch
the boat) came on shore, and went
off to the south side of the isle, and
had a long talk. They came back in
a short time, and we thought they
would all go off to the ship, and we
would lose them and the ship; so
I sent Friday and the mate down
a short way and told them to call,
which they did, and the men ran
up and down, to hear where the
noise came from. I told Friday
and the mate to creep close to the
ground in one way, and John S. and
I went round on the side near the
creek. In this way we could see,
and then, when I gave the word,
we could all fire at once.
In a short time three of the men
came close up to us, and at a sign
from me Friday and the mate shot
at them. One fell dead, the next
was hurt, and the third cried out,
"Who are you?" The mate said:
"I am the mate, and you must yield,
or you are all dead men."
He said: "To whom must we
yield?"
"To John S. He is here with
the King and five score men, and
if you do not yield you are all lost."
The rest of the men had-come
up, and as it was so near dark,
they could not see us; and when
they heard the mate say this they
laid down their arms, and in a
short time they were bound hand
and foot, and Friday and Jack took
them to the cave, where Friday kept
watch all night.
The next morn John S. went to
them, and he told them that he had
come from the King, and it was his
will that they should all stay there
till they could make up their minds
to give up and do what was right,
and go back to the ship, and do just
as he bid them. All but two of
them said they would be glad to do
all this. He told them he would go
and tell the King.
We thought it best to keep them
there for a few days, and gave Friday
charge of them, and he took them
food and drink three times a day.
John S. and the mate went to the
ship in the small boat the men came
in; and when they got to the ship
there were but . three men on the
deck, and one of them was the man
who had been the head of the gang.
John S. and the mate soon put him
out of the way, and the rest of the
men were glad to be free, for they
did not wish to harm John S., but
fear of the bad men had made them
act as they did. They said they
would work for him, and help him
to take the ship home. They then
went down in the ship, and when
they had put things to rights in her,
they brought her up to the isle.
When she came up to the shore I
was up on the top of the hilt, and
John S. came up to me and said:
"My dear friend, there is your ship,
for she is all yours, we are yours,
and all that is in her is yours."
This was too much for me, and
I was like one that was dumb,
and I sank faint to the ground.
John S. took me by the hand to lift
me up, and gave me a drink of wine
that he had in a flask he had brought
from the ship; and though this gave
me some strength, still I could not
speak for a long time. I shed tears
.of joy. There was the ship, her
sails set, and her flags thrown out to
the wind, and I could now go home.
I gave my friend a hug and told him
I would go with him, for I felt that
he had been sent to me from God.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141
ship, and John S. gave me a whole
suit of clothes, which I put on. I
felt strange, and could scarce get
round in them. I thought of poor
Friday the first time he had his
clothes on. John S. thought we
ought to go right off, but I told him
we ought to see to the men that
were bound in the cave. We did
not like to trust them to go back
with us, and as they had not seen
me, I went to them and told them
I had come from the King, and he
had said that I might set them free
if they would swear they would stay
on the isle and work the land, for if
they went back with us they would
all be hung for what they had done
on the ship. I set them all free, and
told them how they might live, and
how I had done, and I gave them,
in charge of Frank and Jack, and I
told Frank I would send him some
men from his own land as soon
as I could.
I took Friday, one of my polls,
my goat skin cap and coat, with all
the gold I had laid by so long, and
went on board the ship; and the
next day, when I had bid all good
bye, we set sail for home.
Home! what a sweet word. I
had been on the isle a score and
eight years, and to whose love and
care did I owe all, my life and health,
these friends, with the way and
means to get home to my own land?
It was on this isle that I had been
brought to know God, and. my heart
rose in praise to Him, and I knelt
down to thank Him for all He had
done for me.
Chapter XV.
We had fair winds and a good
time most of the way to Hull, for it
was from here that John S. had
brought the ship, and he thought he
ought to take it back to the same
place; and I was glad to come
here, for it was near my old home,
and I had now as great a wish to get
back there, as I had to leave it when
I was a boy.
When I went to my old home in
York, what a change I found there!
It is true, there was the stream,
and the house stood there still,
and the farm was the same, but my
dear friends were all gone, and the
stones at the head of their graves
in the yard back of the old church
were all that was left to tell me the
sad news of when and where they
were gone. They had thought me
dead for years, so they left all their
wealth to some friends who were
near of kin.
As I did not care to claim it, and
had no cause to stav here, I thought
I would go down and see the men I
had left my farm with, and see what
they had done.
And now I had a piece of good
luck which I did not look for. John
Smith told the men whose ship he
had, what I had done to save his
life, and how I took care of him on
the isle; and they made up a large
purse of gold and gave it to me; and
this, with the gold I had brought
from the isle, made quite a large
sum.
I set sail for the south as soon as
I found a ship that went that way.
When I got to my farm I found that
Wells, the man who had bought the
farm with .me, was dead, and the rest
of the men whom I left in charge,
had made up their minds that I too
was dead, for they had not heard
from me; and as they did not wish
to stay there, they had sold my farm
and gave one third the price to the
King, and two thirds to some good
men near by, whose work it was to
teach the dark souls that were all
round, to love and pray to God.
I then went to hunt up the man
who took me to sea the fiust time.
I found him grown to be quite old,
and at first he did not know me; I
told him of my first trip to sea, and
this brought me to his mind.
He was quite glad to see me, and
told me how and where he had been
since he left me. He said his son
had charge of a ship, and- was not at
home, but that he would do all he
could to help me. He thought I
ought to stay in my own land, and
take my gold and buy a farm. He
said, he thought I could get a good
price for a piece. of land that I had
near my old farm, and he wrote to
a friend of his to sell it for me, which
he did, and I was paid such a large
sum for it, that with all the rest I
had I was quite rich. So, I thought
I wouM seek a place to live in, but
my old wish to roam came on, so I
thought I would see some more of
the world, and I went to France,
and from there to Spain. Of course,
Friday went all round with me, and
the poor man did not know what to
make of all the new and strange
things he saw. He did not know
why it should be so cold on the top
of the high hills, nor where the snow
came from.
One day we met four men, and
they said they would like to join us
and go round with us, so we took a
guide, and for four weeks they were
with us.
We came to a wild spot one day,
and Friday had a great deal of fun
with some bears that we found there.
He made us all laugh to see him
climb up a tree and shake hands
with an old bear that was on a large
limb. We shot some of the bears
and took their skins with us. Friday
was full of life and fun, and did all
he could to make it bright for us,
and was of great use to us at all
times. The men were quite fond of
him, and when they left us they
made him a nice gift.
When I had gone round for some
months, I went back to the land of
my birth, and there I met a fine
young girl whom I made my wife.
I bought a large farm with a good
house on it, and for some years
dwelt there in rest and peace. I
was rich, and had no need to work
hard. In time I had two sons, and
I found" my spare hours could be
well spent with them. I taught
them to work on the farm, and I felt
the truth of some lines I had once
read:
"Free from vice, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But right in the midst of all this
joy, there came a great blow to me,
and this was the death of my good
wife.
It is not my place here to say too
much in praise of her. She was full
of love for me, and had a kind heart
for all; she had a sound mind, and
was to me like a bright star to lead
me in the right way.
Her loss was so great to me, and
my home was now so sad, that I
could not stay there in peace; each
turn I made brought my wife to my
mind.
In a few months from the time I
lost my wife, the son of a near friend
of mine came to me, and told me he
would like to go to sea if I would go
with him. I had a great wish to go
back to the lone isle where I had
been so long. I told him if he
would take me there I would be
glad to go to sea with him. This he
said he would do, and went off to get
a ship and crew.
While he was gone, I sold my
farm and made my will. I gave to
each of my sons a share of my wealth,
and put them in the care of the wife
of my old friend, who had been so
good to me when I was a young
man.
One bright day in the first of the
year 1693, Friday and I set sail
with my young friend for our old
home on the isle.
When we had been out for some
weeks, one dark night one of the
men came to me, and said he saw a
great light a long way off. I took
up my glass, but could see no signs of
land, and thought it must be a ship
in flames; so I told my friend who
had the ship in charge, that we must
try to get up close to it, and in a half
hour we could see that it was a large
ship on fire. We told the men to
hang out lights all round on our
ship, and to .fire off five guns, for a
sign to them that we saw them and
would come and help them.
By da ylight the next morn, three
large boats came up to us, full of those
that had been on board of the ship.
They said the fire broke out down
in the hold of the ship, from some
sparks of fire from some of the
pipes, which the men had to
smoke.
It was a French ship, and the poor
folks were all in a wild state. They
had thought there was no hope for
them, and when they saw our ship
and felt that they were safe, and would
not have to go down in the sea, they
sent up shouts of joy, and wrung
their hands, and some would sing
and some would dance, while some
could do naught but sit still and
look at us. There was a young
priest on board, and he went round
to soothe them, and when all were
calm, he made them all kneel down
and thank God.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
In a few days we met a ship that
was on her way to France, and we
put most of the poor folks on board,
to go back to their own homes. The
young priest, with a young man and
a young girl, said they would like
to go to the isle with me.
In four months from the time we
left my home, we came in sight of the
isle. I said to Friday, "Do you
know where you are?"
He said with a smile and a clap
of his hands, " Oh, yes, oh there!"
"Well, Friday, do you think we
shall find the folks we left, and do
you think we shall see poor old
Jack?"
He stood mute for some time, and
then said, with tears in his eyes,
"No, no, no see him more."
"Why so?" said I, "how do you
know that?"
"Oh no," says Friday, " he long
dead; he much old man."
"Well, Friday," said I, "we shall
»
see.
When .we came near to the shore,
I told the mate to fire off three guns,
and hang out a white flag of truce,
so as to let those that were on the
land know that we were friends; and
then I let down a small boat, and
took the priest and Friday with some
men, and we went up the creek. which
was near my old place. I told the
men they must not go on shore till I
gave the word; but Friday caught
sight of poor old Jack, and I could
not keep him in the boat. He ran
up to him, and felt of him, and put
both of his arms round him, and gave
him a hug and a kiss, and then took
him by the hand and made him sit
down on the ground, so that he could
talk to him.
For a week he kept this up. He
would fetch Jack some good thing
to eat, and lead him up and down,
like a girl, and would tell him all he
had heard and seen since he had
left him. I thought if all sons would
act in this way, there would be no
need for God's fifth law.
CHAPTER XVI.
While Friday was with Jack, I
went on shore; I saw my friend
Frank on the top of the hill. He
did not know me; I went up to him
and took off my hat, and said, "Sir,
do you not know ' me?" He gave
his gun to a man who stood near,
and came up to me, and threw his
arms round me, and gave me a hug.
He said he was glad to see me; that
he had thought a good deal of me,
but as he had not heard from me
for so long a time, he had made up
his mind that he should see me no
more. He then made a sign to
the man who had his gun, and
bade him go and call the men,
and told me to come up to my old
place.
I sent the men in the boat back
to the ship, and took the priest and
we went to my farm; but I did not
know it, the trees had grown up
so thick round it, that it was like a
dense woods, and they had built
forts all round. I said, "What are
these forts for?"
Frank said, when he had told me
all that he had gone through since I
left him, I would see that he had
great need of them.
The man to whom he spoke when
I first met him, now came back, with
ten men, and Frank said, "There
are some of the men who owe their
lives to you." In the dress they
wore, it was hard work for me to
guess who they were, but Frank soon
made it clear to both them and me,
and they came up to greet me, one
by one, not like plain men, but like
men of rank would come to a King.
We now went to my tent. Frank
had built it out, and it was large and
full of things Frank had made, such
as chairs, stands, shelves, and two
good beds. When we sat down
Frank said he would tell me what
hard work he had with some of the
men.
But first, I must tell you that
when I left the isle, in the ship with
John S., three of the men got off,
and went back to the isle to seek
those that were left there. You know
that two of those on the isle were the
worst ones in the crew; and now
these two went with those who came
back, and it was with these five bad
men Frank had such a hard time.
The rest were all right; they went to
work to build huts and raise grain,
and would mind Frank in all things.
The rogues thought that these
good men should keep them and
work for them, for they did not like
to work. and they did not want to
live right, so the good men would
not help them. This put the rogues
in a rage, and they swore they would
fix them; but the good men took this
as a jest. One of the rogues said,
"they will see if it is a jest;" and one
day when some of the good men
were off, one of the rogues took up
a large stick that was on fire, and
put it to the side of one of the huts,
and would have set it on fire, but
one of the men thrust it one side, or
else this hut with all the rest would
have been burnt up. This led to
a great fight, and the good men
drove the rogues off to the north end
of the isle, near where the wild men
came for their feasts, and here they
dug a sort of cave in a piece of
woods to sleep in at night, but would
be up to all sorts of bad deeds in the
day time.
They would steal the corn, and
pull up the stalks, run off with the
goats, and do all that they could to
vex and tease the good men. One
day three of the good men went
down on the shore, and the rogues
came at them and there was a great
fight, which, when the rest of the
XI
good men heard, they came down to
help their friends, and they took the
rogues to Frank; he took their arms
from them, and said, "Why do you
act in this way?" They said they
could not live where they were.
Frank told them if they would do
no more harm, but be still and try to
work, the good men would try to help
them and they could live in peace,
but they could not have their arms.
For a while all went on in peace;
the rogues would do some work, but
this did not last long; they grew
bold, and were soon at their old
tricks once more. Frank thought he
would have to put them in a boat
and send them off; but a strange
thing took place one night, which
made them tame for a long time.
Frank had gone to bed in the tent,
but he could not sleep; his mind was
ill at ease; he said he felt as if there
was a great weight on his mind, and
thought he should hear some bad
news. He thought that there might
be a plot with the rogues to kill the
good men; so he woke up the man
who was with him, and told him. how
he felt, and he said, "Say you so? I
think we should go out, and look
round." This man went up to the
top of the hill, and came back with
the word, that there was a great light
not far off, and he heard men shout
and yell as if there was a great fight.
Frank then went and told the
men, and they all went up the hill
to watch. There were three sets
of wild men, and they were all in
a fierce fight. The men thought
they would like to go down, but
Frank said they must stay there,
and he sent Jack down, to spy out
why they came. He took off his
clothes so as to be like one of them,
and then went right down. He had
been gone an hour, when he came
back and said that there were two
tribes, and that they were in a fierce
fight, and would stay there till the
light of day.
Jack could scarce keep the men
back. He told them there were
scores of the wild men, and that they
could do no good, but to let them
fight it out; it would be the best way
to get rid of them.
They fought for three hours, and-
by this time it was quite light, and
then they got in the boats and went
off. The men went down to view
the place, and they found more than
a score of dead men, and three who
were hurt, and these they took care
of and kept them to work for them.
When the rogues saw what work
the wild men had made, and the burnt
bones that lay strewn all round, it
made them sick, and for some time
they were quite mild, and would do
just as Frank bid them, as well as
their share of the work.
One day one of the rogues got mad
at one of the slaves, and took up his
axe to kill him, when one of the good
men went up to him, and told him
to stop, which made the rogue mad,
and he would have made short work
of him, but some of the rest of the
good men came up to help him, and
then the rogues came to join their
friend, and there was quite a fight,
which Frank had to stop.
Frank now saw that it was of no
use to try and keep the bad men
with the good ones, and that it would
be best for them to go some where
else, and so he gave some corn, rice,
grain, and clothes, with some tools
to work with (for he said it would
not be right to let them starve), and
sent them off to one end of the
isle. He told them if they came
near his men, to hurt them, to
steal their flocks, or to spoil or
burn their goods, he would put
them to death.
They went to the N. E. end of
the isle, and put up two tents, and
set out some young trees, like those
that were round my large tent, and
for six months all went well with
them; but this could not last; they
would not work, and one day they
took a whim to go to the place where
the wild men came from, and see if
they could not seize some, and bring
them back to the isle and make
slaves of them. They came to
Frank and his men, and told them
they would like a boat and some
food and clothes to take with them.
Frank's men were so glad to get
rid of them, that they gave them all
these things, and some firearms too,
for they told them the wild men
would try to kill them, and they
must have some arms to keep them
off. They bid them God speed,
and thought they should see no
more of them.
Chapter XVII.
But, in three weeks, they came
back. They said they went first to
the main land, but the men that
were there would not let them come
on shore; so they went on, till they
came to an isle which lay to the
west of the main land. Here they
met with a kind race of men, who
said, "they did not eat men, nor
fight if they could help it." They
went on shore, and gave the chief
man some of the things they had,
and he made his men bring them
food, fish and fruit, and when they
came off, they brought down five
girls and six men to take back as
slaves.
They did not know what to do
with them all, but saw that they
must take them, or the chief might
get mad, and then he would hurt
them; so they gave the chief an
axe, an old key and a knife, and
he put them in their boat.
When Frank and his men heard
this, they went down to see the
slaves, and found them all bound
in one of the huts. The poor things
were full of fear when they saw the
men, for they thought they had
come down to look at them, that
they might pick out the best ones to
kill; so Frank sent old Jack to tell
them that they would not hurt them.
As Frank and his friends did not
want the girls with them, the rogues
said they would like to wed them;
so they drew lots for them and each
took a wife. This was a good thing
for them all. The girls were true,
smart and clean, and as the men now
had some one to care for, they built
huts and laid out farms, and in this
way soon made their part of the isle
look like a small town.
The black men said they would
work for the men, but as there was not
much for them to do, and they did
not watch them, one day one of them
ran off to the woods. They thought
he was dead, but in a few weeks, when
they saw six boats full of black men
come on shore, and go right to the
place where the men were, they
knew that he had gone home, and
told his friends how and where to
find them.
The wild men went right to the
woods, and when the white ones went
to catch them, they found they hadset
on fire some of their huts, and they
were all in flames. This made them
rage, and they laid a plan to shoot
them as they came out of the woods.
So two of the white men got up in
the trunk of a large tree that stood
on the edge of the wood, and when
they saw them, they took aim at
them through a hole in the tree,
and as they came out, in this way
they shot near half a score of them.
The rest now all ran out of the woods,
and Frank and his men, who had
come up to help the white men, shot
full two score more. They then
bound most of the rest, and put
them in their boats, and sent them
back to their own land.
There were a few who had a wish
to stay with the white men and be
their slaves, so they kept them. The
men now went to look for their wives.
They found them safe, but near all
their huts were burnt down. They
soon built these up, with the help of
Frank's men.
For six months they saw no more
of the wild men.
But one day, just at dusk, some of
the men saw a score of small boats
come up on the east side of the isle,
full of men, who had darts, bows,
clubs and swords. They were a
fierce set, and our men were full of
fears, but they knew they could not
do much that night. They thought
they would make things as safe as
they could. So they drove their
goats and flocks to the old cave, took
up most all their huts or tents, and
sent their wives to my big tent, all
but two, who would not go; they
said they could fight with bows,
which they did, and were a great
help to the men. » \
Frank now took the men, and gave
part of them to one of the rogues
whose name was Will, and he took
the rest in his charge. Will, though
he had been a bad man, was bold,
and just the one to head the men.
They took all the arms they had, and
went up as near the wild men as they
could, and hid till the next morn.
When the sun was up quite high
the wild men came in crowds to
where our men were, when at a sign
from Frank, they shot at them right
and left. The foe were so close, that
they fell dead all round, and those
that the men did not kill were hurt,
and this put them in a great fright;
they flew to the woods as swift as
they could, and here they set up
loud cries and shouts. Frank told
his men to let them be, for they would
soon be so sore and stiff from their
wounds, that it would not be a hard
task to get the best of them; so the
men went down to the shore where
the boats lay, and" they took some
dry wood from a dead tree and set
most of their boats on fire.
When the wild men saw this they
were so mad that they ran up and
down the isle, and trod down the corn
and tore up their vines and plants.
A great storm came up that night,
and as the boats were most all gone
the wild men could not get off. Our
men had to watch them all that night;
and at the break of the next day,
they found that a score of them were
dead in the woods, and the rest were
sick and hurt; so they sent old Jack
to those that were left, and he told
them that if they would give up to
the white men they would save their
lives, and be kind to them, and
that they should live on a part of
the isle, but that they must not come
near the white men, but keep in
their own bounds. This they were
glad to do, and Frank gave them a
place way off on the south east end of
the isle, and he gave them corn to
plant, and they soon learnt to make
all kinds of things with wood and
corn, such as chairs, and stands, and
beds.
They were now down on the end
of the isle where Frank had put them,
and the white men did not see them
for weeks at a time. And from that
time, till I came to the isle, they had
not seen or heard of a wild man.
You must not think that Frank
told me all this at once, as I have
told it to you. When we went out
to walk, he would show me the
tents, and all that had been done and
built on the isle, and in this way I
found out what I have told you. I
now saw why Frank had built the
forts I spoke of, to keep him and his
friends safe from the bad white men,
and the wild men.
Chapter XVIII.
I had some long talks with Will
and the rest of the rogues. They said
they knew they had done wrong, but
that now they had wives and good
homes, if I would help them they
would try and do right. I told them
I would do all I could for them.
One day I told all the men on
the isle that they must come and
dine with me. I got the ship's cook
and his mate to come on shore to
dress my meal. We brought on
shore six rounds of beef with four
of pork, a punch bowl full of beer,
and ten flasks of French wine.
Frank gave us five whole kids to
roast; we sent some of the fresh
meat in a close dish, to the men on
the ship, as they had not had fresh
meat for a long while. We had a
gay time at this feast, and when we
were through, I took Will and his
men down on board of the ship, and
gave them some thin, loose, light
coats, some shirts, and socks, and
shoes, and some tools to work with,
such as hoes, rakes, spades and
knives, as well as some arms. For
these the}'gave me great thanks, and
said that as I had done so much for
them, they should bear in mind all I
had said to them, and that they
would stay on the isle as long as I
bid them, and try at all times to do
their best, and would live in peace
with all the men on the isle.
The young priest, who had gone
all round the isle with me and knew
all Frank had told me, said to me
one day, that he would like to stay
on the isle, and he thought the
young men and the young girl who
were on the ship would like to do
the same, as they could do a great
deal of good to these poor men and
their wives. He thought that he
ought to preach the word of God to
them, for the most of them would,
no doubt, have to end their days
here.
I was glad to hear him say this,
and told him I thought it was a good
plan. I went to the ship and
brought the young folks on shore,
and with them a young man, that
we gave the name of Jack-of-all-
trades to, as he could do all sorts of
things, and was of so much use to
us on the ship. I found in my room
five or six books of God's Word, and
all but one of these I gave to the
priest, and that one I gave to Will,
and told him I would like him to
read it night and morn, which he
said he would do.
One day the young man came to
me and said with a shy look, that as
we had a priest, there were two
young folks that would like to wed.
I thought it was the maid and this
young man; so I told him to think
well of it, for the maid had not been
brought up as he had, and was not
of the same rank with him, and that
at some time he might feel bad, and
wish to get rid of her; but he said
,with a smile, he was not the man, it
was the maid and Jack-of-all-trades.
I told him I was glad of this, for I
thought Jack was a smart, true man,
and the maid a good girl, and she
could do a great deal to help and
teach the rest of the poor girls on
the isle.
The priest said he had one thing
to ask of me, and that was, that he
might keep Friday with him, as he
could do so much to help him learn
the speech of the black men that
were there, and could teach them to
know and pray to God as he did.
I told the priest that I felt what
he said was true, but that Friday had
been so long with me, and was so
true to me, that I could not part with
him; and I told him once he should
not leave me, and that if I did not
take him with me now, he would
think I was false to him, and he
would die of grief.
I had now been here for a month,
and as all the men were at peace, I
thought I would go back to the ship
and sail round and see some more of
the world.
My mind was in such a state, in
fact had been so all my life, that I
could not rest long in a place. So
true it is that what is "born in the
bones can not be beat out of the
flesh." I sent for the men to come
and talk with me once more, and
gave them each a piece of land, and
quite a large farm to Jack-of-all-
trades, and I told them they must
try and live in peace and learn to
love the Lord, and do all they could
that was right, and when I got home
I would send them some stock, such
as cows, pigs, and sheep, as well as
some goods for clothes. I then bid
them all good bye, and set sail.
It was the sixth of May, a clear
bright day, we shot off five guns and
the men on the shore did the same,
and we were soon out of sight.
When we had been out to sea
three days, the mate came to me and
said, "Sir, do you see that fleet?" I
took out my glass, and saw that
there were scores of small boats full
of wild men. The men in the ship
were full of fear, and I must say that
I felt there were so few of us,
that they might do us a great deal
of harm, but I told the men to take
their arms and to fix them, then to
get out the small boats and man
them, and to furl all the sails, and we
would lay by and wait for them to
come, and we could fire on them. I
thought they might try to fire our
ship, so I told the men not to let
them come too near.
They came quite fast, and in a
short time were quite close to us. I
told Friday to go on deck and call to
them, and ask them what they meant.
He did so, but as soon as they
heard him speak, they took aim at
him. Friday said with a loud voice
"They will shoot," and just then they
sent out full three score darts; three
of them struck poor Friday, and he
fell dead.
When I saw poor Friday fall, I
was so mad and full of rage, that I
told my men to load four guns with
large shot and five with small, and
to give them such a blast of fire as
they had not seen or heard in their
lives. I can not tell how they were
hurt; we knew that we had shot
some of them, for we saw them sink,
and most of their boats were split or
sunk; but they did not seem to mind
this, for they were in such a great
fright and haste to get off, that those
who could swim did so, and the rest
took the good boats and went off as
fast as they could, and in less than
three hours we could not see a sign
of them.
There was one poor man who
could not swim, so our men took him
on the ship. He was hurt and could
not speak for some time, and for a
long while he did not want to eat;
but we taught him a few words of
our own tongue, and then he told us,
that the day we saw the wild men,
there were five tribes, and they were
out with their kings to have a great
fight, and that when his king saw
our ship, he said they must come up
to it and fight there, so as to let us
see them, for they thought it would
be a grand sight, but the noise and
fire from our guns were so great,
that it gave them such a fright, they
were glad to get out of our way as
quick as they could.
Poor Friday! I must now take my
last leave of him. My heart was
sad and full of grief when I thought
of his love, how true and kind he
had been, and now he was gone, and
how I should miss him.
Chapter XIX.
I had a box made, and we put
him in it, and let him down in the
sea, and the men shot off ten guns
as he went down.
We now went on our way. We
had fair winds and a smooth sea,
and in two weeks we came to All
Saints Bay. Here I had a sloop
made, on which I put a crew of eight
men with their wives. I bought a
large stock of goods and tools, and
these, with three cows, five calves, a
score of hogs, two sheep, a horse and
two mares, I put on board the sloop,
and sent them all to my friends on
the isle, as I had told them I would
do when I left them. I told the
mate how to go there, and I heard
that the sloop and all on board went
there safe and sound, and the things
were such a great help to them, that
in a few years I would not have
known the old isle.
And now I shall take leave of my
isle. I had done all I could for those
that were there, and if they did not
want to stay they could go where
they had a wish to, for they had the
sloop and some small boats, as well
as the large boat Friday and I had
made; but as I have said, I heard
that all went well with them, and I
thank God, that I have had the
chance to do some good in my life.
We went from All Saints Bay to
the Cape of Good Hope. We did
not stay here long. There did not
seem to be much to be done or seen
here; so we laid in a stock of
some things we were in need of, and
went to a large isle, which lies north
east of the Cape. We put our ship
in port on the east side of the isle,
and I, with some of the men, got
in a small boat and went on shore.
We saw that the folks who dwelt here
were kind, and we thought we could
do well here.
The men came down to look at
us, and when we saw them, we cut
three boughs from a tree, and stuck
each of them at just such a space,
and they did the same, for this was
a mark with them of a sort of truce,
and that we could trade with them,
but we must not pass their poles or
sticks, nor take our arms with us,
and they must do the same, and we
must all buy and sell by these sticks.
They brought us milk, roots, fish
and meat, and were glad to take
knives and such small things as we
had to give them.
The first night we were here, some
of the men thought they would stay
on shore all night; so they made a
small hut to sleep in, and I went
with a man and a boy in the boat.
At two o'clock the next morn I
heard one of the men on shore call
for help, and then I heard a gun. I
woke up the man who was with me
(and told the boy to watch the boat),
and we took all the arms we had
with us and went on shore to help
them.
There were but nine of us and
there were scores of the foe; they
sent their darts at us, and we shot
off our guns; we knew that we had
hurt some of them from the cries we
heard, but it was too dark for us to
see well. Our men came in the
boat, and we put up boards and
chests and stood back of them, and
then we made signs to the ship to
come to us, and the man in charge
brought her up, and we all kept
watch till it was light, when the men
from the ship came on shore and we
sent them such fierce fire, from our
large and small guns, that they fled
to the woods in a short time.
We found the cause of the fight to
be the fault of one of our men; he
had said some rude things to one of
the girls who came to bring them
milk, which she did not like, and she
told some of her friends, and they
all came down to beat him for it.
This man's name was Tom; he was
not to be found with our men, and
though we kept on the look out for
him for two days, he did not come,
and we made up our mind that he
was dead.
Some of the men said they would
go and look for him, but this I did
not want them to do. I told them
they might share the fate that Tom
had, but they would not heed, and
eight of them went off, while the rest
went on the ship, and I took two
men and a boy and went to the boat.
When our men went off they did
not mean to harm their foes, but see
if they could find Tom, and at the
same time look for gold. They
went on for a mile and saw no one,
and thought they must have gone
the wrong way, when they saw a
cow by a tree, and then they knew
that some one must live near, and in
a short time, they came to a small
town, and the first sight here that
met their eyes was poor Tom. They
had hung him to a tree by one arm,
and then cut his throat.
This made them so mad, that they
swore they would kill all their foes
and fire the town. The huts were all
13
small but one, and most of the foe
were in the large one. Our men
went to work as still as they could,
and in a short time the large house
and some of the small huts were in
a blaze. This made the foe run out
on all sides with sharp yells of fright,
and our men shot them as if they
were mad dogs.
We heard the noise and saw the
light, and I said to the men who
were with me in the boat, we must
get help from the ship, and go and
see what this means. The men from
the ship came with us, and the light
from the fire was so great that we
found our way to the town; and what
a sight there was here! the dead foes
lay all round, the huts were in flames,
and our men were more like wild
beasts than men. I was like one that
had been struck dumb with fright.
When they saw us, they came up to
us and one of them said, "I am so
glad you have come, but we are not
half done yet."
At this, I said, with a loud voice,
"Wretch! what are you at? What
does this mean? If you do not stop,
I will shoot you down like a dog."
"Why, sir," said he, "if you want
to know why we have done this,
come here;" and he led me to where
poor Tom hung.
I told him that Tom had done
wrong, and the black men were not
to blame; that he would do the same
if he had the same cause; but this
did no good, and when the rest of
the men came up, and saw Tom,
they were just as bad. They said this
man was right, and they would kill
all the men they could find.
As I could not stop them, I went
off; and the thought of that day's
work made me sad for a long time,
for I felt that God's wrath must be
on our men.
The next day we set sail, and for
a few weeks all went well. One day
we had to stop at a small town on
the coast to get some food, and I
thought I would go on shore and
look round to see what kind of a
place it was.
While I was gone the men on the
ship had a talk, and they told the
man in charge that I must not come
back on the ship, for they were mad
at what I said to them on the
isle. They said I had no right to
scold them, and they did not like
me, and that he must leave me on
shore. He told them that he could
not do this; that I had a large share
in the ship, and he must take me
with him. But they would not hear
a word of this; they said they would
"one and all" leave the ship, and he
could run the boat. So he had to
come on shore to me, and when he
told me all they had said, I thought,
for his sake, I would stay, for if these
men left him, I did not see where he
was to get a crew from; so I told
him to send me all the things that
were in my room on the ship, and
to send me some gold as soon as he
could.
The next morn he sent me my
goods, and with them his own man
to wait on me. And now, once
more, I was left in a strange land.
But I found the men here were kind,
and full of good will, and that ships
came by two or three times a week;
there were some folks here from my
own land, and with one of these I
got good board for me and my man.
CHAPTER
XX.
I was in this place nine months,
and made some warm friends. I
bought some fine gems, and some
drugs, as well as some goods which
I thought would be good to trade.
There was a man in the same
house with me, and he thought that if
we were to hire a ship, and take our
goods to a land that was not far off,
we could do well; for, said he, "Why
should we stand still here? there are
no drones in the world but men, and
why should we be of that class?"
It took us some time to get a ship
to our minds, and we had hard work
to pick up a crew, but we found some
Dutch men who said they would go;
we put all our goods on board, and
set sail.
On our way out, we found the
ship was an old and poor one, and
that we should have to stop and fix
it; so we put in port at a large place,
and I told the mate, as we would
have to wait for a few days, I would
go on shore and see if I could find
some goods we could take with us.
I found here some ships and men
from my own land, and some from
the East. I saw, too, there were some
fine goods and fruits which I knew
would be of great use to us, and I
thought I would lay in a large stock,
so went each day to buy some.
One day the man of whom I had
bought most of my goods, said to
me, "I think it would be best for
you to leave here as soon as you can,
for there are some men here who say
they will burn your ship and hang
you." "Hang me! what for?"
"Well, they have heard some strange
things, and I thought I would tell
you, and warn you in time."
For a long while I could not speak;
for I did not know how they could
hear of me, as this was the first time
in my life I had been there, but I
gave him my thanks and went right
on board the ship, and told the mate
what I had heard; and he said he
thought the ship was all right now,
and we could set sail that day.
There was quite a strong breeze,
and it was not long when we were
some way out to sea, and by night
we thought we were out of their
reach, but the next morn I was
down in one of the rooms of the ship,
when one of the men put his head
in the door and said, there were five
boats full of men in full chase for us.
I went up and saw the mate, and
we brought all the men up on deck,
and told them we thought these men
meant to seize our ship and take and
hang us all. I said to them, "Will
you stand by us?" and they all said
they would live or die with us. Our
mate said he thought the best way
was to keep them off with our great
shot as long as we could, and then
to fire on them with our small arms,
and we must try to keep them down
off the deck of the ship.
When they were most up to us,
we hung out a white flag, but, as they
would not heed this, we took it in and
hung out a red one, to show them
we would fight for our lives, and then
we sent them such a good round
of great shot that they kept off for
some time, and when they came up
once more, we sent such a blast of
fire from five of our great guns, that
it took off the stern of one of their
boats, so that it soon sank; and the
men who had charge of our guns
kept up the fire for a long while,
which hurt them and their boats so
much they were glad to give up and
let us go.
There were two men who were
hurt so that they could not swim,
and they were in the sea so close to
our ship that we took them in. One
of these men was a Dutch man, and
he told us the cause of all this was
that the man of whom we had bought
o
the ship was in port with us, and he
had told the men there we were a
bad set of men; that we went up and
down on the sea to rob ships, and that
we had stole the ship we had. This
made them so mad they made up
their minds to come and take us
and the ship to the land, and hang
us all, and not wait to hear the
truth.
We could not make out what this
meant, but when we came to ask
more of this man, we found the man
we had bought our ship from was a
thief, and that he was on board of the
ship with this Dutch man, and that
he would not mind the men in
charge of the ship, and one day he
got mad and shot the head man, and
got some more of the men to join
him, and they ran off with the ship,
and took it to the place where we
first saw him, and sold it to us, and
in some way he came to this last
place, and when he saw us he thought
he might be found out, so had told
this, a lie, to the men, and then said
to this Dutch man if he told the
truth he would kill him; but we had
been so brave that they could not
stand our fire arms, and so had left
us.
All went on well for some days,
when we found that our ship had
sprung a leak, way down on one
side. We did not know what to do.
We must fix it, or it would go down;
and we did not want to go on
shore, for we did not know what
foe we might meet.
I told the men to let down our
small boat, and all that could must
get in, while the rest took in the
sails of the ship; and they took all
the things of great weight and put
them in on one side, and then lay
her up as high as they could on
the beach; and when they had made
a sort of stage to stand on, they
went to work to stop up the leak
and to tar the side of the ship.
There were five of us in the small
boat, and the rest of the men were
at work on the side of the ship,
and we were but a short way from
the land.
The men who dwelt there did not
know what to make of our ship, and
as they saw just a few men they
thought it would be a good chance
to come down and take our goods;
and what few men they saw, they
could make slaves of, or sell to their
king; so they got out some small
boats, and put eight or ten men in
each, and they came up to where we
were.
When I saw what they meant to
do, I told the men to let the stage
slip down in the sea, and we all went
up on deck as soon as we could;
and when they came quite close to
us, two or three of them thought
they would try and climb up the side
of the ship. One of our men stood
near the hot pitch pot, and he took
up a great spoon full, and threw it
on them, which soon sent them down
with a cry of pain. "Well done,
Jack," said one of the men, "give
them some more," which he did, for
he took up the spoon and sent out
the hot stuff to the right and left, on
all sides.
This they could not stand long, for
they went off with cries and howls
of pain, which we heard for some
time.
We then went on with our work,
and, in a day or so, the ship was all
right, and we went on our way. We
did not stop, but went straight north,
and in less than a month we came to
the land (as those who live there call
it) of the Sun.
We went from port to port; in one
place we would sell our goods, and
in the next we would buy more. I
thought I would like to see more of
this land, than I could do in a ship;
so when we came to the port of one
of their large towns, we sold our ship
and took our goods, and went on
shore. Here we met some men who
were on their way to the chief town
in the land, where there was to be
a great fair, and they said they would
like us to join them.
One of the men was a Scot; he
had been here for a long time, and
knew all their ways, and he said he
could show us the land and how to
trade with the men. We said we
would join them, and made the Scot
our head or chief; we gave him part
of our gold and told him to pay our
bills, and to lead us at all times. We
thought it best to take a guide too,
and we soon found that we had need
of both head and guide.
I must tell you of the queer men
who dwelt in this land. They were
light and wore long loose coats like
a blouse, and shoes that were made
of wood; their hair, which was black,
hung in long braids down their
backs; they were smart, and made
lots of fine goods, like fans, shawls,
silks, and dress goods. They did
not know the true God, but had
gods of their own, which they made
of wood and stone, and they would
take these gods with them from place
to place.
One day we saw one on the
ground; it was quite large and had
horns; the sight of it made me sad,
and I felt that I must tell them of
our Lord. Our chief said they
would not heed me; that they did
not like strange men to go through
their land, much less to talk of their
gods, and they might get mad at me,
and kill us all. But I still clung to
the thought, and the more I saw of
these things the more pain I felt, and
I thought, "how I would like to
burn up all these gods." In one
place we met a priest who had been
there for some time, and I had a
long talk with him. He said my zeal
was all right, but it would do no
good for me to treat their gods in
this way or to say much to them; most
of the men could not read or write,
and that they would not know what
we meant; they would not like it,
and, as my chief had said, would
drive us all out. We must leave
them to those who could be sent
from our own land to teach them; it
would be slow work, for they must
be made to feel and know that they
were friends, and did not mean to
harm them; we must pray for them
and leave the rest to God. I saw
he was right, and we went on; but
I made up my mind that I would
do all I could when I got home to
send them help.
One day we came to a large town,
and we thought we would stay here
for a day or two; we found the chief
work of the men here was to make
a fine kind of ware, out of a sort of
clay, which they have a great deal
of; in fact, we did not see much else
but pots, pans, cups, jars, and such
like things. Our guide said he would
like to show us a house all built of
this kind of ware.
I told him I would like to have it
to take home with me, for I thought
he meant a toy house. "Take it
home!" he said with scorn, "why,
there are near two score men in it."
When I came to it I found that
it was a large house built of laths,
and this ware put on them like tiles.
The walls and floors were made of
these tiles; some were blue and white,
some were green, and some of a dark
gray hue. There were ponds with
gold fish in, and the walks in the
yards were all made in this same
odd way.
Our guide did naught but brag of
all the great things they could do;
and when we came to the Great
Wall, which is built for miles and
miles round, he said to me, "What
do you think of that?" I told him
it might do to keep out the men they
stood in fear of, but if some of the
men in my land were to come with
their strong fire arms, they would
knock it down in a short time. When
he heard this he was mute for a long
while, and he did not say much
more of the might of his men.
We now went to the chief town
in the land, and it was full of men
from all parts of the land, who had
come with their goods to the great
fair there. We bought a lot of fans,
shawls, silks, and small toys and
tea. Most of these I sent home to
my friend, who sent me back a large
sum of gold for them.
One day our chief told us there
was to be a great hunt that day, and
he thought we would like to go. I
said to him, "What kind of a hunt?"
He said, "A sheep hunt." This
made us all laugh. The sheep are
shy, but wild, and though swift, they
will not run far, and as they keep
close you are sure to get some.
While we were out we saw two
score of those wild hordes who roam
from place to place, to rob or kill all
whom they may meet; and though
they have no skill to fight, they do
a great deal of harm.
When they saw us they blew a
kind of horn quite loud. This we
knew was to call some of their
friends, and in a short time a score
more came up.
One of our men said this was not
the first time he had seen them, and
he knew just how to deal with them.
He told us we had no time to lose,
and that we must form a line, and
all fire at once when he gave the
word. We did as he told us, and
they let fly their darts, but none of
us were hurt; there were five of them
shot, and the rest fled, and we saw
no more of them.
We went on for a month more,
through the rest of this strange land,
and saw much that was new as
well as queer to us.
As we had seen all we had a
wish to in this land, we thought we
would go to the North Sea, and in
five months we were in a large town
near the coast, but the snow was so
great and it was so cold that I did
not care to stay here long; so I went
a few miles south.
I found this land to be the place
where they send the men who do
not like or mind the Czar (as they
,call their king), and here I met some
men of high rank, and a prince, who
had been sent here, as they could
not make up their minds to think
and do all that the Czar would ask
them to. The prince was a fine
man, full of good deeds and
thoughts.
I told these men my life on the isle,
and of the men I had left there.
They said they thought it a great
and strange case, but that I had
great cause for joy; I was lord of all
while I was there, and could do as I
had a wish, and that my men must
love me, as I had shown them so
much thought and care, which was
more than the Czar had done for
them. I could not keep the prince
and his sad lot out of my mind, and
I thought I would like to have him
go to my own land with me. I said
to him one day, "I have been here a
long time, and think I ought to go
home ; how would you like to go
with me, if you could get off?" At
first, he did not want me to talk to
him of it, but when he had thought
of it for a while, he said that he did
not think he ought to go in that
way, but if I would like to serve or
aid him, I could take with me one
that was near and dear to him, and
that was his son. He did not like to
see him kept here; as he had done
no wrong; he had been sent with
him when a child, and had grown
up here.
The next day he sent for his son,
who had been for some months with
some friends not a great way off.
When I saw the young man my
'neart went right out to him, he was
so like the prince, full of .We ami
kind thoughts for all.
He did not want to leave the
prince, but we made him see it war
for his own good, and that he might
do more for the prince if he went
with me, than he could do there.
The prince gave me a fine let
of skins and furs, and I gave him
some of the goods I had brought
with me, and in a month we left the
place.
We went through two or three
new lands, and in one of them the
young lord found some friends who
said they could help the prince, if
the young man would go to their
court with them. Though I was
loth to part with him, I felt it would
not be right for me to keep him; so
I bade him ."good bye," and then
went straight to my place of birth.
I got back to my old home the
first of the year 1705. And now I
made up my mind to stay here.
I had seen near all this world.
God had been good to me through
all. I had no one to blame for the
ills of my life; I had brought them
on by my self will. My days must
now be few, for I had seen more
than three score and ten years, and
it was time for me to think of that
world of peace and love where I
soon must go.
My book of God's Word, that I
found on the ship, I had kept close
by me through all these years; and
now with that for my guide, I will
wait God's good time to cross that
sea, to the shore where all are at
rest. And while I had to wait, I
thought I would write this book, to
show you, first, that if you would
have joy and peace in this world,
you must mind God's fifth law, and
next, that in all the ills and cares of
life, you must seek God, learn to
love and trust Him, and He will
bring you safe home at last.
The End.
