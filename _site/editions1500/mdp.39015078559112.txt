I could see the ship as it lay one end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off.


ROBINSON CRUSOE
I was born in the town of York, in the spring of
1623. When I was but a small boy I would sit
for hours at a time on the banks of a small stream
near our house and dream of ships and the sea.
My friends did all they could to keep me at home,
but when I grew to young manhood I ran off and
found my way on board a ship.
One day there blew up a great gale and for three
days we could not steer the ship, and the high seas
that came on us took off a man and a boy. In the
midst of this one of the men said he saw land, and
we thought we would try to reach it but it was of
no use, and though we did all we could, the boat
struck on a sand bar. There was a small boat
ROBINSON CRUSOE
on the ship which we all got in, but did not have
much hope as the sea was so wild and rough. We
felt that naught but God's care could save us. We
had gone but a short way when there rose a great
wave that swept us all into the sea.

With the aid of the waves I swam for land which
T saw quite a way off and when I reached shore the
first thing I did was to thank God for my life and
then to look for the rest of the men, but they
must have all gone down for I saw them no more.
Not far off I saw a thick fir tree, full of thorns.
I thought I would sleep in it for though I saw no
signs of them I feared both wild men and beasts.
I took my knife and cut a sharp stick and when
it was dark got up in my tree where I slept very
well.
The next morning the sun shone bright and I
could see the ship as it lay one end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off. At noon the sea was
calm and the tide low so I swam out to her. I
spied a small piece of strong rope that hung down
on one side of the ship and by the aid of that and
hard work I reached the deck.
You may be sure my first work was to search for
bread. When I found it I made a good meal.
Then I went to see what there was I could take on
shore. But how to get anything to land? I must
make a raft, I decided, so I took some spare yards,
a mast or two, some large spars of wood and planks.
With some strong rope I made a rough raft which
was quite large and strong. This required much
time and toil, but the fear of starvation urged
me on.
My raft ready, my next care was what to take.
I first laid on some loose planks, then three chests,
in one of which I put my food to keep it dry—
bread, rice, cheese, dry meat and some corn. I
took all the clothes I thought I would need for
some time, and a chest of tools which was my
greatest prize. Last of all I took three good guns,
a bag of shot, two old swords, an old horn and
three kegs of gun dust. I thought I had chosen
wisely.
CHAPTER II
I put all these things on my raft and set off for
land. When I had at last brought my goods up
on the shore, I
sat down to
smoke. I
thought of my
friends at home;
I knew they
would think me
dead, but I did
not see how I
could send them
word or get off
this isle which
did not seem
to have a soul
on it. It was
out of the course
of ships and I felt I was lost to the world. I made
a rude hut with the boards and chests for I knew
I must stay near my goods to watch them. But


I did not sleep
well for the
boards were
hard and I
was in fear of
wild beasts.
The next
morning I
swam to the
ship when the
tide was out,
made a much
smaller raft
and took off
some nails
and spikes, saws and knives, a grindstone on which
to sharpen my tools, a spare top sail and a bed.
Reaching land in safety with my treasure, I went
to work to make a small tent in which I could
sleep as well as store my goods. I put up one
with the sail and some poles I cut and brought in
all the things I thought sun or rain would spoil.
Then I stood all the chests and casks around it
and made a door of some boards and a chest.
When this was done I spread out my bed, put
my guns close by and for the first time since I
had left the ship I laid down and slept well.
For the next six days I went out to the ship when
the tide was low and thought I had found all I
would need, but as long as the ship was there I
felt I must take off all I could get.
The seventh
night the wind
blew hard and
next morning I
found the ship
was gone. I felt

As the ground
on which my tent
stood was low
and wet, I now found a plain on the side of a hill
with a large rock near by. A hole was worn in this
rock like a door to a cave, and there was a flat
green in front of this hole. I fixed the hole to put
my food in and built my tent in front of it on the
green. When it was all done, I brought my goods
and stores here.
As the days went by 1 found I must make a note
of time or I should lose sight of the days and years.
So with my knife I made a great cross out of some
posts and set it up near the shore. I put on it,
"I came here the first of September, 1659" and
each day I cut a notch so I could tell the days of
the week, the month, and the year.
I did not tell you of the two cats that I brought
in my arms from the ship, or of the dog who swam
ashore with me at the same time. The dog was
a great pet and a true friend for years. I thought
if he could but speak to
me and tell me his
thoughts and I could
tell him mine, how glad
I should be!
The next thing for me
to do was to make a
chair on which to sit and
a stand on which to eat.
These I made out of the
short boards I had
brought on the raft from
the ship. I could not
build much at a time as
I had so few tools.
When I needed a board,
I had to cut down a tree,
set it on edge by me,
hew it flat on both sides
with my ax and then
rub it down with my
adze and I could make
but one board from a tree. You can imagine the
toil it took.

When I had wrought out some boards in this
way I made some large shelves and put them all
around the sides of my tent. I laid all my tools
and nails and such things on them, hung up my
guns, and soon had things where I could get at
them and could keep them and my tent neat and
clean.
Each day when I was through with my work, I
would walk to the top of the hill to see if there was
a ship or a sail in sight, and when I came back I
would sit down and cry like a child. My dog and
my cats would come up to me and lick my hands
and look at me as though they would like to help
me, which would soothe me a great deal.


CHAPTER III
One day I caught
some wild birds, a
kind of dove, which
I thought I would
tame. I did so, and
their flesh made very
good food.
As time wore on, I
found I would need
more lights, for when it was dark I had to go to
bed. I had some goats' fat, which I made soft
by the fire, and then I made a wick to put in it
from a piece of old rope, and with the aid of the
sun to dry the clay I fashioned a small dish. In
this way I had a lamp and quite a good light. I
was proud of my success and the evenings became
less tedious for I found I could do many things by
the aid of the crude lamp.
I had some corn left, which was so dry I thought
I could not use it, but the bag would do to keep
some of my things in, so I tossed the corn out
on the ground. In a few days the rain set in for
a month, and one day I saw a few green stalks.
I did not know what they were, but after a week I
decided the corn had sprung up. And that same
day when I took my walk I found stalks of rice. I
was sure of food, at any rate!
The rain continued, and I felt cold, which I
thought was queer for I was sure this isle was near
the Equator. The next day I had a hard chill
and fever ollowed. I was very ill for two weeks.
I was too sick to use my gun and almost dead with
thirst. I was far too weak to go out to get a drink,
and as I lay on my bed my whole thought was
"What shall I do?"
One night I had a strange dream. I saw a great
black cloud and a man whose face shone like fire
came out of it.
He held a
spear in his
hand and
said, "Thou
wilt not pray
or turn and
love me; now
thou shalt
die," and he
took up the
spear as if he
!:.meant to kill
me. I gave a
cry and woke
with a start.
The next day I
was ill at ease


and the dream was on
my mind. I searched
for that best of all -
books, God's Word,
and found it in one
of the chests. The
first words I read
were, "Call on me, I
will help thee." I
knelt down to pray
with a sense that
God was near and
would help and hear me. That night I slept well,
and when I woke next morning was much better.
When the rain was over and I grew strong once
more, I made up my mind to tour the isle. I
went two miles up the creek and found a ridge of
hills where grapes
were growing and the
fruit was in its
Prime. I took back
with me all I could
carry and hung the
grapes in the sun to
dry. When I took them
down they were sweet and
dry and I knew I could keep
them a long time.

I found by my post I had been on the isle one
year and had seen no signs of a ship yet. I decided
I should have to dwell there a long time and must
think how I should live and what was best for
me to do.
I thought I
would like some
bread, but to have
this I must have
meal, and so I must
raise the corn. I
made a spade of
wood and dug up
the ground with it
instead of a plow
and used the bough
of a tree for a rake.
I put in some corn
and some rice. It did not yield much the first
year as it was sown too late, and the next year the
hares would tread it down at night and the birds
would eat it by day. I set my dog to catch the
hares and I made a trap for the birds, and the
third year I had a good crop.
You would smile were you to see me and my pets
sit down to dine. First there I was, prince and
lord of the whole isle, and Poll on the back of my
chair, and my dog at my feet and my cats on each

/
side of me, all on the watch for bits I would feed
them from my hands. Poll was a young bird I
had caught, and I taught her to talk. The first
time she spoke my name it gave me a great start, I
had not heard a voice but my own for so long.

CHAPTER IV
As I now had so much corn and rice, I thought
of my bread.
I wondered and wondered how I should grind my
corn and bake my bread. I must have some pots
or jars to keep my meal in. I thought of my clay
lamp and set to work to make a sort of paste with
the clay and sand on the beach. You would laugh
were I to tell you the ways I took to make this
paste and what odd things I made; how some of

them fell in and some of them fell out and others
would crack with the heat of the sun. But I kept
on and at last I had two large pots. But I could
not bake or cook in them. One day a piece fell in
the fire and when I took,it cut it was burnt as hard
as a stone and as red as a tile. I now made up my
mind to burn all my pots and in a few weeks I had
a nice lot of large jars, round pots and a flat dish.
How glad I was, now I could bake bread, boil
meat and make some broth!
•
I had been on the isle four years and still no ship
came. I "could see land some way off from the isle
and each day I would look at it and long to go
and see what was there, but fear of wild men I
thought might live there kept me back. But I
determined to make a boat. To do this I cut
down a large tree and took the trunk and made it
in shape with my ax and adze. I did not stop to
think how I should get it to the sea.
It took me three months to do this, and I was
full of hope and thought what a good time I should
have and how I would sail off in it.
When it was hewn out and fit for me to launch,
it was so large that do all I could, it was impossible
for me to move it. I
thought I would dig a
trench around it and see
if I could slide it down
to the sea, but it was of
no use. So I left it to go
back to work on my
farm; I felt I must make
up my mind to end my
days here.
I had a large flock of
goats, good crops of
corn and rice, and the
means to cook. The most I needed now was

clothes. I had worn
out all that I had car-
ried off the ship and I
was in rags. When I
would kill a goat, I
would save the skin
and hang it in the sun
to dry. In this way I
had quite a large stock
of nice skins.
The first thing I
made of these was a
great cap for my head
and I made this so well
I cut out a whole suit. I put the hair of the skin
out, so that it would shed the rain. The coat was
long and loose and made fast to the waist withabelt.
The trousers were more difficult to make, but
patience conquered
and a new suit was
mine.
The next thing
was a sort of shade,
to take with me
when I went out, to
shield me from sun
and rain. I made a
frame and put a


skin on it, but though I could make it spread, I
had hard work to make it let down. However, I
did at last and found it of great use to me.
One more year went
by and this I think was
one of the best spent on
the isle. I could not keep
my thoughts from a
boat, and went to work
to make a small one.
When it was done, I put:;?
a mast and a sail on it,
and made a place in
which to stow my arms
and food. I put my
shade on one end to
shield me from the hot
sun and, with gun and food aboard, set out to view
my isle.
This was in the sixth year of my reign. Was I
destined to end my days thus?
CHAPTER V
When I had been out three days a great gale
came up and drove me out to sea. The fourth
day the wind went down and I put on all my sail
and wind and tide carried me up on the end of the
isle a great way from home. Here I left the boat

and walked home, and when I came to my place
I was so worn out that I threw myself on the
ground in the shade of one of my trees and fell in
a deep sleep.
For some time I kept at home, but one day I
thought I would walk down and look at my boat.
When quite near it I saw the print of a man's foot
in the sand—toes, heel and all parts of a foot. I
went up and down the shore, my dog following me
but saw no one. I
went back to my tent
as fast as ever I
could. I could not
sleep at all that
night and for three
days kept very close
indoors, but the
want of food finally
drove me out. I
looked all around,
and as I saw no one,
concluded the mark
I had seen might
have been the print
of my own foot—but
still fear held me
^ tight in its grip. Two
or three more years


went by and I saw no signs
of the men and thought that
after all the print of a man's
foot was not so great a
thing to fear. I now felt at
ease, and could take short
sails in my boat and take walks along the shore of
the isle.
One day I went to the top of the hill to look out
at the sea. I thought I saw a boat but it was so
far off it did not look more than a speck, and as I
did not have a glass with me I could not make it
out. I went on down the hill to a part of the isle
never visited by me before, when I saw close to the
shore a pit where a fire had
been made, and all around
were strewn the burnt bones
of men. hi the sight of
these I grew sick, and went
up .the hill with all the
speed I could and when I
reached my tent burst into
a flood of tears.
I took my boat up in a
safe place and brought all
the things in her to my tent.
I kept watching but did not
see them for a long while.

One morn I went out to look at my boat and
there I discovered five small boats drawn up on the
shore quite close by and near them fully three score
of black men. I ran home with all possible speed
and put up all my belongings as safely as I could,
stuck my ax and sword in my belt, took my gun
and my glass and climbed to the top of the hill to
watch them.
CHAPTER VI
r
I saw some of them dance
around the fire whileothers
went off. They soon came
back, bringing two
slaves bound hand
and foot. They cut
their bonds and left
one to stand while
they went to work to
cut the other one up.
When the first
found he was free, he
bounded off and
straight to the road
that led to my house.
When the rest saw
him run, they gave
full chase.

I hurried to my tent with all the speed 1 could
and got one more gun, thinking, "I will save the
poor fellow if I can." On coming out I found that
all but two of the pursuers had turned back, and
that the poor slave was quite close to me. I made
a sign for him to come closer, and then I went up
to the men. The first I gave a hard blow with the
butt of my gun. He dropped as though dead.
The second took quick aim at me with his bow and
to save my own fife I fired. He fell like a stone.
The fire and the noise of my gun gave the poor
slave such a fright he could not move, so I made
signs to him to come to me and that I would not
harm him. He made
all sorts of signs that
he would like to wait
on me and serve me
and at last lay his
head on the ground
close to my feet and
took one of them in
his hand and laid it
on his head, meaning
he would serve me
as long as he
should live. I let
him know that I was glad.. I soon taught him a
few words and my name. I named him from

_
the day on which I found him, which was Friday.
I went to work to see if I could make him some
clothes. I found some things in one of the chests
and I made him a goatskin coat and a hareskin
cap. At first he said they hurt him and that he
could not walk in the suit, but in a few days he
said they were nice and all right and was quite
proud to think his clothes were as good as my own.

I now had two mouths to feed and knew I must
raise more grain. This would mean more work on
my farm. I told Friday he must help which he
was glad to do, to show his love for me. I taught
him how to beat and sift the corn. Then I let him
see me mix and bake bread, and soon Friday could
do all my work as well as I myself.

CHAPTER VII
One day I sent Friday to the shore to see if he
could find one of those large crabs we used for food.
He had not been gone long when I saw him on the
run, crying, "Oh, sir, they are come, they are come!"
I thought he meant the black men had returned
and ran out to see but found it was a strange ship.
I saw them put out a long boat and three men
securely bound were lowered into it, and then five
men rowed it to the shore.
When they
reached land I
saw one of the
men raise his
sword to strike
one of the
bound men,
who hung his
head as if he
would let him
do what he
would. Then he
did the same to
the other two
and set them
free. The five
men stepped
into the boat but as the tide was low they could


not get her off the sand. The five men
sat down near by while the three who
had been bound went off a short way
and sat down in the shade of a tree.
Taking all the arms I thought Friday
and I could use, I went to the men and
said, "Sirs, who are you and why are you here?"
One man acted as spokesman, saying, "My name
is John Smith. We are from Hull and that is my
ship out there. We were bound to the South Sea
Isles, but my crew has mutinied and now they
have thrust me, with my mate and one other, out
on this isle to die. Those five mean to go back to
my ship and make the rest of the crew go with
them where they please."
"Have they fire-arms?" I asked them next.
"Two guns which they
left on board the ship." \ *
''Well, leave the matter ^ y i \
in my hands," suggested
I. "They are asleep now.
We will make the attack.''
I saw I could trust them
and so gave them each a
gun, and owing to the
suddenness of our attack
the struggle was brief and
victory rested with us.

CHAPTER VIII
We knew those on the ship would come to find the
threemutinyleaders,andwemustgetthebestofthem.
We all went down to the shore and broke a large
hole in the boat and drew it up quite high on the
sand. What few
things there were
in the boat I com-
manded Friday to
take back to my
tent. While we
were at work we
heard the boom of
a gun. It came
from the ship and
was a signal for the men on shore to return. But
when the men out on the ship found the row boat
did not move they let down another which was
manned by ten sailors and rowed to shore. When
they came up to where the boat lay and they saw no
one in it, three of them patrolled the shore, sending
up loud yells to make their friends hear. But as
this effort brought no response, all but one came
ashore and went off to the south side of the isle for
a consultation. They at last returned and we
thought would row back to the ship and we would
lose them and the ship too. So I sent Friday and
the mate down a short way and told them to call.

» _».
When the men heard their shout, they ran up and
down the shore, and when three of them approached
near enough at a sign from me Friday and the mate
shot them. One fell dead, a second was severely
wounded while the third cried out, "Who are you?"
The mate answered, "The mate! Yield, or you
are all dead men!"
He said, "To whom do
rwe surrender?"
"John Smith! He is
here with the king and
five score of men. If you
do not yield, you are all
lost." At which they laid
down their arms and in a
short time we had them
bound hand and foot.
John Smith and the
mate went out to the ship and found the three men
now manning her glad indeed to be free of the
mutineers and ready to serve John Smith loyally
and faithfully. When they had put things to
rights on board the ship, they brought her up to
the isle. I was on the top of the hill when she
swung in close to the shore, and John Smith came
up to me and said, "My dear friend, there is your
ship, for she is yours and we are yours, and all
that is in her is yours."


This was too much for me, and I was like one that
is dumb. I threw myself into the open arms of
John Smith and shed tears of joy.
There was the ship, her sails all set, and her flags
thrown out to the breeze and I could now go home!
So I embraced good John Smith and told him I
would go with bun for I felt he had been sent to me
from God.
We went down on board of the ship and John
Smith gave me a whole suit of clothes, which I
put on. I felt strange, and could scarcely get
around in them. I thought of poor Friday the
first time he had his clothes on.
John Smith thought we ought to go right off,
but I told him we ought to see to the men we had
left bound on the isle. So I went to them and
told them I had come from the king and that he
had said I might set them free if they would swear
they would stay on the isle
and work the land, for if they
went back with us they would
all be hung for having mu-
tinied on board the ship.
I took Friday, one of my
Polls, my goatskin cap and
coat, and went on board the
ship, and the next day dawn-
ing bright and clear, we set
sail for home.
I had been on the isle a
score and eight years, and
to whose love and care did I owe all—my life, my
health, these friends, with the ways and means to
get home to my own dear land? It was on this isle
that I had been brought to know God, and my
heart rose in praise to Him, and I knelt down to
thank Him for all He had done for me.



Crusoe's
Own
Boat

CINDERELLA.

The Prince danced with Cinderella and begged
to know where she came from but
she would not tell him.
Once upon a time, many
years ago there lived a certain
rich gentleman who lost his
wife and had just one little
girl. After a long time he
married again because he
thought it would be better
for his little girl as he had to
be away from home so much
This second wife had two
daughters of her own and she
was very proud of them but
they were very selfish and dis-
agreeable girls. In fact, as
soon as the father would be
away on a journey, mother and daughters too
would be unkind to little Ella or Cinderella as they
called her. You see they made her stay by the
great open fireplace and tend the fire until she was
all covered with ashes. She was compelled to do
all the hard work in the household. She scoured
the dishes, scrubbed the floors and gathered faggots
to burn in the great open fire. She liked to do this,
however, for it took her to the forest and she loved
to listen to the wind whispering in the tops of the
tall pine trees. She used to think it sounded like
fairies playing on little harps.


And once in the forest she found a little lost
kitten and brought it home and it lived with her in
the big fireplace, and they would both sit and watch
the fire. The cat was company for Cinderella
though she could not understand anything the
cat told her. It sounded just like purring, but
if she had understood the cat language she would
have known how much the cat loved her.
As time went on, Cinderella grew more ragged
and her long golden hair more tangled, but her
little face grew more beautiful because she was both
kind and patient.
Then one day it became known that the King
of that country had ordered a great ball. It was
to be held three nights and all the girls of that
kingdom were to attend, for the most beautiful
was to be chosen as the betrothed of the young
Prince.

going to attend and how beautiful
were going to be. Cinderella heard
and wanted to go. She begged and
the stepmother and
the two proud sisters
laughed her to scorn
and said,
"How would you
look at the King's ball
in your rags and your
wooden shoes and all
covered with cinders?"
Cinderella begged
them to loan her one
of their very oldest
party dresses—any
one would do. But
they just laughed on
and turned up their
noses at her.
So every-
one, young
and old, was
talking a-
bout the
Grand Ball,
and how
they were
their dresses
about it too,
pleaded, but

Then Cinderella went back to
her fireplace, the tears rolling
down her cheeks. The little
cat crept near and tried to
comfort her.

But it was hard indeed to see the stepmother
and the two proud sisters start for the ball and to
te left behind.
Just then a poor old woman came to the door
and begged for something to eat. Cinderella
was so sorry for her that she gave the old woman
all her own supper. Then a most wonderful thing
happened—the old woman turned into a little Fairy


Godmother in less than a minute, who
smiled and said, "For your kind heart,
little Cinderella, I will grant you any-
thing you wish."
Cinderella could scarce believe her ears, but she
said, "Oh, Fairy Godmother, I wish I could go to
the King's ball!"
"Nothing easier!" answered the fairy. "But bring
me the biggest pumpkin, for you will need a coach."
Cinderella remembered seeing a huge one in the
garden, and truly it was so big she found she
could hardly carry it into the house.
"Now I shall need some rats and some mice,"
said the fairy, and as Cinderella remembered where
the traps were, she managed to bring them in,
though she disliked touching the creatures. But
the Fairy Godmother just touched them with her
wand and the pumpkin turned into a great golden
coach and the rats into six lovely white prancing
ponies with long flowing manes and wavy tails,
and the mice became coachmen all in fine livery.
You never saw anything quite so fine. Cinderella
was so surprised and delighted she could not speak.
Looking at the coach, then at herself, she asked,
"But how can I go to the ball in these rags?"
She had no more than uttered the words before
the Fairy touched her with her wand and lo! Gin-

derella's clothes were changed in a twinkling.
From the little golden crown on her head to the
dear little golden glass slippers on her tiny feet
everything she wore was lovely. She tried to thank

the Fairy Godmother, but instead the Fairy hur-
ried her into the great coach, warning her to re-
member one thing: she must leave the ball at
twelve o'clock or all her fine things would turn
back to rags and the coach disappear. Cinderella
promised—and the coachmen cracked their whips
and off the ponies galloped to the King's ball.
When Cinderella appeared in the palace everyone
wondered who this beautiful princess could be.
Her clothes were handsomer and her jewels were
brighter than any others there. When the Prince
led her out to dance, even the stepmother and her
two proud daughters looked on in envy, exclaim-
ing over her loveliness.
Right in the midst of her
happiness, while she was
dancing with the Prince,
Cinderella remembered her
promise about twelve
o'clock, and as she looked at
the big clock
saw it was only
a minute of the
hour. She had
to hurry, but
managed to get
off just in time.
Thenextnight
Cinderella came
dressed finer
than before, and
again astonish-
ed everyone by
her beauty and
wonderful clothes. The
Prince danced with her more
than ever, and begged her to tell
him where she came from but she would not.


She had so very much to think about during the
evening, she very nearly forgot all about the hour
she must leave. Indeed, the clock began to strike
—but she got away in time.
But oh, the last night—that was the best of all!
Cinderella had never looked so lovely, the Prince
vowed he would marry no one but her, and in the
midst of it all the clock struck twelve.
Cinderella had to run for her life—and dropped
one of her golden glass slippers as she rushed out-
doors. As she ran her clothes all changed back to
rags. Her coach had disappeared and she saw the
last rat scurry away under the bushes. She had
to run all the way home, and at last she sank down
in the ashes by the fireplace all out of breath.
As the stepmother and the
proud sisters reached home after
the ball, Cinderella heard them
talking about the wonderful mys-
terious princess, how she had sud-
denly disappeared, how the Prince
searched everywhere for her, how
he had found one of her tiny glass
slippers and how he was going to
have the whole kingdom searched
until he found her. Indeed, he
declared he would marry no one
but this
beautiful
princess.
The
very next
day criers
were dis-
patched
far and
near
through
the kingdom reading
a proclamation
from the King,
saying that the
lady who could


wear the tiny glass slipper was to wed the prince.
The very next day two of the Royal Courtiers of
the King went to every house with the little glass
slipper to find its owner, but no foot was small
enough though it was said some cut off their toes
trying to get it on. At last they came to the house
of the proud stepmother. She tried to put it on
but her foot was much too wide and much too fat.
Then the elder daughter tried, but she couldn't
even get her toe in it. And the younger tried very,
very hard, but could not get it on at all. Then the
Royal Courtiers demanded to know if there was no
one else in the house, and they said, "No—no one
but Cinderella with her rags and old wooden shoes."
But the Courtiers said, "Bring her to us," and
so Cinderella had to come out of the chimney corner
and try on the slipper. She sat down on a little
bench—and on went the slipper just as easy—and
in that momentrshe was changed to the lovely being
that she had been at the King's ball. While every-

one stood astonished, the Fairy Godmother ap-
peared and pointed her wand at the stepmother
and her daughters, and said:
"It was your own evil thoughts and selfish na-
tures that made you ugly and unloved."
When the Prince heard the good news that the
beautiful maiden had been found, he came himself
in the royal
coach to es-
cort her
back to the
palace.
And they
were mar-
ried at once
with great
pomp and
ceremony
and lived
happily
ever after.
You may
be sure too
that Cin-
derella did
not forget
to bring
her little

cat to the palace. There she learned to carry Cin-
derella's train and was a great pet with every one—
and wore a gold collar all set with diamonds.


N





I could see the ship as it lay one end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off.

ROBINSON CRUSOE
I was born in the town of York, in the spring of
1623. When I was but a small boy I would sit
for hours at a time on the banks of a small stream
near our house and dream of ships and the sea.
My friends did all they could to keep me at home,
but when I grew to young manhood I ran off and
found my way on board a ship.
One day there blew up a great gale and for three
days we could not steer the ship, and the high seas
that came on us took off a man and a boy. In the
midst of this one of the men said he saw land, and
we thought we would try to reach it but it was of
no use, and though we did all we could, the boat
struck on a sand bar. There was a small boat
on the ship which we all got in, but did not have
much hope as the sea was so wild and rough. We
felt that naught but God's care could save us. We
had gone but a short way when there rose a great
wave that swept us all into the sea.

With the aid of the waves I swam for land which
T saw quite a way off and when I reached shore the
first thing I did was to thank God for my life and
then to look for the rest of the men, but they
must have all gone down for I saw them no more.
Not far off I saw a thick fir tree, full of thorns.
I thought I would sleep in it for though I saw no
signs of them I feared both wild men and beasts.
I took my knife and cut a sharp stick and when
it was dark got up in my tree where I slept very
well.
The next morning the sun shone bright and I
could see the ship as it lay one end up out of the
sea, not quite a mile off. At noon the sea was
calm and the tide low so I swam out to her. I
spied a small piece of strong rope that hung down
on one side of the ship and by the aid of that and
hard work I reached the deck.
You may be sure my first work was to search for
bread. When I found it I made a good meal.
Then I went to see what there was I could take on
shore. But how to get anything to land? I must
make a raft, I decided, so I took some spare yards,
a mast or two, some large spars of wood and planks.
With some strong rope I made a rough raft which
was quite large and strong. This required much
time and toil, but the fear of starvation urged
me on.
My raft ready, my next care was what to take.
I first laid on some loose planks, then three chests,
in one of which I put my food to keep it dry—
bread, rice, cheese, dry meat and some corn. I
took all the clothes I thought I would need for
some time, and a chest of tools which was my
greatest prize. Last of all I took three good guns,
a bag of shot, two old swords, an old horn and
three kegs of gun dust. I thought I had chosen
wisely.
CHAPTER II
I put all these things on my raft and set off for
land. When I had at last brought my goods up
on the shore, I
sat down to
smoke. I
thought of my
friends at home;
I knew they
would think me
dead, but I did
not see how I
could send them
word or get off
this isle which
did not seem
to have a soul
on it. It was
out of the course
of ships and I felt I was lost to the world. I made
a rude hut with the boards and chests for I knew
I must stay near my goods to watch them. But


I did not sleep
well for the
boards were
hard and I
was in fear of
wild beasts.
The next
morning I
swam to the
ship when the
tide was out,
made a much
smaller raft
and took off
some nails
and spikes, saws and knives, a grindstone on which
to sharpen my tools, a spare top sail and a bed.
Reaching land in safety with my treasure, I went
to work to make a small tent in which I could
sleep as well as store my goods. I put up one
with the sail and some poles I cut and brought in
all the things I thought sun or rain would spoil.
Then I stood all the chests and casks around it
and made a door of some boards and a chest.
When this was done I spread out my bed, put
my guns close by and for the first time since I
had left the ship I laid down and slept well.
For the next six days I went out to the ship when
the tide was low and thought I had found all I
would need, but as long as the ship was there I
felt I must take off all I could get.
The seventh
night the wind
blew hard and
next morning I
found the ship
was gone. I felt

As the ground
on which my tent
stood was low
and wet, I now found a plain on the side of a hill
with a large rock near by. A hole was worn in this
rock like a door to a cave, and there was a flat
green in front of this hole. I fixed the hole to put
my food in and built my tent in front of it on the
green. When it was all done, I brought my goods
and stores here.
As the days went by 1 found I must make a note
of time or I should lose sight of the days and years.
So with my knife I made a great cross out of some
posts and set it up near the shore. I put on it,
"I came here the first of September, 1659" and
each day I cut a notch so I could tell the days of
the week, the month, and the year.
I did not tell you of the two cats that I brought
in my arms from the ship, or of the dog who swam
ashore with me at the same time. The dog was
a great pet and a true friend for years. I thought
if he could but speak to
me and tell me his
thoughts and I could
tell him mine, how glad
I should be!
The next thing for me
to do was to make a
chair on which to sit and
a stand on which to eat.
These I made out of the
short boards I had
brought on the raft from
the ship. I could not
build much at a time as
I had so few tools.
When I needed a board,
I had to cut down a tree,
set it on edge by me,
hew it flat on both sides
with my ax and then
rub it down with my
adze and I could make
but one board from a tree. You can imagine the
toil it took.

When I had wrought out some boards in this
way I made some large shelves and put them all
around the sides of my tent. I laid all my tools
and nails and such things on them, hung up my
guns, and soon had things where I could get at
them and could keep them and my tent neat and
clean.
Each day when I was through with my work, I
would walk to the top of the hill to see if there was
a ship or a sail in sight, and when I came back I
would sit down and cry like a child. My dog and
my cats would come up to me and lick my hands
and look at me as though they would like to help
me, which would soothe me a great deal.


CHAPTER III
One day I caught
some wild birds, a
kind of dove, which
I thought I would
tame. I did so, and
their flesh made very
good food.
As time wore on, I
found I would need
more lights, for when it was dark I had to go to
bed. I had some goats' fat, which I made soft
by the fire, and then I made a wick to put in it
from a piece of old rope, and with the aid of the
sun to dry the clay I fashioned a small dish. In
this way I had a lamp and quite a good light. I
was proud of my success and the evenings became
less tedious for I found I could do many things by
the aid of the crude lamp.
I had some corn left, which was so dry I thought
I could not use it, but the bag would do to keep
some of my things in, so I tossed the corn out
on the ground. In a few days the rain set in for
a month, and one day I saw a few green stalks.
I did not know what they were, but after a week I
decided the corn had sprung up. And that same
day when I took my walk I found stalks of rice. I
was sure of food, at any rate!
The rain continued, and I felt cold, which I
thought was queer for I was sure this isle was near
the Equator. The next day I had a hard chill
and fever ollowed. I was very ill for two weeks.
I was too sick to use my gun and almost dead with
thirst. I was far too weak to go out to get a drink,
and as I lay on my bed my whole thought was
"What shall I do?"
One night I had a strange dream. I saw a great
black cloud and a man whose face shone like fire
came out of it.
He held a
spear in his
hand and
said, "Thou
wilt not pray
or turn and
love me; now
thou shalt
die," and he
took up the
spear as if he
!:.meant to kill
me. I gave a
cry and woke
with a start.
The next day I
was ill at ease


and the dream was on
my mind. I searched
for that best of all -
books, God's Word,
and found it in one
of the chests. The
first words I read
were, "Call on me, I
will help thee." I
knelt down to pray
with a sense that
God was near and
would help and hear me. That night I slept well,
and when I woke next morning was much better.
When the rain was over and I grew strong once
more, I made up my mind to tour the isle. I
went two miles up the creek and found a ridge of
hills where grapes
were growing and the
fruit was in its
Prime. I took back
with me all I could
carry and hung the
grapes in the sun to
dry. When I took them
down they were sweet and
dry and I knew I could keep
them a long time.

I found by my post I had been on the isle one
year and had seen no signs of a ship yet. I decided
I should have to dwell there a long time and must
think how I should live and what was best for
me to do.
I thought I
would like some
bread, but to have
this I must have
meal, and so I must
raise the corn. I
made a spade of
wood and dug up
the ground with it
instead of a plow
and used the bough
of a tree for a rake.
I put in some corn
and some rice. It did not yield much the first
year as it was sown too late, and the next year the
hares would tread it down at night and the birds
would eat it by day. I set my dog to catch the
hares and I made a trap for the birds, and the
third year I had a good crop.
You would smile were you to see me and my pets
sit down to dine. First there I was, prince and
lord of the whole isle, and Poll on the back of my
chair, and my dog at my feet and my cats on each

/
side of me, all on the watch for bits I would feed
them from my hands. Poll was a young bird I
had caught, and I taught her to talk. The first
time she spoke my name it gave me a great start, I
had not heard a voice but my own for so long.

CHAPTER IV
As I now had so much corn and rice, I thought
of my bread.
I wondered and wondered how I should grind my
corn and bake my bread. I must have some pots
or jars to keep my meal in. I thought of my clay
lamp and set to work to make a sort of paste with
the clay and sand on the beach. You would laugh
were I to tell you the ways I took to make this
paste and what odd things I made; how some of

them fell in and some of them fell out and others
would crack with the heat of the sun. But I kept
on and at last I had two large pots. But I could
not bake or cook in them. One day a piece fell in
the fire and when I took,it cut it was burnt as hard
as a stone and as red as a tile. I now made up my
mind to burn all my pots and in a few weeks I had
a nice lot of large jars, round pots and a flat dish.
How glad I was, now I could bake bread, boil
meat and make some broth!
•
I had been on the isle four years and still no ship
came. I "could see land some way off from the isle
and each day I would look at it and long to go
and see what was there, but fear of wild men I
thought might live there kept me back. But I
determined to make a boat. To do this I cut
down a large tree and took the trunk and made it
in shape with my ax and adze. I did not stop to
think how I should get it to the sea.
It took me three months to do this, and I was
full of hope and thought what a good time I should
have and how I would sail off in it.
When it was hewn out and fit for me to launch,
it was so large that do all I could, it was impossible
for me to move it. I
thought I would dig a
trench around it and see
if I could slide it down
to the sea, but it was of
no use. So I left it to go
back to work on my
farm; I felt I must make
up my mind to end my
days here.
I had a large flock of
goats, good crops of
corn and rice, and the
means to cook. The most I needed now was

clothes. I had worn
out all that I had car-
ried off the ship and I
was in rags. When I
would kill a goat, I
would save the skin
and hang it in the sun
to dry. In this way I
had quite a large stock
of nice skins.
The first thing I
made of these was a
great cap for my head
and I made this so well
I cut out a whole suit. I put the hair of the skin
out, so that it would shed the rain. The coat was
long and loose and made fast to the waist withabelt.
The trousers were more difficult to make, but
patience conquered
and a new suit was
mine.
The next thing
was a sort of shade,
to take with me
when I went out, to
shield me from sun
and rain. I made a
frame and put a


skin on it, but though I could make it spread, I
had hard work to make it let down. However, I
did at last and found it of great use to me.
One more year went
by and this I think was
one of the best spent on
the isle. I could not keep
my thoughts from a
boat, and went to work
to make a small one.
When it was done, I put:;?
a mast and a sail on it,
and made a place in
which to stow my arms
and food. I put my
shade on one end to
shield me from the hot
sun and, with gun and food aboard, set out to view
my isle.
This was in the sixth year of my reign. Was I
destined to end my days thus?
CHAPTER V
When I had been out three days a great gale
came up and drove me out to sea. The fourth
day the wind went down and I put on all my sail
and wind and tide carried me up on the end of the
isle a great way from home. Here I left the boat

and walked home, and when I came to my place
I was so worn out that I threw myself on the
ground in the shade of one of my trees and fell in
a deep sleep.
For some time I kept at home, but one day I
thought I would walk down and look at my boat.
When quite near it I saw the print of a man's foot
in the sand—toes, heel and all parts of a foot. I
went up and down the shore, my dog following me
but saw no one. I
went back to my tent
as fast as ever I
could. I could not
sleep at all that
night and for three
days kept very close
indoors, but the
want of food finally
drove me out. I
looked all around,
and as I saw no one,
concluded the mark
I had seen might
have been the print
of my own foot—but
still fear held me
^ tight in its grip. Two
or three more years


went by and I saw no signs
of the men and thought that
after all the print of a man's
foot was not so great a
thing to fear. I now felt at
ease, and could take short
sails in my boat and take walks along the shore of
the isle.
One day I went to the top of the hill to look out
at the sea. I thought I saw a boat but it was so
far off it did not look more than a speck, and as I
did not have a glass with me I could not make it
out. I went on down the hill to a part of the isle
never visited by me before, when I saw close to the
shore a pit where a fire had
been made, and all around
were strewn the burnt bones
of men. hi the sight of
these I grew sick, and went
up .the hill with all the
speed I could and when I
reached my tent burst into
a flood of tears.
I took my boat up in a
safe place and brought all
the things in her to my tent.
I kept watching but did not
see them for a long while.

One morn I went out to look at my boat and
there I discovered five small boats drawn up on the
shore quite close by and near them fully three score
of black men. I ran home with all possible speed
and put up all my belongings as safely as I could,
stuck my ax and sword in my belt, took my gun
and my glass and climbed to the top of the hill to
watch them.
CHAPTER VI
r
I saw some of them dance
around the fire whileothers
went off. They soon came
back, bringing two
slaves bound hand
and foot. They cut
their bonds and left
one to stand while
they went to work to
cut the other one up.
When the first
found he was free, he
bounded off and
straight to the road
that led to my house.
When the rest saw
him run, they gave
full chase.

I hurried to my tent with all the speed 1 could
and got one more gun, thinking, "I will save the
poor fellow if I can." On coming out I found that
all but two of the pursuers had turned back, and
that the poor slave was quite close to me. I made
a sign for him to come closer, and then I went up
to the men. The first I gave a hard blow with the
butt of my gun. He dropped as though dead.
The second took quick aim at me with his bow and
to save my own fife I fired. He fell like a stone.
The fire and the noise of my gun gave the poor
slave such a fright he could not move, so I made
signs to him to come to me and that I would not
harm him. He made
all sorts of signs that
he would like to wait
on me and serve me
and at last lay his
head on the ground
close to my feet and
took one of them in
his hand and laid it
on his head, meaning
he would serve me
as long as he
should live. I let
him know that I was glad.. I soon taught him a
few words and my name. I named him from

_
the day on which I found him, which was Friday.
I went to work to see if I could make him some
clothes. I found some things in one of the chests
and I made him a goatskin coat and a hareskin
cap. At first he said they hurt him and that he
could not walk in the suit, but in a few days he
said they were nice and all right and was quite
proud to think his clothes were as good as my own.

I now had two mouths to feed and knew I must
raise more grain. This would mean more work on
my farm. I told Friday he must help which he
was glad to do, to show his love for me. I taught
him how to beat and sift the corn. Then I let him
see me mix and bake bread, and soon Friday could
do all my work as well as I myself.

CHAPTER VII
One day I sent Friday to the shore to see if he
could find one of those large crabs we used for food.
He had not been gone long when I saw him on the
run, crying, "Oh, sir, they are come, they are come!"
I thought he meant the black men had returned
and ran out to see but found it was a strange ship.
I saw them put out a long boat and three men
securely bound were lowered into it, and then five
men rowed it to the shore.
When they
reached land I
saw one of the
men raise his
sword to strike
one of the
bound men,
who hung his
head as if he
would let him
do what he
would. Then he
did the same to
the other two
and set them
free. The five
men stepped
into the boat but as the tide was low they could


not get her off the sand. The five men
sat down near by while the three who
had been bound went off a short way
and sat down in the shade of a tree.
Taking all the arms I thought Friday
and I could use, I went to the men and
said, "Sirs, who are you and why are you here?"
One man acted as spokesman, saying, "My name
is John Smith. We are from Hull and that is my
ship out there. We were bound to the South Sea
Isles, but my crew has mutinied and now they
have thrust me, with my mate and one other, out
on this isle to die. Those five mean to go back to
my ship and make the rest of the crew go with
them where they please."
"Have they fire-arms?" I asked them next.
"Two guns which they
left on board the ship." \ *
''Well, leave the matter ^ y i \
in my hands," suggested
I. "They are asleep now.
We will make the attack.''
I saw I could trust them
and so gave them each a
gun, and owing to the
suddenness of our attack
the struggle was brief and
victory rested with us.

CHAPTER VIII
We knew those on the ship would come to find the
threemutinyleaders,andwemustgetthebestofthem.
We all went down to the shore and broke a large
hole in the boat and drew it up quite high on the
sand. What few
things there were
in the boat I com-
manded Friday to
take back to my
tent. While we
were at work we
heard the boom of
a gun. It came
from the ship and
was a signal for the men on shore to return. But
when the men out on the ship found the row boat
did not move they let down another which was
manned by ten sailors and rowed to shore. When
they came up to where the boat lay and they saw no
one in it, three of them patrolled the shore, sending
up loud yells to make their friends hear. But as
this effort brought no response, all but one came
ashore and went off to the south side of the isle for
a consultation. They at last returned and we
thought would row back to the ship and we would
lose them and the ship too. So I sent Friday and
the mate down a short way and told them to call.

» _».
When the men heard their shout, they ran up and
down the shore, and when three of them approached
near enough at a sign from me Friday and the mate
shot them. One fell dead, a second was severely
wounded while the third cried out, "Who are you?"
The mate answered, "The mate! Yield, or you
are all dead men!"
He said, "To whom do
rwe surrender?"
"John Smith! He is
here with the king and
five score of men. If you
do not yield, you are all
lost." At which they laid
down their arms and in a
short time we had them
bound hand and foot.
John Smith and the
mate went out to the ship and found the three men
now manning her glad indeed to be free of the
mutineers and ready to serve John Smith loyally
and faithfully. When they had put things to
rights on board the ship, they brought her up to
the isle. I was on the top of the hill when she
swung in close to the shore, and John Smith came
up to me and said, "My dear friend, there is your
ship, for she is yours and we are yours, and all
that is in her is yours."


This was too much for me, and I was like one that
is dumb. I threw myself into the open arms of
John Smith and shed tears of joy.
There was the ship, her sails all set, and her flags
thrown out to the breeze and I could now go home!
So I embraced good John Smith and told him I
would go with bun for I felt he had been sent to me
from God.
We went down on board of the ship and John
Smith gave me a whole suit of clothes, which I
put on. I felt strange, and could scarcely get
around in them. I thought of poor Friday the
first time he had his clothes on.
John Smith thought we ought to go right off,
but I told him we ought to see to the men we had
left bound on the isle. So I went to them and
told them I had come from the king and that he
had said I might set them free if they would swear
they would stay on the isle
and work the land, for if they
went back with us they would
all be hung for having mu-
tinied on board the ship.
I took Friday, one of my
Polls, my goatskin cap and
coat, and went on board the
ship, and the next day dawn-
ing bright and clear, we set
sail for home.
I had been on the isle a
score and eight years, and
to whose love and care did I owe all—my life, my
health, these friends, with the ways and means to
get home to my own dear land? It was on this isle
that I had been brought to know God, and my
heart rose in praise to Him, and I knelt down to
thank Him for all He had done for me.



Crusoe's
Own
Boat


The Prince danced with Cinderella and begged
to know where she came from but
she would not tell him.
Once upon a time, many
years ago there lived a certain
rich gentleman who lost his
wife and had just one little
girl. After a long time he
married again because he
thought it would be better
for his little girl as he had to
be away from home so much
This second wife had two
daughters of her own and she
was very proud of them but
they were very selfish and dis-
agreeable girls. In fact, as
soon as the father would be
away on a journey, mother and daughters too
would be unkind to little Ella or Cinderella as they
called her. You see they made her stay by the
great open fireplace and tend the fire until she was
all covered with ashes. She was compelled to do
all the hard work in the household. She scoured
the dishes, scrubbed the floors and gathered faggots
to burn in the great open fire. She liked to do this,
however, for it took her to the forest and she loved
to listen to the wind whispering in the tops of the
tall pine trees. She used to think it sounded like
fairies playing on little harps.


And once in the forest she found a little lost
kitten and brought it home and it lived with her in
the big fireplace, and they would both sit and watch
the fire. The cat was company for Cinderella
though she could not understand anything the
cat told her. It sounded just like purring, but
if she had understood the cat language she would
have known how much the cat loved her.
As time went on, Cinderella grew more ragged
and her long golden hair more tangled, but her
little face grew more beautiful because she was both
kind and patient.
Then one day it became known that the King
of that country had ordered a great ball. It was
to be held three nights and all the girls of that
kingdom were to attend, for the most beautiful
was to be chosen as the betrothed of the young
Prince.

going to attend and how beautiful
were going to be. Cinderella heard
and wanted to go. She begged and
the stepmother and
the two proud sisters
laughed her to scorn
and said,
"How would you
look at the King's ball
in your rags and your
wooden shoes and all
covered with cinders?"
Cinderella begged
them to loan her one
of their very oldest
party dresses—any
one would do. But
they just laughed on
and turned up their
noses at her.
So every-
one, young
and old, was
talking a-
bout the
Grand Ball,
and how
they were
their dresses
about it too,
pleaded, but

Then Cinderella went back to
her fireplace, the tears rolling
down her cheeks. The little
cat crept near and tried to
comfort her.

But it was hard indeed to see the stepmother
and the two proud sisters start for the ball and to
te left behind.
Just then a poor old woman came to the door
and begged for something to eat. Cinderella
was so sorry for her that she gave the old woman
all her own supper. Then a most wonderful thing
happened—the old woman turned into a little Fairy


Godmother in less than a minute, who
smiled and said, "For your kind heart,
little Cinderella, I will grant you any-
thing you wish."
Cinderella could scarce believe her ears, but she
said, "Oh, Fairy Godmother, I wish I could go to
the King's ball!"
"Nothing easier!" answered the fairy. "But bring
me the biggest pumpkin, for you will need a coach."
Cinderella remembered seeing a huge one in the
garden, and truly it was so big she found she
could hardly carry it into the house.
"Now I shall need some rats and some mice,"
said the fairy, and as Cinderella remembered where
the traps were, she managed to bring them in,
though she disliked touching the creatures. But
the Fairy Godmother just touched them with her
wand and the pumpkin turned into a great golden
coach and the rats into six lovely white prancing
ponies with long flowing manes and wavy tails,
and the mice became coachmen all in fine livery.
You never saw anything quite so fine. Cinderella
was so surprised and delighted she could not speak.
Looking at the coach, then at herself, she asked,
"But how can I go to the ball in these rags?"
She had no more than uttered the words before
the Fairy touched her with her wand and lo! Gin-

derella's clothes were changed in a twinkling.
From the little golden crown on her head to the
dear little golden glass slippers on her tiny feet
everything she wore was lovely. She tried to thank

the Fairy Godmother, but instead the Fairy hur-
ried her into the great coach, warning her to re-
member one thing: she must leave the ball at
twelve o'clock or all her fine things would turn
back to rags and the coach disappear. Cinderella
promised—and the coachmen cracked their whips
and off the ponies galloped to the King's ball.
When Cinderella appeared in the palace everyone
wondered who this beautiful princess could be.
Her clothes were handsomer and her jewels were
brighter than any others there. When the Prince
led her out to dance, even the stepmother and her
two proud daughters looked on in envy, exclaim-
ing over her loveliness.
Right in the midst of her
happiness, while she was
dancing with the Prince,
Cinderella remembered her
promise about twelve
o'clock, and as she looked at
the big clock
saw it was only
a minute of the
hour. She had
to hurry, but
managed to get
off just in time.
Thenextnight
Cinderella came
dressed finer
than before, and
again astonish-
ed everyone by
her beauty and
wonderful clothes. The
Prince danced with her more
than ever, and begged her to tell
him where she came from but she would not.


She had so very much to think about during the
evening, she very nearly forgot all about the hour
she must leave. Indeed, the clock began to strike
—but she got away in time.
But oh, the last night—that was the best of all!
Cinderella had never looked so lovely, the Prince
vowed he would marry no one but her, and in the
midst of it all the clock struck twelve.
Cinderella had to run for her life—and dropped
one of her golden glass slippers as she rushed out-
doors. As she ran her clothes all changed back to
rags. Her coach had disappeared and she saw the
last rat scurry away under the bushes. She had
to run all the way home, and at last she sank down
in the ashes by the fireplace all out of breath.
As the stepmother and the
proud sisters reached home after
the ball, Cinderella heard them
talking about the wonderful mys-
terious princess, how she had sud-
denly disappeared, how the Prince
searched everywhere for her, how
he had found one of her tiny glass
slippers and how he was going to
have the whole kingdom searched
until he found her. Indeed, he
declared he would marry no one
but this
beautiful
princess.
The
very next
day criers
were dis-
patched
far and
near
through
the kingdom reading
a proclamation
from the King,
saying that the
lady who could


wear the tiny glass slipper was to wed the prince.
The very next day two of the Royal Courtiers of
the King went to every house with the little glass
slipper to find its owner, but no foot was small
enough though it was said some cut off their toes
trying to get it on. At last they came to the house
of the proud stepmother. She tried to put it on
but her foot was much too wide and much too fat.
Then the elder daughter tried, but she couldn't
even get her toe in it. And the younger tried very,
very hard, but could not get it on at all. Then the
Royal Courtiers demanded to know if there was no
one else in the house, and they said, "No—no one
but Cinderella with her rags and old wooden shoes."
But the Courtiers said, "Bring her to us," and
so Cinderella had to come out of the chimney corner
and try on the slipper. She sat down on a little
bench—and on went the slipper just as easy—and
in that momentrshe was changed to the lovely being
that she had been at the King's ball. While every-

one stood astonished, the Fairy Godmother ap-
peared and pointed her wand at the stepmother
and her daughters, and said:
"It was your own evil thoughts and selfish na-
tures that made you ugly and unloved."
When the Prince heard the good news that the
beautiful maiden had been found, he came himself
in the royal
coach to es-
cort her
back to the
palace.
And they
were mar-
ried at once
with great
pomp and
ceremony
and lived
happily
ever after.
You may
be sure too
that Cin-
derella did
not forget
to bring
her little

cat to the palace. There she learned to carry Cin-
derella's train and was a great pet with every one—
and wore a gold collar all set with diamonds.
