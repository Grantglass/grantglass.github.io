563MEMOIR OF DE FOE.

.--._.----

DANIEL Fen, or, as he subsequently styled himself (though
at what time and on what occasion is not known), De Foe,
was born in the year 1661, in the parish of St. Giles, Cripple-
gate, London, where his father, James Foe, followed the
trade of butcher: and these few barren facts constitute all
that is now authentically known of the origin of the author of
ROBINSON Causes. Mr. Wilson, in his "Life and Times of
Daniel De Foe,"--a work abounding with curious and minute
information on the period of which it treats, says: " He had
some collateral relatives, to whom he alludes occasionally in
his writings, but with too much brevity to ascertain the degree
of kindred."

At an early age, De Foe is said to have shown that vivacity
of humour, and that indomitable spirit of independence, that
remained with him through after life: " making a sunhine in:
the shady place " of a prison, and arming him as the champion
of truth and humanity in the most perilous times. The
parents of De Foe were Nonoonformists, and his education was
consonant to the practice of their faith. Family religion
formed an essential part of its discipline; and it was made
matter of conscience to' instruct the children of a family and
its dependents in their social, moral, and religious duties.

The enemies of De Foe vainly endeavoured to sink his repu- .
tation by representing him as having been bred a tradesmen ;

iwe have, however, his own assurance that he was educated
'for the ministry, although he does not state why his destina-
tion was altered. He was at all events placed by his father
at a Dissenting academy at Newington Green, under the
direction of the Reverend Charles Morton, a man of learning
and a judicious teacher, who was subsequentlv defended byxvi ill-Limit: or or; run-t.

his pupil from some usporsions that had been cast upon his
character by an ungrateful scholar who had deserted to the
Church.

Of De Fee's progress under Mr. Morton, it is imPOSSible
now to speak with any certainty. He tells us in one of his
" Reviews " that ho had been master of five languages, and
that he had studied the mathematics, natural philosophy, logic,
'geography, and history. De Foe was, moreover, one of the

' few who, in those days, studied politics asa. science. He went '

Ithrough a. complete course of theology, and his knowledge of
ecclesiastical history was also considerable. Nevertheless, he
was attacked by party malice as " an illiterate person without
education." To this he calmly makes answer 2--" Those
gentlemen who reproach my learning to applaud their own,
shall have it proved that I have more learning than either of
them--because I have more manners." He adds, "I think
I owe this justice to my excellent father still living (1705),
and in whose behalf I fully testify, that if I am a blockhead,
it is nobody's fault but my own."

At one-and-twenty De Foe commenced the vocation--most
perilous in his day--of author ; at which he laboured through
good and through evil report, with great honour to himself,
and enduring benefit to mankind, for half a century. His
first publication was a lampooning answer to L'Estrange's
" Guide to the Inferior Clergy," and was intended to satirize
the prevalent High Church notions of the day.

When the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme, in the year
l655, De Foe was among those who joined the standard of
that hapless nobleman. At the age of four-and-twenty we see
Do Foe a soldier, as ready with his sword as prompt with his

- pen in the cause of rational liberty. Of Monmouth, De Foe
seems to have had some previous knowledge, having often
[seen him at Aylesbury races. where the Duke rode his own .

. 'horses, a circumstance alluded to by our author in his " Tour."
De Foe had the good fortune to escape the vengeance visited
upon so many of the Duke's supporters, and returned in safety
to London; where, leaving the stormy region of politics, he
now directed his attention to trade. The nature of his busi-
ness, according to his own account, was that of a hose-factor,
or the middle man between the manufacturer and the retail
hosier. This concern he carried on for some years, in Free-
man's-court, Cornhill ; Mr. Chalmers says, from 1685 to 1695.:JTJJOIR or m; roe. xvii
0n the 26th of January, 1687-8, having claimed his freedom
by birth, he was admitted a liveryman of London. In the
Chamberlain's book his name was written " Daniel Foe."
When the Revolution took place, Do Foe was a resident
in Tooting, where he was the first person who attempted to
form the Dissenters in the neighbourhood into a regular con-
gregation. He was an ardent worshipper of the Revolution,
and annually commemorated the 4th of November as a day
of deliverance. [
The commercial speculations of De Foe, though at first pros-j
porous, were ultimately unsuccessful. That they were of a
varied chamcter is evident from the fact of his having engaged
with partners in the Spanish and Portuguese trade. It is very
clear, from a passage in his " Review," that he had been a
iiiei'chant-adventurer. In the number for January 27,1711,
he alludes to an old Spanish proverb, "which," says he, " I
learnt when I was in that country. " It further appears that
while residing there, he made himself master of the language.
De Fee's losses by shipwreck it is supposed must have been
very consideiable. In allusion to his misfortunes, Mr.
Chalmers observes: " With the usual imprudence of genius,
he was carried into companies who were gratified by his wit.
He spent those hours with a small society for the cultivation
of polite learning, which he ought to have employed in the
calculations of the counting-house; and, being obliged to
abscond from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attributed
those misfortunes to the war which were probably owing to
his own misconduct. An angry creditor took out a commission of
bankruptcy, which was soon superseded, on the petition of
those to whom he was most indebted, who accepted a composi-
tion on his single bond. This he punctually paid, by the
elicits of unwearied diligence; but some of these creditors,
who had been thus satisfied, falling afterwards into distress
themselves, De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claim"
{being then in rising circumstances, in consequence of King
William's favour." On being subsequently reproached by".
Lord Haversham for mercenary conduct, De Foe tells him, in
1705, that, " with a numerous family, and no help but his own
industry, he had forced his way, with undiscouraged diligence,
through a set of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, exclusive
of composition, from seventeen thousand to less than five thou-
sand pounds." It should be remembered that, in those days,
I.u

XVII] MEMO!" OF DE FOE.

our laws against benkrupts were as cruelly oppressive as they
were foolish.

It is certain that Do Foe, whilst under apprehension from
his creditors, resided some time in Bristol. "A friend of
mine in that city," says Mr. Wilson, "informs me that one of
his ancestors remembered De Foe, and sometimes saw him
walking in the streets of Bristol, accoutred in the fashion of
the times, with a. line flowing wig, lace ruffles, and a sword by
his side : also, that he there obtained the name of ' the Sunday
:gcntleman,' because, through fear of the baililis, he did not
dare to appear in public upon any other day."

It appears that at this time De Foo was invited, by some
merchants of his acquaintance residing in Cadiz, to settle in
Spain, with the ot'ier of a good commission. " But," says our
author, "Providence, which had other work for me to do,
placed a secret aversion in my mind to quitting England upon
any account, and made me refuse the best olfer of that kind,
to be concerned with some eminent persons at home, in pro-
posing ways and means to the government for raising money to
supply the occasion of the war, then newly begun." De Foe
suggested a general assessment of personal property, the
amount to be settled by composition, under the inspection of
commissioners appointed by the king. It was, doubtless,
owing to these services, that he was appointed to the ethos of
accountant to the commissioners of the glass duty, in 1690 2
which commission ceased in 1699. It was probably about this
time that Do Foe became secretary to the tile-kiln and brick-
kiln works at 'l'ilbury, in Essex. Pantiles had been hitherto
a Dutch manufacture, and were brought in large quantities to
England. To supersede the necessity of their importation
these works were erected. The speculation ultimately proved
unsuccessful.

Towards the close of the war, in 1696-7, De Foe gave to the
world his " Essay upon Projects : " a work alike admirable for
the novelty of the subject, and the clearness and ingenuity
with which it is treated. The projects of our author may he
claSsod under the heads of politics, commerce, and benevolence
all having reference to the public improvement. The first
relates to banks in general, and to the royal or national bank
in particular, which he. wishes to be render-ml subservient to
the relief of the merchant. and the interests of commerce, as
well as to the purposes of the state; his next project relates to

, .union: or on res. " xix

highways ; a third, to the improvement of the bankrupt laws;
a fourth, to the plan of friendly societies, formed by mutual
assurance, for the relief of the members in seasons of distress ;
a fifth, for the establishment of an asylum for "fools," or,
more properly, " naturals," whom he describes as " a particular
rent-charge on the great family of mankind ; " he next urges
the formation of academies, to supply some neglected branches
of education: one of these was for the improvement of the
English tongue, "to polish and refine it; " and this project
combined a reformation of that " foolish vice," swearing :
another part of the project was an academy for military
studies; and he also suggests an institution for the education
of females.

In January, 1700-1, appeared De Foe's celebrated poem of
" The Trueborn Englishman." It was composed in answer to
" a. vile, abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse, written by one
Mr. Tutchin, and called " The Foreigners," in which the
author--" who he then was I knew not," says De Foe --" fell
personally upon the king and the Dutch nation."

"When I see the town full of lampoons and invectives
against Dutchmen," says De Foe, in his " Explanatory Pre-
face," "only because they are foreigners, and the king re-
proached and insulted by insolent pedants and ballad-making
poets, for employing foreigners, and being a foreigner himself,
I confess myself moved by it to remind our nation of their own
original, thereby to let them see what a banter they put upon
themselves ; since, speaking of Englishmen a!) origine, we are
really all foreigners ourselves." It is to this poem that De-
Foe was indebted for the personal introduction to King

\Villium. He was sent for to the palace by his Majesty;

convened with him, and had repented interviews with him
afterwards. The abilities and sentiments of De Foe appeared
to have made such a favourable impression on the king, that
he ever after regarded him with kindness ; and conceiving
that his talents might be turned to a beneficial account, he
employed him in many secret services, to which our author
alludes occasionally in his writings. The efiect produced upon
the country by the satire was most beneficial. De Foe himself,
near] y thirty years afterwards, writes, " National mistakes,
vulgar errors, and even a general practice, have been reformed
by a just satire. "

In 17004, on the meeting of the fifth parliament of William

13 2 '

gluing. . .
III., we find De Foe strenuously engaged in advocating the
necessity of settling the succession in the Protestant line ; an
important object with William, as the only means of perpe--
tuating the benefits which the nation had reaped from the Revo-
lution. To this great end De Foe devoted all his energies,
labouring with unwearied zeal in the cause. His conduct on i
the imprisonment of the Kentish gentlemen, is hose names are
historically associated with the presentation of the famous
Kentish petition, was marked with all the intrepidity of his
character. The Commons had imprisoned the petitioners,
who had prayed the House for the settlement of the Protestant
Succession, for having presented a. petition " scandalous, inso-
lent, and seditious." On this, De Foe drew up his celebrated
" legion Paper." In what manner it was communicated to
the House does not appear upon the journals. lt was reported
at the time that De Foe, disguised as a woman, prosentt d it
to the Speaker as he entered the House of Commons. The
" Legion " petition rang like a tocsin throughout the kingdom.
As, however, the author remained concealed, the Commons did
not think [it to pass any particular censure upon it. The
Kent-ish petitioners were. discharged by the prorogation of
parliament on the 24111 of June; they were subsequently
feasted at Moreors' Hall. on which occasion De Foe attended.

By the death of King \Villiam our author lost a kind friend
and powerful protector. Toward the latter part of this
reign, De Foe took up his abode at Hackney, and resided
there many years. Ii ere some of his children were born and
buried. In the parish register is the following entry :--
"Sophia, daughter to Daniel De Foe, by Mary his wife, was
baptized, December 24, 1701."

- His next important work--a work that exercised great influ-
ence on his fortunes---was the " Shortest Way with the Dissent-
ers; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church ; 17 02."
Li this the author, assuming the character of an Ultra High
Churchman, advocates in an artful veil of irony the adoption of
the severest measures against the Dissent-en's. The arguments
he put forth found high favour with both the Universities.
The High Church Party never suspected the sincerity of their
partizan ; and charmed and won by the fierce doctrines of their
champion, were unsuspicious of the satire of their extrava-
gance. It was, however, De Foes hard fate to bo mis-
understood bv both parties. Whilst the High Churchmenmom or D}: For. xxi

the Dissenters treated him as a real enemy. The Church
Party, however, fell into the trap laid for them by De Foe;
for, by expressing their delight at the fiery sentiments of the
writer they avowed them as their own true feelings on the
question. The first detection of our author is said to have
been owing to the industry of the Earl of Nottingham, one of

\the secretaries of state. When his name was actually known,
ipeople were at no loss to decipher his object; and those who
had committed themselves by launching forth in his praises
were stung with madness at their own folly. It was at once
resolved by the party in power to crush De Foe by a state
prosecution. In the height of the storm, our author sought
concealment ; when a. proclamation was issued by the Govern-
ment, oliering 501. for the discovery of his retreat; and in the
House of Commons, it was resolved that the book " be burnt
by the hands of the common hangman in Palace Yard." On
the printer of the work and the bookseller being taken into
custody, De Foe issued forth from his retirement, resolved, as
he expressed it, " to throw himself upon the favour of
Government, rather than others should be ruined by his
mistake." He was indicted at the Old Bailey Sessions, on the
24th of February, 1703, and proceeded to trial in the following
July. It may be gathered from his own account of the prose--
cution, that when his enemies had him in their power, they
were at a. loss to know what to do with him. He was there-
fore advised to throw himself on the mercy of the Queen, with
a promise of protection; which induced him to quit his defence
and acknowledge himself the author of the ofiensive work.
On this he was sentenced to pay a fine of 200 marks to the
Queen; to stand three times in the pillory; to beimprisoned'.
during the Queen's pleasure, and to find sureties for his good

- behaviour for seven years. The people, however, were with
De Foe. Hence, he was guarded to the pillory by the populace;
and descended from it with the triumphant aeclamations of the
surrounding multitude. He has himself related, that "the
people, who were expected to treat him very ill, on the com
trary, pitied him, and wished those who set him there were
placed in his room, and expressed their affections by loud
shouts and acclamations when he was taken down." Thus, the
odium intended for De Foe recoiled on his persecutors, and
the pillory became to him a place of hone .xxii nnuom or on row.

A triumphant evidence of the high spirit of De Foe is
manifested by the fact, that on the very day of his exhi-
hition to the people, he published " A Hymn to the
I'illory ! "

De Foe's fortunes were now at their lowest ebb : being a. pri-
soner, moreover, he could no longer attend to his pantile works,
his only reumining source of revenue, and they were conse-
quently given up. By this ufiair he lost, as he himself informs '
us, 3,5001. ; and he had now a. wife and six children dependent '
upon him, with no other resource for their support than the
product of his pen. Hence the leisure of De Foe, whilst in
Newgate, was not that of idleness or dissipation. It was then
be stored his mind with those facts relative to the habits and
pursuits of the prisoners, which he has detailed with so much
truth to nature, as well as interest. - A great part of his time
was also devoted to the composition of various minor political
works. It was likewise whilst in Newgate that he projected
his " Review," a periodical work of four quarto pages, which
was published for nine successive years without intermission,
and during the greater part of the time, three times a. week,
without his having received any assistance whatever in its
production. Throughout this work, he carried on an unspar-
ing warfare against folly and vice in all their disguises :
it pointed the way to the " Tatlers," " Spectators," and
" Guardians," and may be referred to as containing a great
mass of interesting and valuable matter, written with all the
author's characteristic spirit and vigour.

The Tories vainly endeavoured to buy up De Foe: but
Newgate had no terrors for him, and he continued at once
their prisoner and their assailant. Upon the accession of Mr.
Harley to oflice, his own politics not being dissimilar to those
of our author, the minister made a private communication to;
him, with the view of obtaining his support. No immediate
arrangement, however, took place between them, as De Foo
remained a prisoner some months afterwards. N otwithstand-
ing, it is most likely that the Queen became acquainted with
De Foe's real merits through the medium of the minister, and
was made conscious of the injustice of our author's sufferings,
which she now appeared desirous to mitigate. For this
purpose, she sent money to his wife and family, at the same
time transmitting to him a sufficient sum for the payment of
his fine, and the expenses attending his discharge from prison.MEMOIR or m: roe. Xxill.

On his release from Newgate, De Foe retired to Bury St.
Edmunds. Party clamour, and party malice, however, pur-
sued him there. On the miserable libels issued at this time
against him, he says, "I tried retirement, and banished my-
self from the town : but neither a country recess, any more
than a stone doublet, can secure a man from the clamour of,
the pen." -,

In 1705 De Foe was employed by Harley and Godolphin on'
various missions of a secret and, it is said, of even a dangerous!
nature, one of which required his presence upon the Conti-
nent. Harley seems to have been so well satisfied, that upon
De Foe's return, he rewarded him with an appointment at
home. In 1706, De Foe wrote voluminously on the subject
of the union with Scotland, which measure he strenuously
advocated. This advocacy obtained for him a confidential
mission to Scotland, where he was received with great con-
sideration. While in Edinburgh, he published his "Cale-
donia," &c., a poem in honour of Scotland and the Scots
nation. In 1708, De Foe was rewarded with an appoint
ment and a fixed salary. When the Union was completed,
he published "The Union of Great Britain." In 1710, he
went to live at Stoke Newington, where he resided for some
years, and appears to have been comfortable in his circum-
stances. In 1712 was closed the last volume of the " Review."
In a long preface to this volume, De Foe has a most eloquent
defence of this work, and of the mode in which he had con-
ducted it. Nothing can be finer, more manly, or more con-
clusive. In allusion to his sufierings during the progress of
the work, he says, " I have gone through a life of wonders,
and am the subject of a vast variety of providences; I have
been fed more by miracle than Elijah when the ravens were

his purveyors. I have some time ago summed up my life i1
this distich--

" No man has tasted difl'ering fortunes more,
- And thirteen times I have been rich and poor."

This preface may be considered as a review,--a summing up

of the events of De Foe's political life, and assuch it possesses

high value for the noble spirit of conscious truth that ani-

mates every line of it. As a piece of English, it is remarkable

flor its innate strength, as well as for the simplicity of its
iction.xxiv armors or me roe"

Our author was again unlucky enough to be committed to
Newgate, on the absurd charge of writing libels in favour of
the Pretender. After the death of Queen Anne, De Foe, who
had been a political writer for thirty years, retired from the
thorny field to the more pleasant paths of literature. Whilst
writing " An Appeal to Honour and J ustice," he was struck
with apoplexy ; he however recovered, and in the early part
of 171-5, committed to the press one of his most useful
treatises, " The Family Instructor." The success of this
subsequently induced him to write his "Religious Comt-
ship," which, on its appearance in 1722, met with equal
favour.

In 1719 appeared the immorta "Robinson Crusoe." Nearly
the whole circle of booksellers had in vain been canvassed for
a publisher. \Villiam Taylor, the fortunate speculator, is
said to have cleared a thousand pounds by the book, which
rose into immediate popularity. There can be no doubt that
the idea of the work was first suggested to the author by the
story of Alexander Selkirk, which had been given to the
public seven years before. " It has been thought by some,"
says Mr. John Ballantyne, in his biographical sketch prefixed
to the Edinburgh edition of Do Fee's novels, " to detract from
the merit of De Foe, that the idea was not originally his own,
but really the story of Selkirk, which had been published a
few years before, in VVoodes Rogers' Voyage rouml tile Il'orld,
appears to have furnished our author with so little beyond the
bare idea of a man living upon an uninhabited island, that it
appears quite immaterial whether he took his hint from that
or from any other similar story, of which many were then
current." In a number of "The Englishman," Steele gave
the true and particular history of Selkirk. The place in which
"Robinson Crusoe" was composed has been variously con-
tested. It seems most probable (says Mr. Wilson) that De
Foe wrote it in his retirement in Stoke Newington, in a large
white house, rebuilt by himself, and still standing in Church-
street. The work has been printed in almost every written
language, and has been the delight of men of all creeds and
all distinctions.

" Robinson Crusoe" was speedily followed by the " Account
of Dickory Creel-19;" the "Life and Piracies of Captain
Singleton; " the " History of Duncan Campbell : " the
"Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders; " the " Life of
Colonel Jack 3 " the " Memoirs of a Cavalier; " and that
extraordinary work, the "Account of the Plague."

The latter years of De Foe's life must have been those of

. competence, insured to him by the success of his works. But
this period of his life was embittered by the cruelty and un-

l dutifulness of his son, who, to quote the words of De Foe, from

. a letter written in his anguish, " has both mined my family
and broken my heart."

For some years before his death, De Foe suffered greatly
from both the gout and the stone, which diseases were occa-
sioned, in part, most probably by his close application to
study, whilst accumulating stores of knowledge for the benefit
of his fellow-men. He expired on the 24th of April, 1731,
when he was about seventy years of age. The parish of St.
Giles, Cripplegate, in which he drew his first breath, was also
destined to receive his last. He was buried from thence, on
the 26th of April, in Tindall's burial-ground, now most known
by the name of Bunhill Fields. He left six children, two
sons and four daughters. His wife died at the latter end of
the following year. Agreat--graudson of De Foe was living
in 1856, in a state of poverty, at the age of seventyveight,
for whose benefit a small fund had not long before been
raised.

The character of De Foe was but the practical example of
his best writings. As a citizen of the world, his love of truth,
and the patience, the cheerfulness, with which he endured the
obloquy and persecution of his enemies, endear him to us as a
great working benefactor to his race. His memory is en-
shrined with the memories of those who make steadfast our
faith in the nobility and goodness of human nature. As a
writer, De Foe has bequeathed to us imperishable stores of
wisdom. If he paint vice, it is to show its hideousness; whilst
virtue itself receives a new attraction at his hands. He was
not a poet, but he could write vigorous verse, and his satire
was bold and trenchant, as well as convincing by its terseness,
and by the unadorned eloquence of its truth. De Fee's prose,
though occasionally careless, is remarkable for its simplicity
and strength. What he has to say, he says in the plainest
manner, and in the simplest style. He does not--as is the
vice of our day--hide his thoughts under a glittering phraseo-
logy, but uses words as the pictures of things. It is owing
to this happy faculty, this unforced power, that De Foexxvi MEMO"! or m: FOE.

occasionally rises, as in many instances in the golden volume
now offered to the reader, almost to the sublime. In his picture
of the despair of Crusoe, we have, in words intelligible even to
infancy, a wondrous delineation of the soul of man in a. most
trying and most terrible hour. But the crowning merit of De
Foe is, that he was, in the right sense of the term, both in
his [flannel conduct, and the spirit of his writings,

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a
good estate by merchandise, and leaving 0E his trade, lived
afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother,
whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in
that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutz-
naer ; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we
are now called~nay, we call ourselves, and write our name,
Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in'Flanders, formerly
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed'
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What
became of my second brother I never knew, any more than
my father or mother knew what became of me.

.Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a
competent share of learning, as far as houseeducation and a
country free-school generally go, and designed me for the
law ; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, ~2S Ln-'r _\.\n .wvrxrenas

nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties
and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there
seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of natuie.
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave. man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against- what he foresaw was my design. Ile
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me
upon this subject. He. asked me what reasons, more than n.
more wandering inclination, 1 had for leaving,' my father's
house and my native country. where I might be well intro-
duced, and had :i- prospect of raising my fortune by applica-
tion and industry, with a. life of ease and pleasure. Ilo told
me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, )r of
aspiring. superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad
upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ;
that these things were all either too far above me, or too far
below me ; that- mine was the middle state, or what might bu
called the upper station of low life. which he had found, by
long experience, was the best state in the world, the most
suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and sufferings, of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury. mnbi~
tion, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I
might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing.
viz, that this was the state of life which all other people
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequence of being born to great things, and wished they
had been placed in the middle of the two extremes. between
the mean and the great : that the wise man gave his testimony
to this. as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.

Il'e bade. me. observe it, and I should always find that the
calan'iities of life were shared among the upper and lower part.
of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest
disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the
higher or lower part. of mankind; nay, they were not sulr
jected to so many distempers, and uneasiness, either of body
or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and
extravagances on one hand. or by hard labour, want of neces-
saries and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bringor nonmsox envson 39

 

CRUSOS'B FATHER ENTREKIS I")! TO STAY AT BONE
distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of
their way of living; that the middle station of life was
calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoyments;
that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle for>>
tune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the
blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way
men went silently and smoothly through the world, and com-
fortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the
hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily
bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob
the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the
passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for
great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning
by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec-
tionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate
myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I
was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was
under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station
of life which he had just been recommending to me ; and that
if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be
my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he
should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfor
tunes as to give me any encouragement to go away ; and to
close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example
to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep
.him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not
prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me,
and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in
my l't'uovel'v.or noemsoN causes. 31

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know
it to be so himself--I say, I observed the tears run down his
face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother
who was killed; and that when he spoke of my having
leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved
that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was
so full he could say no more to me.

I was sincerely afiected with this discourse, and, indeed,
who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of
going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to
my father's desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off ;
and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further im-
portunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite
away from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily
as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my
mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant
than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so
entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never
settle to anything with resolution enough to go through
with it, and my father had better give me his consent than
force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years
old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if

she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad;

if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no
more ; and I would promise, by a double diligence to recover
the time that I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject ; that he knew too well what was my interest
to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and
that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after
the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me;
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help
for me; but I might depend I should never have their con--
sent to it ; that for her part, she would not have so much hand
in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that
my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, >
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
to her, with a sigh : " That boy might be happy if he would
stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the meat
miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent
to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated
with my father and mother about their being so positively
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually,
and without any purpose of making an elopement at that
time ; but, I say, being there, and one of my companions
being about to sail to London in his father's ship, and prompt-
ing me to go with them with the common allurement of sea-
faring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I
consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much
as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as
they might, without asking God's blessing or my father's,
without my consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour. God knows, on the lst of September, 165],
I went on board a. ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or con-
tinued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner out of
the Humber, than the wind began to blow and the sea to
rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at
sea before, I was mOst inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified
in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had
lime, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandon-
ing my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father's
tears and my mother's entreaties, came new fresh into my
mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with
the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God
and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since;
no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to
allect me then, who was br" a young sailor, and had never
known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down.
as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we
should never rise more 3' in this agony of mind, I made many
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare
my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon
dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived ; that I would take
his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these
any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observa-
tions about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfort-
ably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed
to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore ; and I resolved
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to he a
little inured to it: however, I was very grave let all that
day, being also a litt'e sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and
rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and
a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw. ,

. I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and
so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest my good
resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed
me away, comes to me: "Well, Bo ," says he, clapping me
upon the shoulder, " how do you do after it? I warrant you
were frighted, wer'n't you, last night, when it blew but a
capful of wind 2 " " A. capful d'you call it 2 " said I ; "'twas
a terrible storm." "A storm, you fool you," replies he ; " do
you call that a storm'! why, it was nothing at all; give us
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such
a squall of wind as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget
all that ; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis new? " To

' make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all

seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the busi-

ness of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his

cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, severe"

times, " Lerd, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we

shall be all undone!" and the like. During these first
' c i''36 mm m mvzmuans '

hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the
stoerage, and cannot describe my temper : I could ill resume
the first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon,

and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of
death had been past ; and that this would be nothing like the
first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just

now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted.i
I got up out of my cabin and looked out ; but such a dismal;
sight [ never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke,
up)" us every three or four minutes ; when I could look
about, I could see nothing but distress round us; two ships

th it rode near us, we found, htd cut their masts by the board,

being deep laden; and our men cried out, that a ship which
rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more
ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the
Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much

labouring in the sea 3 but two or three of them drove, and

came close by use, running away with only their spritsail out

before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master
of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was
very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him,
that if he did not the ship would founder, he consented ; and
when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut
that away also, and make a. clear deck.

Any one must judge what a condition I must be in at all
this. who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a
fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this
distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
1-1. .1 fold more horror of mind upon account of my former con-
victions, and the having returned from them to the resolu-
tions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself ;
mid these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such
a condition, thit I can by no words describe it. But the
worst- was not come yet ; the storm continued with such fury,
that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen
a name. We bed a good ship, but she was deep laden, and
\\'.lll0W8'-'l in the see, so that tho seamen every new and then
n.~ied out she would founder. It was my advantage in one
)'csp'cct that I did not know what they meant by founder, till
.4
- ~<<..~!~L.~

I inquired. However the storm was so violent, that I saw,
what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some
others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and
expecting every moment when the ship would go to the
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest
of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see,
cried out we had sprung a leak; another said, there was four
feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within
me: and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I
sat, into the cabin. However, the men mused me, and told
me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well
able to pump as another; at which I stirred up, and went to
the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing,
the master seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip, and run away to the sea,
and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal
of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought
- the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. cIn
a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon.
As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think
of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside
with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; and it was
a great while before I came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm began to abate a little, yet it was not possible she could
swim till we might run into any rt,- so the master con-
tinued firing guns for help; and a ight shi , whohad rid it
out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to elp us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was!
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie?
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast
them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered
it out a great length, which they, after much labour and
hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our
stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for
them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of 1eaching
thei1 own ship p, so all agreed to let her drive, and only to
pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our.3.' LII-I no .mvizxri-in-ts or ul'uax'sox i'lit'sul-'L.

with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed
unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape,
could have pushed me forward against the ca] 1 reasonings
and persuasions of my most retired thought:, and against
two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first
attempt. .

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who
was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first
time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town
to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it ap-
peared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his
father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a
trial, in order to go farther abroad : his father, turning to me
With a very grave and concerned tone, " Young man," says
he, " you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to
take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be
a seafaring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to see.
.no more i " " That is another case," said he; "it is my
calling, and therefore my duty ; but as you made this voyage
for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what
you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallen
us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,"
continues he, "what are you ; and on what account did you
go to sea 'l " Upon that I told him some of my story; at the
end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion:
" What had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my ship? I would not set my footin the
same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This indeed
was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet
agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could
have authority to go. However, he afterwards talked very
gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me. "And, young man," said he.
" depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go,
you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments,
till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more; which way he went I knew not. As for
me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London
by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
\ll'ered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
how 1 should he laughed at among the neighbours. and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even

Ieverybody else; from whence I have since often observed,
.how incongruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, via, that they are not ashamed to
sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be
esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, ""601"
tain what measures to take, and what course of life. to load.
An irresistible reluctance continued to going home 3. and as I
stayed awhile, the remembranee of the distress I had been in
were ofl' ; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to return wore oil' with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house,>> which hurried me into the wild and indigestod
notion of raising my fortune, and that impressed those
conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good
advice, and to the entreaties and even the commands of my
father ;-~-I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my View; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa ; or, as
our sailors vulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I
did not ship myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed
have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same
time I should have learnt the duty and ofiice of a fore-mast
man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in
my pocket and good clothes upon my back, I would always go
on board in the habit of a. gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, nor learned to do any.

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and mis-- '
guided young fellows as I then was ; the devil generally not

omitting to lay some snare for them very early; but it was

not so with me. I first got acquainted with the master of a

ship who had been on the coast of Guinea ; and who, having

had very good success there, was resolved to go again. This

captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at

all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to'
s e the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I

should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his

companion ; and if I could carry anything with me, I should

have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and

perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.

I embraced the ofi'er ; and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I
went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure
with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the
captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about
PS40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
These PS40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some
of my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I
believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute
so much as that to my first adventure. '-

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful
in all my adventures, which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also I got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of
navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some
things that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as
he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; and,
in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and amcrchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost PS300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin. I

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; par-
ticularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a
violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our
principal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of
' teen degrees north even to the line itself.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved
to go the some voyage again, and I embarked in the some
vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and
bid now got the command of the ship. This was the unhap-
piest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did not carry
quite PS100 of my new-gained wealth, so that 1 had PS200
-left, which I had lodged with my friend's widow, who was
very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes : the first
was this--our ship making her course towards the Canary
Islands, or rather between those Islands and the African
shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish
rover of Sellee, who gave chose to us with all the sail she
could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards
would spread, or our masts carry to get clear ; but finding the
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us
in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship having twelve
guns. and the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon
he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwlu't
our quarter, instead of athwart our stem, as he intended, we
brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in
e. broadside upon him. which made him sheer 0E again, after
returning our fire, and pouring in also his small shot from
near two hundred men which he had on board. However, we
had not a. man touched, all our men keeping close. He pre-
pared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves. But
laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he
entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to
cutting and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them
with small shot, half-pikes, powder--chests. and such like, and
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this
melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and _
three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged '
to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port
'belonging to the Moors.

l The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended; nor was I carried up the country to the
emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept
by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made his
slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business. At
this surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant
to a. miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now
I looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me,
that I should be miserable and have none to relieve me,
which I thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that
I could not be worse; for now the hand of Heaven had over-
taken me, and I was undone without redemption; but, alas]
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when '
he went to sea again, believing that it would some time or -
other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-
of'war; and. that then I should be set at liberty. But this
hope of mine was soon taken away ; for when he went to sea,
he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to efi'ect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it ; nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that
would embark with me--no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman, there but myself; so that for two
years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination,
yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in
practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my
liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home longer
than usual without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was
for want of money, he used, constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing ; and, as he always
took me and young Maresco with him to row the boat. we
:made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching
lfish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,
' one of his kinsmen, and the youth--the Maresco, as they called
him--to catch a. dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning,
a fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from
the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither
or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next night;
and when the morning come, we found we had pulled OR to
sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at
least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well in
again, though with a. great deal of labour and some danger ;
for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but
we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
_more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the long-boat of our English ship that he had taken, he
resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a com-
pass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his
ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little state-
room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a
barge, with a. place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home
the main-sheet ; and room before for a. hand or two to stand
and work the sails. She smiled with what we call a. shoulder-
of--mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to
lie, with a. slave or two, and a. table to out on, with some
small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he
thought fit to drink; and his bread, rice, and cofiee.

'We went frequently out with his boat a'fishing; and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with-
out me It happened that he had appointed to go out in this
boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors
of some distinction in that place, and for whom he had pro-
vided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the
boat over~night a. larger store of provisions than ordinary;
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder
and shot, which were on board his ship, for that they designed
some sport of fowling as well as fishing. 1

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and
pendants out, and everything to accommodate his guests;
when by-and-by my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put oilE going, from some business that fell'
out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go'
out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his
friends were to sup at his house, and commanded that as soon
as I got some fish I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do.

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now 1 found I was likely to have 9. little
ship at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared
to furnish myself, not for tie ' g business, but for a voyage;
though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither
I should steer--anywhere to get out of that place was my desire.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board ; for
I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread.
He said that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk
or biscuit, and three jars of fresh water, into the boat. I
.knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was
evident, by the make, were taken out of some English prize,
and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on
shore, as if they had been there before for our master. I
conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine
or thread, a. hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were
of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make
candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he inno-
cently came into also: his name was Ismael, which they
call Muley, or Moely ; so I called to him :--" Moely," said I,
"our patron's-guns are on board the boat ; can you not get
a little powder and shot? It may be we may kill some
alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says he,
"I'll bring some;" and accordingly he brought a. great
leather pouch, which held a pound and ahalf of powder, or
rather more; and another with shot, that had five or six
pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat. At the
same time, I had found some powder of my master's in the
great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the
case, which was almost empt , pouring what was in it into
another; and thus furnishe with everything needful, we
sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the
entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice
of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before
we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind
blew from the N. RE, which was contrary to my desire, for
bad it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the
coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but
my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be

gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest
to fate.
After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for
when I had fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that
he might not see them, I said to the Moor, "This will not
do; our muster will not be thus served; we must stand
farther o 1" He, thinking no harm, agreed, and, being in
the head of the boat, set the sails; and, us I had the helm, I
ran the boat out near a. league farther, and then brought her
to, as if I would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I
stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise
with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard
into the see. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork,
and called to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go
all over the world with me. He Swarm so strong after the
boat, that he would have reached me very quickly, there being
but little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and.
fetching one of the fouling-pieces, I presented it at him, and
told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I
would do him none: "But," said I, "you swim well enough
to reach to the shore, and the seat is calm ; make the best of
your way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you
come near the boat I'll shoot you through the head, for I am
resolvad to have my liberty ; " so he turned himself about,
and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached
it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I 'could have been content to have taken this Moor with
me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to
trust him. \Vhen he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom
they called Xury, and said to him, "Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a. great man ; but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear by
Muhomet and his father's heard, "I must throw you into'
the see. too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so
'innooently, that I could not distrust him, and swore to be
finithful to me, and go all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the bout, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards. the
Straits' mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits
must have been supposed to do) : for who would have supposed
we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian
coast, where whole notions of Negroes were sure to surround
us with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could not go
on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or
more merciless savages of human kind.

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little towards the cast, that I might keep in with the
shore: and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth,
quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day, at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, ]
,could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of
Sallee: quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or
indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and
the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands,
that I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor;
the wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner
five days; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I
concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me,
they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river,
I knew not what. nor where, neither what latitude, what
country, what nation, or what river. I neither saw, nor
desired to see any people; the principal thing I wanted
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and dis-
cover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, rearing, and howling of
wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy
was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on
shore till day. "Well, Xury," said I, " then I won't ; but
it may be that we may see men by day, who will he as bad to
us as those lions." "Then we give them the shoot glm,"-.;
says Xury, laughing, "make them run wey." Such Englishl
Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However, I was =
glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out
of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all,
Xury's advice was good, and I took it: we dropped our little
anchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none;
for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we
knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the
sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.

Xui'y was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more frighted when we heard one of these
mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat ; we could
not, see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a.

 

XURY SWEAY'S TO RV. FAITUF'FL

monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for Might I know; but poor Xui'y cried
to me to weigh the anchor and row away: "No," says I,
"Xury; we can slip out cable, with the buoy to it, and go
off to sea. ; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said
so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within
two oars' length, which something surprised me 3 however, Ior ROBINSON causes. 51

immediately stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun,
fired at him; upon which he immediately turned about, and
swam towards the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and
hideous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well upon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon the
noise or report of the gun, a thing I have some reasbn to
believe these creatures had never heard before: this con-
vinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night
on that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was
another question too; for to have fallen into the hands of
any of tho savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
hands of the lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat ; when and where to get to it was the point. Xiu-y said,
if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would
find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked
him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in
the hoat'l The boy answered with so much afiection, as made
me love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they
eat me, you go wey." "Well, Xury," said I, "we will both
go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall
eat neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to
eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles which I
mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the
shore as we thought was proper, and so waded on shore;
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy
seeing a low place about a. mile up the country, rambled to it,
and by-and-by I saw him come running towards me. I
thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forwards towards him to help
him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hang-
ing over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had
shot, like o. hare, but difierent in colour, and longer legs:
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that 'poor Xury came with, was to tell me he
had found good water, and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains

D 2
for water, for a little higher up the creek where We were we
found the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but
a. little way up; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare
we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no
footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very
well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
islands also, lay not far 01f from the coast. But as I had no
instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least remembering,
what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea. towards them; otherwise
I might now easily have found some of these islands. But
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to
that part where the English traded, I should find some of
their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would
relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was
must be that country which, lying between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste and unin-
habited, except by wild beasts ; the Negroes having abandoned
it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors ; and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barren-
ness ; and, indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious
number of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures
which harbour there ; so that the Moors use it for their hunt-
ing only, where they go like an army, two or three thousand
men at a time : and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together
upon this coast we saw nothing but a. waste uninhabited
country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and rearing
of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico of
Teneriffe, being the high t0p of the Mountain Tenerifi'e in the
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the see. also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep
along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place ; and once in particular, being early in
the morning, we came tonn anchor under a. little point of land,
which was pretty high ; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay
still to go farther in. Katy, whose eyes were more about him
that it seemsmine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that
we had best go farther off the shore; " for," says he, " look,
yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast
asleep." I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that lay on
the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill
that hung as it were a little over him. " Xury," says I, " you
shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and
said, " Me killl he eat me at one mouth ! " one mouthful
he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him
lie still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket
bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
two slugs, and laid it down ; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets ; and the third (for we had three pieces)
I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I
could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he
lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose that the slugs
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started
up, growling at first, but finding his leg broken, fell down
again; and then got up upon three legs, and gave the most
hideous roar that ever I heard. 1 was a little surprised that
I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up the second -
piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired
again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see
him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life.
Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on
shore. "Well, go," said I : so the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the muzzle
of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which
despatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food ; and I
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury
said he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. " For what, Xury 2 " said
I. "Me cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could
not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with
him, and it was a monstrous great one.

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might, one way or other, he of some value to us ; and I3.1. . Lil-'1: AND Auvmrrcnrzs

resolved to take of? his skin if I could. So Xury and I went
to work with him _: but Xury was much the better workman
at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us
both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him,
and spreading it. on the top of our cabin, tho sun etfectunlly
dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie
'. n son.
1After this stol', we made on to the southward continually
"for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions,
which began to abate very much, and going no olt-ener to tho
' shore than we were obliged to for ircsh water. My design in
this was, to make the llircr Gambia. or Senegal, that is to say,
anywhere about. the (Expo do. Vol-Ll, where I was in hopes in
nuzct with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not
what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or
perish {hero among the Nogroes. I knew that all the ships
from Europe, which sziilcd either to the coast of (.luinczt or to
Brazil, or to the East- Indies. made this Cape, or those islands ;
and, in :1. word, 1 put- the whole of my fortune upon this single
point, either that>> I must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When .I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have swid, I began to soc that the. land was inhabited ;
and in two or three plucvs, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive
they were quite black, and naked. I was once inclined to
have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better couu.
seller, and said to me, " No go, no go." However, I hauled
in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I found
they run along the shore by mo 3 good way. I observed they
had no weapons in their hand, except one, who had a long
slender stick, which Xury said was a. lance, and that they
could throw them :1 great- wny with good aim ; so I kcpt at a
distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could;
ulLl particularly made signs for something to eat ; they
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me
some meat. Upon this, I lowcrml the top of my sail. and lay
by, and two of them ran up into the country. and in less than
half an hour czune back, and brought with them two picccs of
dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither know what the one or the other
was : however, we were willing to accept it, but how to come
at it was our ncxt dispute, for I would not venture on shore
to them, and they were as much afraid of us : but they took
a. safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid
it down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it
on board, and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends: but an opportunity offered that very
instant to oblige them wonderfully: for while we were lying
by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the
other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains
towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, .
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,
any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange,
but I believe it was the latter; because, in the first place,
those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and,
in the second place, we found the people terribly frighted,
especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart
did not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water, they did not oiier to fell
upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea
and swam about, as if they had come for their diversion : at
last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I
expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun
with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired,
and shot him directly in the head : immediately he sank dov'vn
into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down,
as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was : be im-
mediately made to the shore; but between the wound, which
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun; some of them were
even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the
very terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk
in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for the
creature. I found him by his blood staining the water: and
by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that
it Was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable
degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration,
to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
'noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at that
distance, know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes
wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a. favour from me; which, when I made
signs to them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him ; and
though they had no knife, yet, with a. sharpened piece of
wood, they took ofi his skin as readily, and much more readily,
than we could have done with a. knife. They offered me some
of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would give
it them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
provisions, which, though I did not understand, yet I
accepted. I then made signs to them for some water, and
held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward,
to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and
there came two women, and brought a great vessel made of
earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun; this they set
down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my
jars, and filled them all three. The women were as naked as
the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward
for about eleven days more, without offering to go near the
shore, till 1 sow the land run out a great length into the sea,
"at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; and
the sen. being very calm, I kept a large offing to make this
point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues
from the land, 1 saw plainly land on the other side, to sen-i
ward: then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that'
this was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands called, from!
thence, Cape do Verd Islands. However, they were at a
great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to
do; for if I should be taken with a. fresh of wind, I might
neither reach one or other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat down, Xury having the helm; when, on a.
sudden, the boy cried out, " Master, master, 9. ship with a.
wilt" and the foolish boy was frightcd out of his wits,
thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only
the ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for Negroes.
But, when I observed the course she steered, I was soon
convinced they were bound some other way, and did not
design to come any nearer to the shore: upon whish I
stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them if possible.

: With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by
before I could make any signal to them: but after I had
crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems,
saw, by the help of their glasses, that it was some European
boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship that was
lost 5 so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was
encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on
board, I made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress,
and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon
these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me;
and in about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but, at last,'
a Scotch sailor, who was on board, called to me: and I
answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had
made my escape out of slavery from the Moore, at Sallee;
they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me
in, and all my goods.

A. it was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from.

' such a miserable and almost hopeless condition as I was in";

and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship,

as a. return for my deliverance; but he generously told
me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I had
should be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Bmzils.

"For," says he, " I have saved your life on no other terms

than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one

time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition.

Besides," said he, " when I carry you to the Brazils, so great

a way from yourown countr , if I should take from you what58 1.er AND Anvnnrvnns

you have, you will be starved there, and than I only take
away that life I have given. No, no," says he: "Seignor
Inglese" (Mr. Englishman), "I will carry you thither in
charity, and those things will help to buy your subsistence
there, and your passage home again."

 

CIH'SUE XS TAKEN L'l' l5\' 4' PORTUGUESE VESSEL.

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance to :1. tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that
none should touch anything that I had: then he took every--
thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact
inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my
three earthen jars.

As to my beat, it was a very good one; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for his ship's use; and
aSked me what I would have for it? I told him, he had been
so generous to me in everything, that I could not oEer to
make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him : upon
which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came
there, if any one offered to give more, he would make it up.
He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy
Xury, which I was loath to take; not that I was unwilling
to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the
poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in pro-
curing my own. However, when I let him know my reason,
he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he
would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years,
if he turned Christian: upon this, and Xury saying he was
willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.

W'e had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived
in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in ab :ut
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what
to do next with myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I am never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my-
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and
forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to
me ; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me, such as
the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump
of bees'-wax--for I had made candles of the rest: in a word,
I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all
my cargo; and with this stock, I went on shore in the
Brazils.

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the
house of a good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio,
as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugarvhouse). I
lived with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that
means, with the manner of planting and making of sugar;
and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they get
rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle
there, I would turn planter among them; resolving, in the
meantime, to find out some way to get my money, which ]
had left in London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting
a kind of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land
that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a.
plan for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was "Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbour, because
his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than anything else, for about two
years. However, we began to increase, and our land be
to come into order; so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready
for planting canes in the year to come. But we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong
in parting with my boy Xury. .

But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no remedy but to go on : I had got into
an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly con-
trary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good advice. Nay,
'I was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of
low life, which my father advised me to before, and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world, as I had done;
and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as
well in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand,
miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness.
and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the .
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour ; no work to be done, but by the labour
of my hands; and Insed to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himsel . But how just has it been--and how should all meni
reflect, that when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
oxcnange, and be convinced of their former felicity by their
' experience--I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary
:life I reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be
'my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life
which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the
ship that took me up at sea, went back--for the ship re-
mained there, in providing his lading, and. preparing for his
voyage, nearly three months; when, telling him what little
stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this
friendly and sincere advice :--" Seignor Inglcse," says he
(for so he always called me), "if you will give me letters,
and a procuration in form to me, with orders to the person
who has your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon,
to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are
proper for this country, I will bring you the produce of them,
God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are all
subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say"
is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so'
that, if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way,
and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have
recourse to for your supply.' '

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
I could not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain, as he desired.

. I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all .

. my adventures--my slavery, escape, and how I had met with J

,tho Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, 1
and what condition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply ; and when this honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant at London, who represented it effec-
tually to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money,
but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portugal captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity to me

. The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in62 m FE axn anvzmwns

hnglish goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to mo
to the Bmzils; among which, without my direction (for I was
too young in my business to think of them), he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and utensils, necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made, for I
was surprised with the joy of it 3 and my good steward, the
captain, had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had
sent him for a present for himself, to purchase and bring me
over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and would
not accept of any consid "ation, except a little tobacco, which
I would have him accept, being of my own produce.

Ngither was this all g for my goods being all English
manufacture, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particu-
larly valuable and desirable in the country, I found means
to sell them to a. very great advantage ; so that I might say,
I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour--I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I
bought me a negro slave, and an European servant also--I
mean another besides that which the captain brought me
from Lisbon.

tut as. abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the
next year with great success in my plantation : I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours; and these
fifty rolls, being eat-7'. of above a hundred weight, were well
cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon :
and now increasing in business and in wealth, my head began
to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach;
such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in busi-
ness. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallon me, for
which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired
life, and of which he had so sensibly described the middle
station of life to be full of; but other things attended me,
and 1 was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries ;
and particularly, to increase my fault, and double the reflec-
tions upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make, all these miscarriages \'.'(l'(| procured by my
apparent obstinate adhcrii _- to my foolish inclination of
wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in contra
diction to the clearest views 3f doing myself good in a fair
and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of
life, which nature and Providence concurred to prcrent me
with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go and
leave the happy View I had of being a rich and t; riving man
in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate
desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted ;
and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gal. of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be
consistent with life, and a statc of health in the world.

To come, then, by the just degrees, to the particulars of
this part of my story :--Yoa may suppose, that having now
lived almost four years in th-_ Brazils, and beginning to thrive
and prosper verywell upon my plantation, I had not only
learned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in
my discourses among them, I had frequently given them an
account of my two '.'oyages to the coast of Guinea; the
manner of trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it
W38 to purchase upon the coast for trifles--such as beads, toys,
knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only
gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but Negroes,
for the service of the Bra-ails, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these beside, but especially to that part which related to the
buying Negroes, which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by
assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public stock; so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessively dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what I had dis-
coursed with them of the last night, and they came to make a
{secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me secrecy, they
field me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and were
stmitenod for nothing so much as servants ; that as it was a
trade that could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they
desired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own plantations ; and,
in a word, the question was, Whether I would go their super-
('argo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of
Guinea: and they oilerod me that I should have my equal
share of the Negroes, without providing any port of the stock.
' This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to :my one that had not had a. settlement and a planta-
tion of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of
coming to be very considerable, and with a good stool: upon
it; but for me, that was thus entered and established, and
had nothing to do but to {:0 on as I had begun, for three or
four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred
pounds from England : and who in that time. and with that
little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three
or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too----
for me to think of such :1 voyage was the most preposterous
thing that ever man in such circumshmces could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling
designs when my father's good counsel was lest upon me. I n
a word, I told them I would go with all heart, if they would
undertake to look after my plantation in my absence, and
would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or
covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of
my plantation and effects in case of my death, making the
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my
universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as>>
I had directed in my will; one-half of the produce being to
himself, and the other to be shipped in England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects,
and to keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much
prudence to have looked into my own interest, and have made
a. judgment of what I ought to have done and not to have
done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving cir-
cumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all
its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to
expect particular misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy rather than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done,
as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an evil hour, the 1st September, 1659, being the same
day eight years that I went from my father and mother at
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool
to my own interests. .-

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden,
carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his
boy, and myself. We had on heard no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the Negroes,
such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifies, especially
little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch
over for the African coast when we came about ten or twelve
degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner
of course in those days. We had very good weather, only
excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came
to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; from whence, keeping
further elf at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we
were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our
course N .E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, and
were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two
minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane,
took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from the south-
east, came about to the north-west, and then settled in the
north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive,
and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate
and the fury of the winds directed ; and, during these twelve
days, I need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed
up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.

I n this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one
of our men die of the calenture, and one man and the boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather
abating a little, the master made an observation as well as he
could, and found that he was in about eleven degrees north

I:
latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude
difl'eronco west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found
he was upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil,
beyond the river Amazons, towards that of the river Oroonoque,
commonly called the Great River ; and began to consult with
me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and
very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the
coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the chart.
of the' searcoast of America. with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we come
within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping oil at
sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail;
whereas we could not poseibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to
ourselves.

\Vith this design we changed our course, and steered away
NAN-'1 by \V., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief. But our voyage was otherwise deter?
mined; for, being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen
minutes, a. second storm come upon us, which carried us away
with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of
the way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been
saved as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured
by savages than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of
our men early in the morning cried out, " Land!" and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of
seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck
upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped,
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immedi-
ate] y driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very
foam and spray of the sea. _

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like con-
dition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
circumstances. \Ve knew nothing where we were, or upon
what land it was we were driven--whether an island or the
main, whether inhabited or not inhabited. As the rage of the
wind was still great though rather less than at first, we could
not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes
without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a. kind of
miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat
looking upon one another, and expecting death every moment,
and every man, accordingly, preparing for another world; for
there was little or nothing more for us to do in this. That which
was our present comfort, and all the comfort We had, was that,
contrary to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and
that the master said the wind began to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking
too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dremlful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving
our lives as well as we could. W 0 had a boat at our stern just
before the storm, but she was first stared by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place, she broke away and
either sunk, or was driven cit to sea; so there was no hope
from her. \V'e had another boat on board, but how to get her
off into the sea was a doubtful thing. However, there was no
time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every minute, and some told us she was actually broken
already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men, got her slung over
the ship's side ; and getting all into her, let go, and committed

ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy and the
wild sea ; for though the storm was abated considerabl y, yet
the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be well
called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw

plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not live,
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to makingsail,
we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done anything
,with it; so we worked at the car towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all
knew that when the boat came nearer the shore, she would be
dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner ; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep

' n 2
or shoal, we knew not. The only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might find
some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great
chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was
nothing like this appeared 3 but as we made nearer and nearer
the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a mging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling aster-n of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it ovcrsct
the boat at once ; and separating us, as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time to say, " O God! " for we
were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave having,7 driven me, or rather carried me,
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, Went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath left, that, seeing myself nearer the mainland than I
expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on
towards the land as fast as I could, before another wave
should return and take me up again ; but I soon found it was
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had
no means or strength to contend with: my business was to
'hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could;
and so, by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot
'myself towards the shore, if possible, my greatest concern
now being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way
towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the
shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water: and though it was
'not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I
held it out ; and, finding the water had spent itself and begun
to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments to recover breath and till the waters went from me,
and then took to my heels and ran, with what strength
1 had, further towards the shore. But neither would this
deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring
in after me again ; and twice more I was lifted up by
the waves and carried forward as before, the shore being
very flat. '

The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me,
for the sea having hurried me alon , as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of arock, and that with such
force, that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat
the breath, as it were, quite out of my body; and had it
returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water; but I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I
resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my
breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the
waves were not so high as at first, being nearer land, I held
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to
carry me away; and the next run I took, I got to the main
land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of
(the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger
and quite out of the reach of the water. .

l was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there
Was, some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I- believe
it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say,
out of the very grave : and I do not wonder now at the custom,

'When a malefaotor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied

it, that the surprise may not. drive the animal spirits from the
heart, and overwhelm him.

For sudden joys. like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of
my deliverance: making a thousand gestures and motions,
whieli 1 cannot describe: reflecting upon all my comrades
that were drowned. and that there should not be one. soul
saved but myself : for. as for them, I never saw them after-
wards. or any sign of them. except three of their hats, one
cap. and two shoes that were not fellows. ,

a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my

lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast

 

"ml om INTO A TREE TO SLEEP.

asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have
done in my condition, and found myself more refmshed with
it than, I think, I ever was on such an occasion.

' When I weked it was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea. did not rage and swell as
before. But that which aux-prised me most was, that the :1 ip72 .. LIFE AND Alwnmunns ..

was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay by
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as
the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being
within about a. mile from the shore where I was, and the
ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board,
that at least I might save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat,
which lay, as the wind and the sea. had tossed her up, upon
the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as
far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a
neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was
about half a mile brood; so I come back for the present,
being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to
find something for my present subsistence.

A little after noon, I found the see very calm, and the tide
ebhed so far out that I could come within a. quarter of a. mile
of the ship. And here I found a. fresh renewing of my grief ;
for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe--that is to say, we had all got safe on shore,
and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely desti-
tute of all comfort and company as I now was. This forced
tears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that,
I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my
clothes--for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the
water. But when I came to the ship my dilliculty was still
greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within my
reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the
second time I spied a. small piece of rope, which I wondered
1 did not see at first, hung down by the fore-chains so low, as
that with great difliculty I got hold of it, and by the help of
that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship. Hero I
found that the ship was bulged, and had a. great deal of water
in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard
sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lifted up upon the
bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means
all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to
see what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found
that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the
water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the
bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I
went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also
found some rum in the great mbin, of which I took a large
dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat
to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would
be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had; and this extremity roused my application. We had
several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood,
and a spare top-mast or two in the ship: I resolved to fall to
work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as
I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope,
that they might not drive away. When this was done I
went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied
four of them together at both ends. as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very
well, but that it was not able to hear any great weight, the
pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with a car-
penter's saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and
added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains.
But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done
upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea: but I
was not long considering this. I first laid all the plank or
boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well
what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them
down upon my raft; the first of these I filled with provisions, .
viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little re-
mainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some
fowls which we brought to sea. with us, but the fowls were
killed. There had been some barley and wheat together;
but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the
rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found
several cases of bottles belonging to our skinner. in which
were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six
gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being
no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.
\Vhile I was doing this, I found the tide begin to flow, though
very calm , and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt,
and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the sand,
iswim away. As for my breaches, which were only linen, and
open-knee'd, 1 swam on board in them and my stockings.
However, this set me on rummaging for clothes, of which I
found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon--us,
first, tools to work with on shore. And it was after long
searching that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was,
indeed, a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-load of gold would have been at that time. .1 got
it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to
look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for m'MllL' ammunition and arms. There
were two very good feuding-pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols. These I secured lirst, with some pomlcr-horns and a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. 1 know there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them ; but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.
Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well froighted, and began to think how I should
get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder;
and the least capful of wind would have ovurset all my
navigation.

I had three encouragements : let, a smooth, calm sea ; Qnr ly,
.the tide rising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly. what little
'I'Iind tho-r0 was blew me towards the land. And thus, having
found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat--and,
besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two saws,
an axe, and a hammer: with this cargo I put to sea. For a
mile, or thereahouts, my raft went very well, only that I
found it drive a little distant from the place where I had
landed before; by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently, I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it. was. There appeared before me alittle
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set
into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to keep in the
middle of the stream.

But here I had like to have suffered a. second shipwreck,
which, if I had, I think, verily, would have broken my heart;

 

CRUSOE'S RAFT IS NEARLY UPSET.

for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one
end of it upon a, shoal, and not being aground at the other
end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped ofi
towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to
keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft
with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture
I was in; but holding up the chests with all my might, I
stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the
rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level ; and,
a little after, the water still rising. my raft floated again, and
I thrust her oif wit-h the our I had into the channel, and then
driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current 0'
tide running up. I looked on both sides for a. proper place to
get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up
the river : hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and there-
fore resolred to place myself as near the coast as I could. '
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,
to which. with great pain and difficulty, I guided my wit, and
at last got. so near, that, reaching ground with my oar, I could
thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all
my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep
--that is to say, sloping--there was no place to land, but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so
high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would en-
danger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait- till
the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my ear
like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore. near a.
ilat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow
over ; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough ~for
my raft drew about a foot of water--I thrust her upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored hr-r. by stick.
ing my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side, near
mm end, and one on the other side, near the other end ; and
thus I lay till the water ebhed away, and left my raft and alli
:ny mrgo safe on shore. '
My next work was to View the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew
not; whether on the continent or on an island ; whether in-
habited or not inhabited ; whether in danger of wild beasts or
not. There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose
up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some
other hills, which lay as in uridgo from it, northward. I took
out one of the fowling'pieces, and one. of the pistols, and a hornor nonmsos CBUSOE. 77

of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to
the top of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and
difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great aflliction,'
viz. that I was in an island environed every way with the
sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great
way off ; and two small islands, less than this, which lay
about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as 1
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts,
of whom, however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds ; neither when I killed them could I
tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back,
I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side
of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been
fired there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
fired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumer-
able number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused
screaming and crying, and every one according to his usual
note, but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for
the creature I killed, I took it to be akind of hawk, its colour
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more
than common. Its flesh was Carrion, and lit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up
the rest of that day. \Vhat to do with myself at night I
knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really no
need for those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made
a kind of but for that night's lodging. 'As for food, I yet saw
not which way to supply myself. except that I had seen two or)
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land ; and I resolved to make another voyage
on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart till I had got everything
out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a. council---
that is to say, in my thoughts--whether I should take back
the raft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go
as before, when the tide was down; and I did so, only that
I stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on but
a chequered shirt, 9. pair of linen drawers, and a. pair of pumps
on my feet.

Igot on board the ship as before, and prepared a. second
raft; and, having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me; as, first, in the
mrpcnter's stores I found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a. grindstone. All
these I secured, together with several things belonging to the
gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
of musket bullct-s, seven muskets, another fowling-piece, with
some small quantity of powder more ; a large bagful of small
shot, and a great roll of shect~lead; but this last was so heavy,
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore--top sail, a hammock, and some
bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought
them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort. _

I was under some apprehension, during my absence from
the land, that at least my revisions might be devoured on
shore : but when I came heel; I found no sign of any visitor ;
only there sat a creature like a wild out upon one of the
(chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a. little
distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but, as
she (lid not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it,
nor (lid she olfcr to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit
of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very free of it, '
for my store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked
(as if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare
no more : so she marched elf.

Having got my second cargo on shore--though I was fain
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for
they were too heavy, being large casks--I went to work to make
me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles which I cut
for that purpose: and into this tent I brought everything
that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,
to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
' When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end
without; and spreading one of the beds upon the ground,
laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length
by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly
all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, to
fetch all those things from the ship, and to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was
laid up, I believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still,
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I
ought to get everything out of her that I could: so every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away something
or other ; but particularly the third time I went I brought
away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas,
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of
wet gunpowder. In a. word, I brought away all the sails, first
and last; on] that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and
bring as muc at a time as I could, for they were no more
useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still, was, that last of
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was
worth my meddling with ;--I say, after all this, I found a
glent hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits,
a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was sun
prising to me, because I had given over expecting any more
provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon
emptied the hogshead of the bread, and mapped it up, parwl
by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a
word, I got all this safe on shore also. :

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out,
I began with the cables. Cutting the great cable into pieces,
such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the ironwork I could get; and having cut down the80 Lin: AND anvmrunes

spritsail-yard, and the mizen--yard, and everything I could, to
make a. large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and
came away. But my good luck began now to leave me 3 for
this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that, after I had
entered the little cove where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not being able to guide it so handilyas I didthe other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As
i for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore;
I but as to my cargo, it was a. great part of it lost, especially
I the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to
" me : however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of the cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite
labour; for I was fain to clip for it into the water, a work
which fatigued me very much. After this, I went every day
on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship, in which time I had brought away
all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to
bring ; though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I
should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece. But
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind
began to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually,
that nothing more could be found, yet I discovered a. locker
with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
razors. and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen
of good knives and forks: in another I found about thirty-
six pounds value in money--some European coin, some Brazil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money : " 0 drug l "
said I, aloud, " what art thou good for'l Thou art not worth
to me--no, not the taking OK the ground : one of those knives
is worth all this heap: I have no manner of use for thee--'
e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a Creaturel
whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second,
thoughts, I took it away; and, wrapping all this in a piece-
of (mums, I began to think of making another raft; but while
I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind
begun to rise, and in a. quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in
vain to pretend to make a. raft with the wind OE shore ; and
that it was my'business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.
Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam
across the channel which lay between the ship and the sands,
and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight
of the things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the
water ; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
high water it blew a storm.

But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all
my wealth about me, very secure. It blew very hard all:
night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold no more
ship was to be seen 1 I was a little surprised, but recover-rd
myself with the satisfactory reflection, that I had lost no
time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any-
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her
wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did ; but
those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to
make--whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a
tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both; the
manner and description of which, it may not be improper to
give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settle-
ment, because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea,
and I believed it would not be wholesome, and more particularly
because there was no fresh water near it 3 so I resolved to find
a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me: let, health and fresh water, I just
now mentioned ; Emily, shelter from the heat of the sun ;
3rdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether man or
beast ; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of
which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain or.
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain
was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down

5
upon me from the top. On the side of the rock there was a
hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door
of a cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the
rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay
like a. green before my door; and, at the end of it, descended
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the see-
side. It was on the N.N.\V. side of the hill; so that it was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a \V. and
by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near
the setting.

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-
diameter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter,
from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two "rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground above five feet
and a. half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not
stand above six inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle,
between those'two rows of stakes, up to the top placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them. about two feet and
a half high, like a spur to a. post; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it.
This cost me a. great deal of time and labour, especially to cut
the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them
into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door,
but by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when
[was in, I lifted over after me; and so I was completely
fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I
could not have done ; though. as it appeared afterwards, there
was no need of all this caution from the enemies that I
apprehended danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried
all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores,
of which you have the account above; and I made a. large
tent, which, to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of
the year are very violent there, I made double, one smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it; and covered the
uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among
the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had

brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
{good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
', Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all
my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left
opeg, and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short
lad er. '

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half ; and thus I made me a. cave, just behind my
tent, which served me like a collar to my house.

It cost me much labour and many days before all these
things were brought to perfection ; and, therefore, I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts.
At 'the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of
rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is
naturally the eficct of it. I was not so much surprised with
the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my
mind as swaft as the lightning itself--0 my powder! My
very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast,
all my powder might be destroyed ; on which, not my defence
ionly, but the providing my food, as I thought, entirely de-
pended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger,
though, had the powder took fire, I should never have known .

the had hurt me. '

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and
iortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to sepa-
rate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a eel,
-'in the hope that whatever might come, it might not take
fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be
possible to make one part the another. I finished this work

3' 2
in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all
was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was divided
in not less than a hundred parcels. As to the bar: e1 that had
been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that; so I
placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my
kitchen 3 and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out
once at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself,
as to see if 1 could kill anything lit for food ; and, as near as
I could, to acquaint myself with what (he island produced.
The first tinio I went out, I presently discovered that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me ;
but then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was
the most diflicult thing in the world to come at them ; but I
was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now
and then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for aft-er I had
found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for
them : I observed if they saw me in the valleys, though they
were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a. terrible
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I
concluded, that by the position of their optics, their sight was
so directed downward, that they did not readily see objects
that were above them; so afterwards, I took this method,--
1 al ways climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then
had frequently a fair mark.

The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she.
goat, which had a. little kid by her, which she gave suck to,
which grieved me heartily; for, when the old one fell, the kid
stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and not
only so, but when I carried the old one with me, upon my
shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure; upon
which, I laid down the darn, and took the kid in my arms,
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame ;
but it would not cut; so I was forced to kill it, and eat it
myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for
I ate sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread especially,
as much as possibly I could

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a. place to make a fire in, and fuel to
burn; and what I did for that, and also how I enlarged my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full ac
count of in its place; but I must now give some little account
of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it may
well be supposed, were not a few. f

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not'
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said,
by a violent storm, quite out of the course of our intended
voyage, and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out
of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great
reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end
my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when
I made these reflections ; and sometimes I would expostulate
with myself why Providence should thus completely ruin His
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable ; so with-
out help, abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day,
walking with my gun in my hand by the sea--side, I was very
pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when reason,
as it were, expostulated with me the other way, thus: " Well,
you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember,
where are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you
in the boat 3 Where are the ten? Why were not they saved,
and you lost 1 Why were you singled out? Is it better to
be here or there 1 " And then I pointed to the sea. All evils
are to be considered with the good that is in them, and with
what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished fox
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had
.not happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that thi

iship floated from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her; what would have been my wee, if I had
been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at
first come on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries
to supply and procure them? " Particularly," said I aloud
(though to myself), "what should I have done without a gun,
without ammunition, without any tools to make anything, or

\
to work with, without clothes, bedding, a. tent, or any manner'
of covering?" and that now I had all these to sufficient
quantity, and was in a. fair way to provide myself in such a.
manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was

 

CRUSOE WALKS BY THE SEAvSIDE IN GREAT DYJECKON-

spent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without
any want, as long as I lived ; for I considered from the be-
ginning, hmv I would provide for the accidents that might'
happen, and for the time that was to come, even not only afterr -\
or someone anneal. 81

my ammunition should he spent, but even after my health and
strength should decay.

I confem, I had not entertained any notion of my ammuni-
tion being destroyed at one blast--I mean my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it
so surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I
observed just now.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a
scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in.
the world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and
continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of
September, when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot
upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to us in its,
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head: for I
reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine
degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line.

After 1 had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for
want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the
Sabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut with my knife upon
a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a great
cross, I set up on the shore where I first landed, "I came on
shore here on the 30th of September, 1659."

Upon the sides of this square post I out every day a notch
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first day of the month, as long again as
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place, we are to observe that among the many
things which I brought out of the ship, in the several voyages
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things
of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitmd,
setting down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
several pmels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical
instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of naviga-
tion, all which I huddled together, whether I might want
them or no 3 also, I found three very good Bibles, which came
to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also; and, among
them, two or three Popish prayer-books, and several other
books, all which I carefullysecured. And I must not forget.88' LIFE mu onnxrunas

that we had in the ship a dog, and two'cats, or whose eminent
history Inlay have occasion to say something in its place; for
I earned both the "cats with me; and us for the dog, he
jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a
trusty servant to me many yam-s; I wanted nothing that he
could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to
me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would
not do. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, '
fund I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show that
while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that
was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink by any
'means that I could devise. " .. - ' '

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these,
ink was one ; as also a. spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or
remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily;
and it was near a. whole year before I had entirely finished
my little pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or
stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long
time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by for,
in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in
cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day
in driving it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a
heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of
one of the iron crows; which, however, though I found it,
made driving these posts or piles very laborious and tedious
work. But what need I have been concerned at the tedious-
ness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do
it in? nor had I any other employment, if that had been over,
'at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to
seek for food, which I did, more or less, every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstances I was reduced to ; and I drew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that
were to come after me--for I was likely to have but few heirs
-as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over them, and
afflicting my mind: and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could,
and to set the good against the evil, that I might have some-OP ROBINSON 013.1180?- 89

thing to distinguish my case'from worse - and I stated 7
fingertially, like debtor and creditor, the 'comiorts I erfiogd
against the miseries I suffered, thus :--- '

from this condition '

But I am not starved, and
perishing on a barren place,
afl'ording no sustenance.

But I am in a hot climate,
where, if I had clothes, I
could hardly wear them.

But I am cast on an island
where I see no wild beasts to
hurt me, as I saw on the coast
of Africa; and what if I had
been shipwrecked there?

But God wonderiuuy sent
the ship in near enough to the
shore, that I have got out as
many necessary things as will
either supply my wants or
enable me to supply myself,
even as long as I live.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but

there was something

negative or something

positive to be

thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this

world: that we may always find in it something

to comfort

ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and evil,
on the credit side of the account. ,90 LIFE mm ADVEX'l'L'RES

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condi-
tion, and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a
ship--I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself
to arrange my way of living, and to make things as easy to
me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of sts
and cables; but 1 might now rather call it a wall, or I
[raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet
thick on the outside ; and after some time (I think it was a
year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock,
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such
things as I could get, to keep out the rain ; which I found at
some times of the your very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me.
But I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap
of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all
my place 3 I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to
enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it was
a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I
bestowed on it: and so when I found I was pretty safe as to
beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand, into the
rock; and then, turning to the right again, worked quite
out, and made me a door to come out on ;the outside of my
pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress and
regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my store-
house, but gave me room to store my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such neceSSary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and
a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few
comforts I had in the world; I could not write or eat, or do
several things, with so much pleasure without!>> table: so I
went to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason
is the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating
and squaring everything by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in
my life; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and con.
trivaucc, 1 found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made
abundance ofwthings, even without tools 3 and some with no.
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour.
For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to
out down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and how it flat
on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be thin as
a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree ;
but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
me up to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
another.

However, I made me a table and a. chair, as I observed
above, in the first place; and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my raft from the shi . But when
I had wrought out some boards as above, I made arge shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another all along
one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work
on; and, in a word, to separate everything at large into their
places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked pieces
into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that
would hang up: so that, had my cave beento be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had
everything so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure
to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find
my stock of all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much
hurry, and not only hurry as to labour, but in too much
discomposure of mind; and my journal would have been full
of many dull things; for example, I must have said thus:

,"Sept. 30th.--After I had got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliver"
Sauce, having first vomited, with the great quantity of salt
water which had got into my stoma/h, and recovering myself
a little, I ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating
my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out,
' I was undone, undone 1' till, tired and faint, I was forced to
lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear
of being devoured."

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not92 LIFE AND .\l-\'lL\'l'('llES

my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household staff and habitation, nmde me a.
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal; of which I shall here give you the
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again)

as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it 05.

THE JOURNAL.

September 30, 1659.--I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe,
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the oiling,
mule on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I
called " The Island of Despair ;" all the rest of the ship's
company being drowned, and myself almost dead. ' -

All the rest of the day I spent in amicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to; viz. I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to; and, in
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me--
either that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by
savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach
of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept
soundly, though it rained all night.

October l.--In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore
again much nearer the island; which, as it was some comfort,
on one hand--for, seeing her set upright, and not broken to
pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, and
get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief--so, on
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my com-
rades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might
have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been
all drowned, as they were ; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the
ship, to have carried us to some other part. of the world. I
spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things; but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went
upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. -
This day also it continued raining, though with no wind
at all.

From the lst of October to the 24th.--All these days
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could out
of the ship, which I brought on shore every tide of flood upon
rafts. Much rain also in the days, though with some inter
Vale of fair weather; but it seems this was the rain season.

Oat. 20.----1 ovorset my raft, and all the goods had got,upon it; but, being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide
was out.

Oct. 25.--It rained all night and all day, with some gusts
of wind; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the
wind blowing a little harder than before, and was no more
to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low
water. 1 spent this day in covering and securing the goods
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26.--I walked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts
or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place, under a
rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment; which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification,
made of double piles, lined within with cables, and without
with turf.

From the 261211 to 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceedingly hard.

The Met, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country; when
I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I
afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.

Xvi-ember l.--I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night ; making it as large as I could, with stake-s
driven in to swing my hammock upon.

Nor. 2,--1 set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence
round me, a. little within the place I had marked out for my
fortification .

2 Nov. 3.--I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to
work to make me a table.

Nor. 4.----This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diver'
sion ; viz--every morning I walked out with my gun for two
or three hours, if it did not min; then employed myself to
work till about eleven o'clock ; then eat what 1 had to live on ;
and from twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work
again. The working part of this day and of the next were
wholly employed in 'making my table, for I was yet but a
very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a
complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would
do any one else.

Nov. 5.-----This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog,
and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good
for nothing ; every creature that I killed I took oil the skins
and preserved them. Coming back by the seashom, I saw'
many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was
surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they
were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nor. 6.--After my morning walk, I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.

ll'u-v. '1'.----Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday),
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and
even in the making I pulled it in pieces several times.

Note--I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13.--This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed-
ingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me dreadfully,
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger.

N x 14, 15, l6.--These three days I spent in making little
square chests, 9r boxes, which might hold about a pound, or
two pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder
in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another
as possible. On one of these three days, I killed a large bird

h'that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

N '. I7.--This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my further conveniency.

Note--Three things I wanted exwedingly for this work;
viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a. wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I
desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply
that want, and make me some tools. As for the piokaxe, I
made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was 'a shovel, or spade; this was
so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing cll'ec-
tually without it ; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

Nov. lS.----The next day, in searching the woods, I found a.
tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness. Of this, with great
labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a. piece, and brought
it home, too, with dillicnlty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having:
no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I
worked it elfcctually by little and little into the form of a.
shovel or spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in
England, only that the board part having no iron shod upon
it at bottom, it would not last me so long ; however, it
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it
to ; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion,
or so long in making.

I was. still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a. wheel-

barrow. A basket 1 could not make by any means, having no
such things as twigs that would bend to make wickernwaro--
at least. none yet found. out; and as to a wheelbarrow, I
fancied I could make all but the wheel ; but that I had no
notion of ; neither did I know how to go about it; besides I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle
or axis of the wheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for
carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made
me a thing like a bed which the labourers carry mortar in
when they serve the bricklayers. This was not so ditlicult to
me as the making the shovel; and yet this and the shovel,
and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,
took me up no less than four days--I mean always excepting
my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and
very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to eat.
. .l'nr. 23.--My other work having now stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were finished 1 went on,
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed. I
suent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodionsl y.

Note--During all this time, I worked to make this room or
care spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my
lodging, I. kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet
season of the year. it rained so hard that I could not keep' ' or aosmsos'Eauson 97

thyself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover an my place
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of
trees, like a thatch.

December 10.--I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large)
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top on one side;
so much that, in short, it frighted me, and not without reason,
too, for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-
digger. I had now a great deal of work to do over again, for
I had the loose earth to carry out ; and, which was of more
importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be
sure no more would come down.

Dec. ll.--This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of boards across over each post; this I finished the
next day; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a
week more I had the roof secured, and the posts, standing in
rows, served me for partitions to part off the house.

Dec. 17 .--From this day to the 20th I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up
that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some
order within doors.

Dec. 20.--Now I carried everything into the cave, and
began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards
like a dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but boards began
to be very scarce with me; also, I made me another table.

Dec. 24.--Much rain all night and all day. No stirring
out.

Dec. 25.-----Rain all day.

Dec. 26.---No rain, and the earth much cooler than before
and pleasanter.

' Dec. 27.--Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that
I caught it and led it home in a. string; when I had it at
home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.

N.B.--I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew
well and as strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and
would not go away. This was the first time that I enter--
tained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I
might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31.--~Great beats, and no breeze, so that

a'98'. ' urn m Marmara

there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food';
this time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.

January l.-----Very hot still: but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards
the centre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats.
though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I
resolved to try if I could not bring my dogto hunt them down.

Jan. 2,--Accordingly, the next day I went out with my
dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for
they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger
too well, for he would not come near them.

Jan. 3,--I began my fence, or wall ; which, being still
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make
very thick and strong.

N.B.---This wall being described before. I purposely omit
what was said in the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that
I was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of
April working. finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a
half--circle from one place in the rock to another place, about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering mo
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ;
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced,
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that
if any people were to come on shore there, they would not per-
ceive anything like a habitation ; and it was very well I did so,
as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day when the rain permitted me, and made frequent
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my
advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons,
which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as
house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some
young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and'
did so; but when they grew older they flew away, which
perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had.
nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their-
nests, and got their young ones, which were very good
meat. And now, in the managing my household afiairs, I-'
found myself wanting in many things, which I thought at,
first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed, with some
of them it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to
he hooped. I had a. small runlet or two, as I observed before;
but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by
them, though I spent many weeks about it; I could neither
put in the heads, or join the staves so true to one another as'
to make them hold water; so I gave that also over. In the
next place, I was at a great loss for candles ; so that as soon
as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-
wax with which I made candles in my African adventure;
but I had none of that now ; the only remedy I had was, that
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me
light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In the
middle of all my labours. it happened that, rummaging my
things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been
filled with corn for the feeding of poultry--not for this voyage,
but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon.
The little remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all
devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks
and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some other
use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for
fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of
corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock. 1

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned
that I threw this stufl' away, taking no notice, and not so ,
much as remembering that I had thrown anything there,
when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few
stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which I
fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was sur-
prised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European--nay,
as our English barley. 2

0100 an: we ADVENTUREQ

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon
no religious foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions
Inf religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any-
thing that had befallen me. otherwise than as chance, or, as

 

CRUSOB 13 ASTOSBHED AT T!!! GROW?! 0P BARK."-

we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquire
ing into the end of Providence in these things, or His order
in governing events {or the world. But after I saw barley
grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn.or accuses causes. , 10!

and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miracuq
lously caused His grain to grow without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on
that wild, miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account; and this was the more
strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side
of the rock,' some other straggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubting that there was more in the
place, I went all over that part of the island, where I had
been before, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to
see for more of it, but I could not find any. At last it
occurred to my thoughts, that I shook a bag of chickens'
meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease;
and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to God's provi-
dence began to abate, too, upon the discovering that all this
was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have
been as thankful forso strange and unforeseen a providence, as
if it had been miraculous ; for it was really the work of Pro-
vidence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve
grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had
destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven ;
as also, that I should throw it out in that particular place,
where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up
immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at
that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying
up every com, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping. in
time, to have some quantity, sufiicient to supply me with'
bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost
all that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper
time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it
never came up at all, at least not as it would have done 5 of
which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for
_the same use, or to the same purpose--to make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it without baking,
though I did that also after some time.

But to return to my Journal :-----

I worked excessive hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done ; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, con-
.zriving to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by
a. ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my
habitation.

April 16.--I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
in the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me ; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from
without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The
case was thus :---As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent,
just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed ; for, all on n. sudden,
I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my
cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of
the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful
manner. I was heartily scared ; but thought nothing of what
was really the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave
was fallen in, as some of it had done before: and for fear I
should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down

' upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm
:ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for
lthe ground I stood on shook three times at about eight
minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have over-
turned the strougest building that could be supposed to have
stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a. rock
which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down,
with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I
perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it;
and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than
on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was
like one dead or stupified ; and the motion of the earth made
my stoth sick, like one that was tossed at see; but the
noise of the falling of the rock aweked me, as it were, and
rousing me from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with
horror; and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling
upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at
once ; and this sunk my very soul within me a. second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough
to go over my well again, for fear of being buried alive, but
set still upon the ground greatly cost down and disconsolete,
not knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the least
serious religious thought; nothing but the common " Lord have
mercy upon me!" and when it was over that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy,
as if it would ruin. Soon after that, the wind arose by little
and little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most
dreadful hurricane, the see was all on a. sudden coveredover
with foam and froth; the shore was covered with the breech
of the water; the trees were torn up by the roots; and a ter-
rible storm it was. This held about three hours, and then
begun to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and
began to rein very hard. All this while I set upon the
ground. very much terrified and dejected ; when on a sudden
it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the
consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was
spent and over, and I might venture into my cave again.
With this thought, my spirits began to revive; and the rain
also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my
tent. But the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to
be beaten down with it ; and I was forced to go into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on
my head. This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a. hole through my new fortification, like a. sink, to let thel
water go out, which would else have floodedmy cave. After'
I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more
shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to'lhe' more 'com'
posed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeedwanted
it ve much, I went to my little store, snd' tooke smell
sup 0 rum; which, however, I did then 'ond'elweys very
sparingly, knowing I could have no more when 'that'was gone:
It continued milling all that night, and great part of the next
day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but my mind being more
composed, I began to think of what I had best do; conclud-
ing, that if the. island was subject to these earthquakes, there
would be no living for me in a care, but I must consider of
building a little but in an open place, which I might surround
with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure
from wild beasts or men ; for I concluded ii I stayed where I
was, 1 should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

\Vith these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging preci-
pice of the hill; and which, if it should be shaken again,
would certainly fall upon my tent ; and I spent the two next
days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swal-
lowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet
the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was
almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw
how everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed
I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to
remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must
be contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp
for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with
this resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that
[would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with
piles and cables, &c. in a. circle, as before, and set my tent up
in it, when it was finished; but that I would venture to
stay where I was till it was finished, and fit to remove. This
was the 21st.

' April ill--The next morning I began to consider of means
to put this resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss
about my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of?

' hatchet-s (for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the

Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard

wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I

had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.

This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have

bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the

life and death of a man. At length, I contrived a wheel with

a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty.
Note--I hob never seen any such thing in England, or
at leut not to take notice how it was done, though since 1
have observed it is very common there; besides that, my
grinds-tone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me
a full week's work to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29.--These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.

April 30.--Having perceived my bread had been lowa great,
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one
biscuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy. l

May 1.--In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to it, I
found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of,
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane;
and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed
to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was
a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the
powder was caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled
it farther on shore for the present, and went on upon the
sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look
for more. '

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was
heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in
pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon
after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up,
and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on
that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place
of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of
a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk'
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the
earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was more broke
open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore,
which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of
removing my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that
day especially, in searching whether I could make any war
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected 0? that
kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand.
However, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I
resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of tho ship,
concluding that everything I could get from her would be of
some use or other to me.

May 3.---I began with my new, and cut a piece of a beam '
through, which I thought hold some of the upper part or
quarter-dock together, and when I had cut it through, I
cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which
lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give
over for that time.

Hay 4.---I wont a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport ; when, just going to
leave oil, I caught a. young dolphin. I had made me a long
line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I
dried in the sun, and ate them dry.

May 5.------\Vorked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which I
tied together, and made to float on shore when the tide of
flood came on.

Mu." 6.--Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron-work. "'orked very hard,
and came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving
it over.

May 7.--Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams being cut ; that several pieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open
that I could soe into it ; but it was almost full of water and _
"Rind.

,llag/ 8.----Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow tc)
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water-3
or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide I left the iron crew in the wreck
for next day.

May 9.-----Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow, but could not break them up.
I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was
too heavy to remove.
Hay10--14.--Went every day to the wreck; and got a
great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two
or three hundredweight of iron.

May 15.------I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut
a. piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other ; but as it lay about a foot and
a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the'
hatchet. ;

May 16.---It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed
so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide
prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17 .----I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at
A great distance, near two miles oi'i me, but resolved to see
what they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but
too heavy for me to bring away.

May 24.--Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck;
and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the
crew, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that da but pieces of timber, and
a. hogshead, which had some Brazily pork in it; but the salt
water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work
every day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to
get food, which I always appointed, during this part of my
employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready
when it was ebbed out; and by this time I had got timber
and plank and iron--work enough to have built a good best,
if I had known how; and also I got, at several times and in
several pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheetdead.

June 16.---Going down to the sea-side, I found a large.
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it
seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place,
'or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other side of
the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day,
as I foupd afterwards; but perhaps had paid enough dear for
them.

me l7.--I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the
most savoury and pleasant that ever I tested in In life,
having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I nded
in this horrid place.
J2me 18.--Rainod all day, and I stayed within. I thought,
at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chill",
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

June ISL--Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had
been cold.

June 20.--No rest all night; violent pains in iny head, and
feverish.

June 2I.---Very ill; frighted almost to death with the
apprehensions of my sad condition--to be sick, and no help.'
Frayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hull,
but scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being all
confused.

June 2'3.-----A little better; but under dreadful apprehen-
sions of sickness.

June filth--Very had again; cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.

J7me Shh--Much better.

June 25.-An ague very violent: the fit held me seven
hours; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.

June 26.--Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak. However, I killed a she-
goat, and with much diiliculty got it home, and broiled some
of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.

June 27.--The ague again so violent that I lay e-bed all
day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for
thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to
get myself any water to drink. Frayed to God again, but
was light headed; and when l was not, I was so ignorant
that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, " Lord,
look upon niel Lord, pity me i Lord, have mercy upon me i "
I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours; till, the
(it wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in
the night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed,
but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no
water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had.
this terrible dream :~--I thought that I was sitting on the
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I set when the
storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a. man
descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire;
and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a
flame, so that I could but just hear to look towards him; his
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for
words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground with
his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my
apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He
was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward
towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill
me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance,
he spoke to me--or I heard a voice so terrible that it is im--
possible to express the terror of it. All that I can say I
understood was this :--"Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die; "--at which
words, I thought he lifmd up the spear that was in his
hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I
even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when
I awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked-
ness, and a <<instant conversation with none but such as were,
like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that so
much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or
inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a
certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or conscience
of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that.
'the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our
common sailors can be supposed to be 5 not having the least
,sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness
to God, in deliverance.

| In the relating what is already past of my story, this will
be the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through
all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I
never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of.
God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin. My rebel-'
lions behaviour against my father--or my present sins, which
{were great,--or so much as a punishment for the general
course of my wicked lilo. \Vhon I was on the desperate
expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much
as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish to
God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from vora-
cious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely thought-
less of a. God or 9. Providence, acted like a more brute, from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense
lonly, and, indeed, hardly tlmt. \Vhen I was delivered and
ltaken up at sea by the Portugal mptoin, well used, and dealt
justly and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the least thankfulncss in my thoughts. \Vhon, again, I was
shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this
island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a. judg--
ment. I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate
dog, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised
with a. kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which,
had the grace of God assisted, might have come up to true
thankfulncss; but it ended where it began, in a mere common
flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without
the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the
hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be
preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry
why Providence had been thus merciful unto me. Even just
the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have,
after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck. which they
drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon
as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it. Evrn
when I was afterwards, on duo consideration, made sensible of
my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of
'the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect
of redemption, as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and
that I should not storm and perish for hunger, all the sense
of my affliction wore 0E; and I began to be very easy, applied
myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply,
and was far enough from being afilicted at my condition, as a
judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me:
these were thoughts which very seldom entered my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal,
Ihad, at first, some little influence upon me, and began to atfiect
me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something
miraculous in it ; but as soon as ever that part of the thought
was removed, all the impression that was raised from it were
off also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake,'
though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more
immediately directing to the invisible power which alone
directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also. I had no more
sense of God, or His judgments--much less of the present
siiliction of my circumstances being from His hand-than if I
had been in the most prosperous condition of life. But now,
when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries
of death come to place itself before me; when my spirits begun
to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience,
th-it had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to
reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so
evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice
of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal
with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections op-
pressed me for the second or third day of my distemper;
and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful
reproaches of my conscience, extol-ted some words from me
like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires or with hopes: it was rather the
voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were mn-
fused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of
dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into my
head with the mere apprehension; and in these hurries of my
soul, I knew not what my tongue might express. But it was
rather exclamation, such as, " Lord, what a miserable creature
:un II If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of
help; and what will become of me! " Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In
this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the begin~
ning of this story, viz. that ii I did take this foolish step, God
would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be
none to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I, aloud, "my
dear father's words are come to pass; God's justice has over-
taken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I' rejected the112 um; AND "neurones

voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture
or station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy ;
out I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know the
blessing of it from my parents. I left them to mourn over
my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences
of it. I refused their help and assistance, who Would have
lifted me in the world, and would have made everything easy
to me : and now I have diflicultiee to struggle with, too grmt
lfor eve-n nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help. no
comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, "Lord, be my help,
for I am in great distress." This was the first prayer, if I
may call it so, that I had mode for many years.

But to return to my Journal :--

J1me 28.--}laving been somewhat refreshed with the sleep
I had had, and the lit being entirely ofi, I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when I should be ill 5 and the first thing I did,
I filled a large square case--bottle with water, and set it upon
my table, in reach of my lied; and to take OE the chill or
aguish disposition of the water, I fut about u. quartrr of 9.
pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got nze
a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak,
and wit-ha] very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my
miserable condition, dreadlng the return of my distemper the
next day. At night, I made my supper of three of the turtlo's
eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in
the shell, and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked
God's blessing to, that I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without
that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the.
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, '
and very calm and smooth. As I set here, some such thoughts
as those occurred to me z--W'hat is this earth and sea, of
which I have seen so much i \Vhence is it produced? And
what am I, and all the other creatures wild and tame. human
and brutal? Whence are we? Sure we are all made by some
secret power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky.
And who is that? Then it followed most naturally, it is God
that has made all. Well, but then, it came on'etrangely, if
God has made all these things, He guides and governs them
all, and all things that concern them; for the power that
could make all things must certainly have power to guide
and direct them. Is so, nothing can happen in the great
circuit of His works, either without His knowledge or
appointment.

And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if
nothing happens without His appointment, He has appointed'
all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thought to'
contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that
God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought
into this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having
the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that hap-
pened in the world. Immediately it followed,--Why has
God done. this to me! What have I done to be thus used!
My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I
had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice--
" Wretchl dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look back
upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast
not done! Ask, why is it that thou wort not long ago
dcstroyedl Why wert than not drowned in Yarmouth Roads;
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee
man-of war; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of
Africa; or drowned here, when all the crew perished but
thyself l Dost thou ask, What have I done i " I was struck
dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a
word to say--no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive
and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were
sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat.
clown in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my dis~
temper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, that
the Brazilians take no phyeic but their tobacco for almost all
distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the
chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green;
and not. quite cur . '

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I

found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and
N114 mu: AN" Anvmvm

found what I looked for, the tobacco ; and as the few books
I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found
leisure or inclination to look into. I say, I took it out, and
brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.

 

OBUHOIZ FINDS A BIBLE

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my dis-
temper, or whether it was good for it or no: but I tried
several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit
. one way or other. I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it
in my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost stupified my brain,
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been
much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or
two in some rum, and resolved to take a. dose of it when I lay

down; and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of corals, and held

my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it,

as well for the heat, as. almost for sufiocetion. In the interval
of this operation, I took up the Bible, and began to read; but
my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear
reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the book

casually, the first words that occurred to me were these.

" Cull on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,

and thou shalt glorify me." These words were very apt to
my case, and made some impression upon my thoughts at the
time of reading them, though not so much as they did after~
words; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as
I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in
my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the
children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat,
" Can God spread a table in the wilderness? " so I began to
soy, " Can God himself deliver me from this place'l " And as
it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this pre-
vailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words
made a. great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep 5 so I left my
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the
night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I
never had done in all my life--I kneeled down, and prayed to
God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon him in
the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had
steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the
tobacco that I could scarcely get it down; immediately upon
this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up into my head

violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more
till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in
the afternoon the next day--nay, to this hour I am partly of'
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise, I know not how I should
lose a. day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it
appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than
one day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never
knew which way. Be that, however, one way or the other,

H 2
when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my
spirits lively and cheerful ; when I got up I was stronger than
I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was
hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued
much altered for the better. This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a,
sen-fowl or two, something like a. brand goose, and brought!
them home ; but was not very forward to eat them ; so I ate -
some more of the turtles eggs, which were very good. This.1
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me
good the day before--the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did
not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or
hold my head over the smoke; however, I was not so well
the next day. which was the first of July, as I hoped I should
have been; for I had a. little spice of the cold fit, but it was
not much.

July 2.--I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which I drank.

July 3.----I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. W'hile I was
thus gathering strength my thoughts ran exceedingly upon
this scripture, "I will deliver thee; " and the impossibility
of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it ; but as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon
my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the
deliverance I had received, and l was as it were made to ask
myself such questions as these ; viz. : Have I not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness-~from the mast
distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightfuli
to me "i and what notice had 1 taken of it? Had I done my
part '1 God had delivered me, but 1 had not glorified Him--
thn't is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as
a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance'l
This touched my heart very much ; and immediately I knelt
down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickneSS.

July 'i.--In the morning, 1 took the Bible ; and, beginning
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and im-
posed upon myself to read a while every morning and every
night ; not tying myself to the number of chapters, but long
as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after I
set seriously to this work, till I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived; and the words, "All
these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran seriously
in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give me
repentance, when it happened providentially, the very day,
that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words: " He is
exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give
remission." I threw down the book; and with my heart as
well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of
joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou son of David 1 Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour I give me repentance I " This
was the first time I could say, in the true sense of the words,
that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with a sense
of my condition, and a true Scripture view of hope, founded
on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear
me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call
on me, and I will deliver thee,"in a different sense from what
I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from the
captivityI was in; for though I was indeed at large in tho
place,_yet the island was certainly a. prison to me, and that in
the worse sense in the world. But now I learned to take it
in another sense : now I looked back upon my past life with
such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul
sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it
was nothing ; I did not so much us pray to be delivered from
it, or think of it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison
to this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall
read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing
than deliverance from aflliction.

But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal :--

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my
thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture
and praying to God, to things of a. higher nature, I had a

great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I know nothing
of ; also. my health and strength returned. I bestirred myself
to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make
my way of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of Jul _v to the 14th, I was chielly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a. little and a little
at a time, as o. mun that was gathering up his strength after
a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The application
which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which
had never cured an nguo before ; neither can I recommend it
to any to practise, by this experiment: and though it did
<<any oil the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me;
for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for
some time. I learned from it also this, in particular, that
being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing
to my health that could be, especially in those rains which
came attended with stormsnnd hurricanes of wind ; for as the
min which came in the dry season was almost always accom-
panied with such storms, so I found that rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months.
All possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me ; and I firmly believe that no human
shape had ever set foot. upon that place. Having now seemed
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to
see what other productions I might find, which 1 yet know
nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek
first. where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found,
after 1 came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow
any higher, and that it was no more than 3 little brook of
running water, very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season there was hardly any water in some parts of it--at
least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be pen
ceived. On the banks of this brook, I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass;
and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds,
where the water. as might be supposed, never overflowed, I
found a. great deal of tobacco, green, and growing _to a great
and very strong stalk. There were divers other plants, which
I had no notion of or understanding about, that might, per-
haps have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that
climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw,
large plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw
fisoveral sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation,
imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this
time, and came back, musing with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or
plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no conclu-
sion ; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was
in the Brazils, thatI knew little of the plants in the field; at
(lleast, very little that might serve to any purpose nowin my
istress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again;
and, after going something further than I had gone the day
before, I found the brook and savannahs cease, and the country
become more woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground, in>>
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees. The vines had
spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were
just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a sur-
prising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I
was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; re-
membering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating
of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves
there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an
excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry
them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are
kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, whole-
some and agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my,
habitation ; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might
Say, I had lain from home. In the night, I took my first
contrivauce, and got up in a tree, where I slept well; and
the next morning proceeded upon my discovery; travelling
nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the
valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills
on the south and north side of me. At the end of this
march, I came to an opening, where the country seemed to
descend to the west; and a little spring 0; fresh water, which
issued out of the side of the hill by 1110, ran the other way,
that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or
flourish of spring, that it looked like is planted garden. I
descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying
it with a. secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other
afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own ; that I
fives king and lord of all this country indefensihl y, and had a
"right of possession; and, if I could convey it, I might have it
,3; inheritance as completelyas any lord of a manor in England.
I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange, and lemon, and
citron-trees; but all wild, and very few hearing any fruit, at
least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found new I
had business enough, to gather and carry home; and I re-
solved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limos and
lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew
was approaching. In order to do this, I gathered a great heap
of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a
great parcel of limes and lemons in another place ; and taking
a few of each with me, I travelled homewards; resolving to
come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to
carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in
this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and
my cave); but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled;
the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having
broken them and bruised them, they were good for little or
nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring
but a. few. .
The next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having?
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I
was surprised, when coming to my heap of grapes, which wen '
so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find them all spread
shout, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I con-
cluded there were some wild creatures thereshouts, which
had done this; but what they were I knew not. However,
as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no
cerrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would
be destroyed, and the other way they would he crusted with
their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out
branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the
sun 3 and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back
as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure the fruitfnlness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on
that side the water, and the wood: and concluded that I
had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by far
the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to
consider of removing my habitation, and looking out for a
place equally safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in
that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exweding fond
of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me;
but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I
was now by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my advantage ; and, by the same
ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other un'
happy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to
inclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of
the island was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such
an afiair not only improbable, but impossible; and that there-
fore I ought not by any means to remove. However, I was
so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time
there for the whole of the remaining part of the month of
July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and sur-
rounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled between
with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or
three nights together; always going over it with a ladder ;
so that I fancied now I had my country house and my sea-
coast house; and this work took me up to the beginning of
A at. .

uIguhad but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy
my labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick
elm to my first habitation; for though I had made me a
tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it
very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep mefrom storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished

my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August,
I found the grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began
to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy
that I did so, for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my white!
food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them"
No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most of
them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and from
hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or
less, every day till the middle of October; and sometimes
so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for
several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase
of my family; I had been concerned for the loss of one of
my cats, who ran away from me, or, us I thought, had
been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my
astonishment, she came home about the end of August,
with three kittens. This was the more strange to me,'
because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it,.with
my gun, yet I thought it was quite a different kind from
our European cats; but the young cats were the same kind
of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being
females, I thought it very strange. But from these three
cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I
was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild boasts, and to
drive them from my house as much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be}
much wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened,
for food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat;
and- the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was regu-
lated thus :--I ate a. bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a
piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner,
broiled; for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to
boil or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle's eggs
for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover bv the rain. I
I

worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and

by degrees worked it on towards one side, till. I mine to

the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out, which

came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out

this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open;

for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a. perfect

inclosure; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed, and open;
for anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not per-

ceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest -
creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.

Sept. 30,--I was now come to the unhappy anniversary
of my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and
found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty--five
days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart
for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground
with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to
God, acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and
praying to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ;
and not having tasted the least refreshment for twelve
hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate 9.
biscuit'ceke and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed,
finishing the day as I began it. I had all this time
observed no Ssbbathday; for as at first I had no sense of
religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,'omitted to
distinguish the weeks, by making a. longer notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know
what any of the days were; but now, having cast up the
days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I
divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for
s. Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I
had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little after
this, my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself to
use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a. daily
memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience
before I had it, and this I sm going to relate was one of
the most discouraging experiments that I made.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of
barley and rice, which I hsd so surprisingly found spring
u , as I thought, of themselves, and I believe there were
a ut thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley;
and now I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the
rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from
me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I
could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two
parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was sowing, it casually!
occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at
first, because I did not know when was the proper time for
it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a
handful of each. It was a. great comfort to me afterwards
that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time
came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till
the wet season had come again, and then it gl'CW as if it
had been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not
grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I
sought for a. moister piece of ground to make another trial
in, and I dug up a. piece of ground near my new bower,
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before
the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly,
and yielded a very good crep; but having part of the seed
left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but
a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment I
was made master of my business, and knew exactly when
the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two
seed times and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains
't'ere over, and the weather began to settle, which was
tbout the month of November, I made a. visit up the
country to my bower, where, though I had not been some
months, yet I found all things just as I left them. The
circle or double hedge that I had made was not only firm
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some
trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown
with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually
shoots the first year after lapping its head. I could not
tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.
1 was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow: and I pruned them, and led them up to
grow as much alike as I eould; and it is scarce credible
how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so
that though the hedge made a. circle of about twenty-five
yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call
them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufii
cient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me,
resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like -
this, in a semi-circle round my wall (I mean that of my
first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes
in a. double row, at about eight yards distance from my
first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence
also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally
be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but
into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were
generally thus :--

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half
of April--rainy, the sun being then on or near the equinox.

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July,
and the half of August--dry, the sun being then to the
north of the Line. '

The half of August, the whole of September, and the
half of October-rainy, the sun being then come back.

The half of October, the whole of November, December,
and January, and the half of February--dry, the sun being
then to the south of the Line.

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as
the winds happened to blow, but this was the general
observation I made. After I had found, by experience.
the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as
much as possible during the wet months. This time I
found much employment, and very suitable also to the
time, for I found great occasion for many things which I
had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and
constant application; particularly I tried many ways to
make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It' 126 urn AND Anvm'ronns

proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was
a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket -
maker's, in the town where my tether lived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are,

very oficious to help, and a. great observer of the manner
in which they worked those things, and sometimes lending
t hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the
nethods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials,

when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree

from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be

as tough as the sallows. willows, and osiers in England,

and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day I went

to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some of

the smaller twigs, 1 found them to my purpose as much as

1 could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared

with a. hatchet to cut down a. quantity, which I soon

found, for there was great plenty of them. These I set up

to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they wore {it

for use, I carried them to my cave; and here, during the

next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I

could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth or to

mrry or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though I

did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them

sulficiently serviceable for my purpose; and thus, after-

wards, I took care never to be without them; and as my

wicker-ware decayed, I made more, especially strong deep

baskets to place my corn in, instead of socks, when I

should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a. world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that
was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of
rum, and some glass bottles--some of the common size.
and others which were case bottles, square, for the holding
of water, spirits, the. I had not so much as a pot to boil
anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the
ship, and which was too big for such as I desired it, viz. to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second
thing I fziin would have haul was a. tobacco-pipe, but it was
impossible to me to make one; however, I found a con-
trivunce for that, too, at last. I employed myself in plant-
ing my second rows of stakes or piles, and in this wicker-
working all the summer or dry season, when another husinees
took me up more time than it could be imagined I could
spare.

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the
whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so
on to where I built my bower, and where I had an opening
quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now
resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that
side; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a,
finger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with twd
biscuit-cakes and a. great bunch of raisins in my pouch for
my store, I began my journey. When I had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view
of the sea to the west, and it being a very clear day, I
fairly descried laud--whether an island or a continent ]
could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from the
W'. to the W.S. W. at a very great distance; by my guess it
could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues oil.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America, and,
as I concluded, by all my observations, must be near the
Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages,
where, if I had landed, I had been ins. worse condition than
I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered
everything for the best; I say I quieted my mind with this,
and left oii' afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being
there.

Besides, after some thought upon this aflair, I considered
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one
time or other, see some vessel pass or rcpass one way or other;
but if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spaniel
country and Brazils, where are found the worst of savages;
for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder
and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island where I now was much
pleasanter than mine--the open or savanna]: fields sweet,
adoined with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods.
I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one,
if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak
to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot:
for I knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it-
I brought it home ; but it was some years beioreI could make
him speak ; however, at last, I taught him to call me by name
very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though. i'
be a. trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes;
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met
with. nor could I satisfy myself to out them, though I killed
several. But 1 had no need to be venturous, for I had no
want of food, and of that which was very good, too, especially
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise,
which, added to my gmpes, Leadenhall-mnrket could not have
furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company;
and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great
cause for thankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities
for food, but had rather plenty, even to dointies.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and
returns to see what discoveries I could make, that I came
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down all
night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild
creature could come at me without waking me.

As soon as I czune to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island,
for here, indeed, the shore was covered with innumerable
turtles, whereas on the other side I had found but three in a
your and a. half. Flore was also an infinite number of fowls of
many kinds, sumo. whivh 1 had seen. and some which I had not
seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as ]
knew not the names of, (\XCL'PI} those called penguins.

I could luwo shut as many as I pleased, but was very
sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind
to kill a she'gout, if I could, which I could better feed on;
and though there were many goats here, more than on my side
the. island, yet it was with much more difliculty that I could
come near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw
me much sooner than when 1 was on the hills.

I confess this side of the. country was much pleasunter than
mine: but yt't I had not the least inclination to remove, for
as I was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me, and
I seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a
journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelie
miles, and then setting up a. great pole upon the shore for a
mark, I concluded I would go home again, and that the next
journey I took should be on the other side of the island east
from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post again.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking
.I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that
'I could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the
country ; but I found myself mistaken, for, being come about
two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very large
valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered
With wood, that I could not see which was my way by any
direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew
very well the position of the sun at that time of the day. It
happened, to my further misfortune, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and not
being able to see the sun, I wondered about very uncomfort-
ably, and at last was obliged to find the see--side, look for my
post, and come back the same day I went: and then, by easy
journeys, I turned homewurd, the weather being exceeding
hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things,
very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it
home if 1 could, for I had often been musing whether it
might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and
'shot should be all spent. I made a. collar for this little
creature. and with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn,
which I always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some dilliculty, till I came to my bower, and there I
inulosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at
home, from whence I had been absent above a. month.

1 cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This
little wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had
been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and

, I180 m m Anvmmn

it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I re-
'solved I would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.

1 I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which, most of the time was
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my I'oll,
who began now to be a. mere domestic, and to be well ac-
quainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid
which I had pgmned in within my little circle, and resolved
to go and fete it home, or give it some food; accordingly I
went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get
out, but was almost starved for want of food. I went and
out boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could
find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did
before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry,
that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like
a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that
time one of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island,
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been infi-
nitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks
that God had been pleased to discover to me that it was
possible I might be more happyin this solitary condition than
I should have been in the liberty of society and in all the
pleasures of the world; that He could fully make up to my
the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human
society, by His presence and the communications of His grace
to my soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to
depend upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal
presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy this life I new led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part 05 my days; and now I changed both my sorrows
and my joys 3 my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what
they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years
t.
pasBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for,
viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart1
would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains
the deserts I was in, and how I was 9. prisoner, locked up witl
,the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited!
wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the great-l
est composure of my mind, this would break out upon me like
i. storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a. child.
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together; and this was still worse
to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by
words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself,
would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts:

I daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of
it to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, " I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee." Immediately it occurred that these words
were to me; why else should they be directed in such a man-
ner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my con-
dition, as one forsaken of God and moral " Well, then," said
I, " if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can
it be, or what matters it, though the world should all forsake
me, seeing on the other hand, if I had ell_the world, and should
lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
'oomperison in the loss? "

' From this moment, I began to conclude in my mind, that it
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary
condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in
any other particular state in the world ; and with this thought
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this
place, -I know not what it was, but something shocked my.
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words
"How must thou become such a. hypocri ," said I, even
uudibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a. condition, which.
however thou mayest endeavour tn be contented wizth, thou

I.132 mm>>: .\.\'D now-:urmu-rs

wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from? " So I
stopped there ; but; though I could not; say I thanked God for
being there, yet. I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening
my eyes, by whatever alllicting providences, to see the former
condition of my life. and to mourn for my wickedness, and
repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut; it, but my very
soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in Eng>>
i-ind, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my
goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third
year ; and though I have not; given tho reader the trouble of
so particular an account of my works this year as the first. ;
yet in general it; may be observed, that I was very seldom
idle, but, having regularly divided my time according to the
several daily employments that; were before me. sueh as. first,
my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures. which I con-
stantly set: apart some time for, thrice every do r; secondly,
the going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took
me up three hours in every morning, when it did not 'ain ;
thirdly, the ordering. cut-ting, preserving, and cooking, what;
I had killed or caught for my supply: these took up great;
put- of tho day. Also, it. is to he considered, that. in the
middle of the day. when the sun was in the zenith, the vio-
lence of tho heat; was too great to stir out _: so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to
work in. with this except-ion. that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and wont to work in the
morning. and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may he
added the exceeding lahorionsness of my work: the many
hours which for want of tools. want of help, and want 0."
skill, everything I did tool: up out of my time. For example,
I was full two and fort-y days in making a heard for a long-
hhelf, which I wanted in my care : whereas. two mwyors, with
their tools and a saw-pit. would have cut. six of them out of
the same tree in half a day.

My case was this: it; was to he a large tree which was tr.
be out down, because my board was to be a broad one. This
tree I was three days in cutting down, and two more cutting
off the houghs, and reducing, it to a. log, or piece of timber.
With inexprossible hacking and hcwing, I reduced both the
SFdes Inf it into chips till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat. as
a board from end to end ; then, turning that side downward,
out the other side fill I brought; the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge

 

musc- IS 00!")!!le BY ms Hill.

the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour
and patience carried me through that, and many other things.
I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so
much of my time Went away with so little work, viz. that134 Mrs AND Anvrzm'unas

what might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a
vast labour and required a prodigious time to do alone, and
by hand. But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour
1 got through everything that my circumstances made neces-
sary to me to do, As will appear by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December, ex:
posting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
mauurcd and dug up for them was not great; for, as I 01>>
served, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a
peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season. But now my crop promised very well, when on a,
sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarcely possible to keep
from it ; as, first the goats, and wild creatures which I called
hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night
and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for but by making an inclosure about
it with a hedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and
the more, because it required speed. However, as my arable
land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well
fem-ed in about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the
creatures in the day time, I set my dog to guard it in the
night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would
stand and bark all night long; so ina little time, the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well,
and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when
it was in the ear; for, going along by the place to see how it
throvo, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I knoij'
not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till \.
should be gone. I immediately let fly among them, for I
always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved,
and never be able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I
could not tell ; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the
first place. I went among it, to see what damage was already
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that
as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great
but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could
be saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, 1
could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about
me. as if they only waited till I was gone away, and the event
proved it to be so ; for as I walked 03, as if I was gone, 1
,was no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped down one
by one into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could
not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that!
every grain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a
peck-loaf to me in the consequence; but coming up to the
hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This was
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them as
we serve notorious thieves in England--hanged them in
chains, for a. terror to others. It is impossible to imagine
that this should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls
would not only not come at the corn, but, in short, they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter
end of December, which was our second harvest of the year,
I reaped my corn.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of
one of the broadswords, or outlasses, which I saved among
the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop was but
small, '1 had no great difiiculty to cut it down; in short, I
reaped it in my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and
carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my
harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed I had
near two bushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of
barley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at '
that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and 1
foresaw that, in time, it would please God to supply me with
bread; And yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither
knew how to grind, or make meal of my corn, or indeed, how
to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not bow t9
bake it. These things being added to my desire of having a
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all
for seed against the next season; and, in the meantime, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this
great work of providing myself with corn and bread. ,

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.
I believe few people have thought much upon the strange
multitude of little things necessary in the providing, pro--
ducing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article
of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to
my daily discouragement; and was made more sensible of
it every hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-
corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth--no spade or
shovel to dig it. NVell, this I conquered by making me a
wooden spade, as I observed before; but this did my work
but in a. wooden manner ; and though it cost me a great many
days to make it, yet for want of iron, it not only were out
soon, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed
much worse. However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
performance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow,
but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a. great heavy
bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called,
rather than rake or hu'row it. When it was growing, and
grown, I have observed already how many things I wanted to
fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home,

\thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a
mill to grind it, sieve: to dress it, yeast and salt to make it
into bread, and an oven to bake it ; but all these things I did
without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an in
estimable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I
mid, made everything laborious and tedious to me; but that
there N no help for. Neither was my time so much loss to
me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every
day appointed to these works; and as I had resolved to use
none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me,
I had the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour
and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper for the
performing all the operations necessary for making the corn,
when I had it, fit for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I
had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which, when
it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and
required double labour to work with it. However, I got
through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of'
ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind,
and fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which
were all cut off that wood which I had set before, and knew it
would grow ; so that, in a year's time, I knew I should have
a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair.
This work did not take me up less than three months, because
a great part of that time was the wet season, when I could not
go abroad. Within-doors, that is when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment in the following occupations--
always observing, that all the while I was at work, I diverted
myself with talking to my pmot, and teaching him to speak;
and I sickly taught him to know his own name, and at last
to spea it out pretty loud, " Poll," which was the first word
I ever heard spoken in the island by any month but my own.
This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistance to my
work ; for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my
hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some means
or other, some earthen, vessels, which, indeed, I wanted sorely,
but knew not where to come at them. However, considering
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find
out any clay, I might make some pets that might, being dried
in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to hear handling,
and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal,
&c., which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to
hold what should be put into them.

' It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me,
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste;
'what odd, mis shapen, ugly things I made; how many of
them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stifi
.enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and
how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well before138 mm: mm .mvzx'mmts

as after they were dried: and, in a. word, how, after having
laboured hard to find the clay--to dig it, to temper it, to
bring it home. and work it--I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things (1 cannot call them jars) in about

two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked theme two very dry and hard,-
I lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two
great wicker-baskets, which I had made on purpose for them,
that they might not break; and as between the.pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stud-ed it full of the
rice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps
the meal, when the corn was bruised. '

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success; such as
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any
things my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked
them quite hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get
an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire--
which none of these could do. It happened after some time,
making :1. pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went
to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece
of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as
a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see
it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to
burn whole, if they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters
burn in, or of glazin them with lead, though I had some lead
to do it with; but placed three large pipkins, and two or
three pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood
all round it with a. great heap of embers under them. I plied
the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top,
till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw them
clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours,
till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or
run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by

\the violence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I
(had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots
began to abate of the red colour; and, watching them all
night, that I might not let ,the fire abate too fast, in the
'morning I had three very good (I will not say handsome)
pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could
be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the running
of the sand. -

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no
sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to
the shapes of them, they were very indiflerent, as any one
may suppose. when I had no way of making them but as the
children 'make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies that
never learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pet that would
bear the tire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they
were cold before 1 set one on the fire again, with some water
in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well ; and
with a piece of a kid 1 made some very good broth, though
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite tc
make it as good as I would have had it been.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or
heat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought
of arriving at that perfection of art with one pair of hands.
To supply this want, I was at a great loss ; for, of all the
trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a
stone cutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any tools to
go about it with. I spent many a day to find out a great
stone big enough to cut hollow, and make (it for a mortar,
and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness suflicient, but were all of
a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would hear the weight
of a heavy pestle, nor would break the com without filling it
with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in searching
for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier;
and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it,
and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and
then, with the help of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow
place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After
this, I made a great heavy pestle, or heater, of the wood
called the iron wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against
I had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to
grind, or rather pound, into meal. to make bread.

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or scarce, to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk ; without
which I did not see it possible 1 could have any bread. This
was a most difiicult thing, even to think on, for to be sure
-I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it--I mean
fine thin canvas or stuff to scarce the meal through. And
here I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really
know what to do. Linen I had none left but what was more
rags; I had goat's-hair, but neither knew how to weave it or
spin it; and had I known how, here were no tools to work it
with. All the remedy that I found for this was, that at last
I did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes which were
saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;
and with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper

' enough for the work; and thus I made shift for some years:
how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn 3 for,
first, I had no yeast. As to that part, there was no supplying
the want, so I did not concern myself much about it. But
for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I found
out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say,
about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep.
These I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid
them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles,
of my own baking and burning also; but I should not call
them square.

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers,
or live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to
cover it all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was
very hot. Then, sweeping away all the embers, I set down
my leaf or leaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upon
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in and add to the heat; and time, as well as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became, in
little time, a good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made
myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but I made no
pies, neither had I anything to put into them, supposing I
had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

, It need not he wondered at if all these things took me up

Imost part of the third year of my abode here; for, it is to be
observed that in the intervals of these things I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage; for I reaped my corn in
its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it
up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it
out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash
it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it
up in. for the increase 0! tho corn now yielded me so much,
that. I had of the barley about twenty bushels. and of tho
rice as much. or more: iusmnuch that now I resolved to begin
to use it freely: for my hroarl had boon quite gone a grout.

she did at first, but not quite ; and was turned, by the force oi
the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high
ridge of henchy, rough sand, but no water about her. If I
had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched
her into the water, the heat would have done well enough,
and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily
enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more
:turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could
wolnovn the island; however. I went to the woods, and cut
luv-rs and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving
to try what I could do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could
but turn her down, I might repair the damage she had re-
mind, and she would be a. very good beat, and I might go to
sea. in her very easily.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, 1 think, three or four weeks about it; at last, finding
it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it
fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right
in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again,
or to get under it. much less to move it forward towards the
water; so I was forced to give it over; and yet, though I
gave over the hopes of the beat, my desire to venture over for
the main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible.

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not
possible to make myself a canoe, or wriaguu, such as the
natives of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I
might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree.
This I not only thought ssible, but easy, and pleased my-
self extremely with the t oughts of making it, and with my
having much more convenience for it than any of the Negroes
or Indians; but not at all considering the particular inoon
venicnccs which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz
want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the water--
>>. difiiculty much harder for me to surmount than all the con-1
sequences of want of tools could be to them ; for what wasi
to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and
with much trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my.
tools to hew and duh the outside into the proper shape of a
boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it bellow, so
as to make a boat of it--if, after all this, I must leave it.

One would have. thought I could not. have had the least
rolloct-ion upon my mind of my circumstances while I wua
making this hoot, but. I should have immmliatel)r thought how
I should get it into the sea : but. my thoughts were so intent;
upon my voyage ovor the sea in it), that. I never once conu'.
sidored how I should get. it oil, the land : and it was really, in
its own nature. more easy for me to guide it; over forty-tire
miles in soa. than about. fort-y~ti\'e fathoms of land, where it
lay. to sot: it alloat in the water.

I wont to work upon this boat the most. like a fool that over
man did who had any of his senses. awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining whether 1 was ever able
to undertake it: not. but. that the dillieult-y of launching my
boat came often into my head; but I put a stop to my in--
quirios into it. by this foolish answer, which I gave myself :
" Lot. mo first make it: ] warmnt- I will find some way or
other to get, it along when it is done."

This was a most prelmstorous method ; but. the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I tolled a cedar-
troe. and 1 question mueh whet-her Solomon ever had such a.
one for the building of the Temple of Jerusalem; it- was five
toot ton inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and
four fuel: eleven inches diamete' at, the end of twentytwo

branches. It was not. without infinite labour that. 1 fellvd
this tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at- it; at- the

delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than
ever I saw a. canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree,
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be
sure ; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no ques-
tion but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the
. most unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.

' But all my devices to get it into the waiter failed me;
though they cost me infinite labour too. It lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the first
inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to
take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the

surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began.-
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge
pains who have their deliverance in view'l) ; but when this
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was still
much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I
could the other boat. Then I measured the distance of
ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the
water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work; and when I

began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to be
' ' R

..u.>>--..146 mm: mm raver-mass

dug, how broad, how the stud was to be thrown out, I found
that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own,
it must have been ten or twelve years before I could have
gone through with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the
upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt
over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the fol'y of beginning a work before we count the cost,
and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through
with it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion,
and with as much comfort as ever before; for, by a constant
study and serious application to the Word of God, and by the
assistance of His grace, I gained a different knowledge from
what I had before. I entertained difierent notions of things.
I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had
nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no
desires about: in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it,
nor was ever likely to have; so I thought it looked, as we
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived
in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as Father
Abraham to Dives, " Between me and thee is a. great gulf
fixed."

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness
of the world here; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the
lusts of the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet,
for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying; I was lord
of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself

= king or emperor over the whole country which I had possession
of : there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute
sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised ship-
loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little
grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or
turtle enough, but now and then one was as much as I could
put to any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of
ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to
have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had
been built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I
had enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all
the rest to me! If I killed more flesh than I could eat,
the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more corn than
I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down
were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use
of them but for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to
dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to
me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world
are no farther good to us than they are for our use; and that,
whatever we may heap up to give others, we enjoy just as
much as we can use, and no more. The most oovetous,
griping miser in the world would have been cured of the
vice of covetousness, if he had been in my case; for I
possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I
had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had
not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use
to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as
well gold as silver. about thirtysix pounds sterling. Alas!
there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business
for it; and often thought with myself, that I would have
given a handful of it for a gross of tobaccopipes; or for a
hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all
for a sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England,
or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As
it was, I had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it;
but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp
of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the drawer
full of diamonds, it had been the same case, they had been
of no manner of value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in
itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as
well as to my body. I frequently sat down to meat with
thankfulness, and admixed the hand of God's providence,
which had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned
to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather
than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret
comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take
notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them,
because they see and covet something that he has not given
them. All our discontents about what we want appszeared to

x
the to spring from the want of thankfuluess for what we
ave.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as
mine was; and this was, to compare my present condition
with what I at first expected it would be ; nay, with what it
would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the
)shore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort;
without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for
defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing
to myself, in the most lively colours, how I must have acted
if I had got nothing out of the ship. How I could not have
so much as get any food, except fish and turtles; and that,
as it was long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first 5 that I should have lived, if I had not perished,
like a more savage ; that if I had killed a. goat or a fowl, by
any contrivanco, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the
flash from the skin and the bowels, or to out it up; but must
gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a
beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition,-
with all its hardships and misfortunes: and this part also I
cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are. apt.
in their misery, to say, " Is any affliction like minel": Let
them consider how much worse the cases of some people
are, and their case. might have been, if Providence had
thought fit. , '

1 haul another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was comparing my present
situation with what I had: deserved, and had therefore mison
to expect from the hand-of Providence. I had lived a dread.
lul life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and four of God,
I had been well instructed by futher'und mother; neither had
they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse
:i religious awe of God into my mind, a. sense of my duty,
and what the nature and end of my being required of me.
But, alas! falling early into the seafaring life which, of all:
lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God. though His
or sonmsos causes. 149

terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the
seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little sense
of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me
by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and
the views of death, which grew habitual to me by my long
absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with
anything but what was like myself, or to hear anything that '
was good or tended towards it.

So void was I of everythi thatwas good, or the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest
deliverances I enjoyed--such as my escape from Sallee; my
being taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship; my
being planted so well in the Brazils; my receiving the cargo
from England, and the like--I never had once the words,
" Thank God," so much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor
in the greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray to
him, or so much as to say, " Lord, have mercy upon me!"
no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear
by, and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months,
as I have already observed, on account of my wicked and
hardened life past; and when I looked about me, and con-
sidered what particular providences had attended me since my
coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully
with me--had not only punished me less than my iniquity
had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me--this
gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
that God had yet mercy in store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to
a resignation to' the will of God in the present disposition of
my circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my
condition; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not
to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason ta
have expected in that place; -that I ought never more to
repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily
thanks fer that daily bread; which nothing but a crowd of
wonders could have brought; that I ought to consider I had
been fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah b ravens; nay, by along series of miracles : and that
I could have named a place in the uninhabi'table part
of the worl where I could have been cast more to my
advantage; 8 place where, as I had no society, which was
my aflliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no
furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous
creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt; no
savages to murder and devour me. In a. word, as my life was
a life of sorrow one way, so it was a. life of mercy another;
and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be
able to make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation ; and after
I did make a just improvement on those things, I went away,
and was no more sud. I had now been here so long, that
many things which I had hrought on shore for my help
were either quite gene, or very much wasted and near
s ent.

I)My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a.
very little, which I ekod out with water, a. little and a. little,
till it was so pale, it source left any appearance of black upon
the paper. As long as it lasted I made use of it to minute
down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me ; and first, by casting up times past, I remem-
bered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the
various providences which hofell me, and which, if I had been
superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate,
I might hare had reason to have looked upon with a great
deal of curiosity.

First, 1 had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Snllee
man-of-war, and made a. slave ; the same day of the your that
I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads,
that same day year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee
in a. boot; the same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
30th of September, that same day;I had my life so mira-
culously saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore
in this island; so that my wicked life and my solitary life
began both on a day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread, 1 mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship;
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but
one cake of bread a day for above a year ; and yet I was
quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had
any at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had
none 9. good while, except some chequered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I care-
fully preserved; because many times I could bear no other
clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick
watchcoats of the seamen's which were left, but they were too
hot to wear; and though it is true that the weather was so
violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could
not go quite naked--no, though I had been inclined to it,
which I was not ;--nor could I abide the thought of it,
though I was alone. The reason why I could not go naked
was, I could not hear the heat of the sun so well when quite
naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the very heat frequently
blistered my skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself
made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold
cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to
go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat ; the heat
of the sun, heating with such violence as it does in that place,
would give me the head-ache presently, by darting so directly
on my head. without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear
it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order; I had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now
to try if I could not make jackets out of the great watchcoats
which I had by me, and with such other materials as I had;
so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed, batching, for I
made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make
two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me
a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very
sorry shift indeed till afterwards

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung
up, stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some
of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but
others were very useful. The first thing I made of these was
a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot
in the rain ; and this I performed so well, that after. I made
me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins--that is to say, a
waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for
they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a
worse tailor. However, they were such as I made very good
shift with, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the
hair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept
Very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to mnkr~
an umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a
great mind to make one: I had seen them made in the
Brazils, where they are very useful in the great heats there,
and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be
much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the
rains as the heats. I took a world of pains with it, and was
a great while before 1 could make anything likely to hold:
nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three
before I made one to my mind : but at last I made one that
answered indiiferently well; the main difficulty I found was
to make it let down. I could make it spread, but if it did
not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do. However,
at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with
skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-
house, and kept ofi' the sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than
1 could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it,
could close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed by resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing
.myself wholly upon the disposal of His providence. This made
my life better than sociable, for when I began to regret the
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus
conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I
may say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the
world '1

I cannot say that, after this, for five years, any extraor~
dinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same
:onrse. in the same posture and place, as before; the chief
things 1 was employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I
always kept up just enough to have sufiicient stock of one
year's provision beforehand ; I say, besides this yearly labour.
and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one
labour, to make a canoe, which at last I finished : so that, by
digging acanal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a. mile. As for the first,
which was so vastly big, for I made it without considering
beforehand, as 1 ought to have done, how I should be able to
launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was
as a. memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time:
indeed, the next time, though I could not get a. tree proper for
it, and was in a place where I could not get the water to it at
any less distance than, as I have said, near hall a mile, yet, as
I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my
labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all. answerable to the design which I had
in view when I made the first ; I mean of venturing over to
the tewa flrnm, where it was above forty miles broad; accord-
ingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. As Ihad a beat,
my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as
I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that little journey made me very eager to see other parts of
the coast; and now 1 had a' boat, I thought of nothing but
sailing round the island. ,

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and
made a sail too out of some of .the pieces of the ship's soils
which lay in store, and of which I had a great stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boot, I found
she would sail very well : then ,I made little lockers, or
boxes, at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries,
ammunition, <<to. into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the
spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the
inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap
to hang down over it, to keep it dry. -
I fixed my umbrella also in a. step at the stern, like a. mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me,
like an awning g. and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea : but never went far out, nor for from the
little creek. At last, being eager to view the circumference of
my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise; and accordingly
I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley broad, an
earthen pot full of parched rice (:1 food I ate a great deal of)
a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot im
killing more, and two large mttchAcoats, of those which, as I
mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests;
those I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the
night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign----
or my captivity, which you please--that l set out on this
voyage. and 1 found it much longer than I expected ; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came
to the east side of it, I found a. great ledge of rocks lie out
about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some under
it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league
more, so that I was obliged to go a. great way out to sea tc
double the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea: and, above all, doubting how I
should get back again: so I came to an anchor; for I had
made A kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling
which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where
I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture. g

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per g
ceived a strong and, indeed, a. most furious current, which ran
to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger
that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the
strength of it. and notbe able to make the island again: and
indeed, had 1 not get first upon this hill, I believe it would
have been so; for there was the some current on the other
side the island, only that it set 011' at a farther distance, and
I saw there was ash-orig eddy under the shore; so I had
nothing to do but to get out of the first current, and I should
presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E.S.E.,and that being justcontraryto the current,
made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too clam to the shore for the breach,
nor to go too far ofi, because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a
warning to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I
come to the point, when I was not even my boat's length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and
a current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along
with it with such violence that all I could do could not keep
her so much as on the edge of it 3 but I found it hurried me
farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my
left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I
could do with my paddles signified nothing : and now I began
to give myself over for lost; for as the current was on both
sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did
I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect
before me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water,
that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was all this
to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there
was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand
leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse.
Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island, as the
most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my
heart could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched
out my hands to it, with eager wishes: " 0 happy desert! "
said I, " I shall never see thee more. 0 miserable creature!
whither am I going?" Then I reproached myself with my
unthankiul temper, and that I had repined at my solitary
condition; and now what would I give to be on shore there
again 1 Thus, we never see the true state of our condition till
it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value156. LIFE no anvnxn'nns or nonmsox rm'son.

what. we enjoy. hut hy the want of it. It: is searcely possible
to imagine the consternation l was. now in.heing driven from my
beloved island (For so it, appeared to me now to be) into the
wide oer- n. almost two leagues, and in the utmost, despair of
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard till indeed
my strength was almost exhausted. and kept my boat as much
to the northward. that. is. towards the side of the current,
whieh the eddy lay on. as possibly 1 could : when about. noon.
as the sun passed the meridian. I thought I felt a little hreeze
of wind in my fare. springing up from 8.8.13" This cheered
my heart a little. and especially when. in about half an hour
morn. it blew a. pretty gentle gale. By this time, I had got at.
a frightful distance lrom the island. and had the least cloudy
or hazy weather intervenml. 1 had been undone another way,
too: for I had no compass on hoard. and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I had but
once lost sight of it: hut. the weather continuing clear, 1
appliod myself to get up my mast. again. and spread my sail.
standing m ay to the north as much as possihlo. to get out of
the current.

Just as 1 had set my mast and sail. and the boat: hogan to
siren-h away. I saw even by the rloaruess of the water some
alteration of the current was near: for where the current. was
so strong the water was foul : but perceiving the water clear,
1 found the current abate : and presently .1 found to the. eas
at about half a mile. a. ln'ezh'h of the sea upon some rocks.
these rocks] found caused the. current to part again, and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly. leaving the
rocks to the north-east. so the other returned by the repulse
of the rocks. and made a strong eddy. which ran back again
to the north--west. with a very sharp stream.

They who know What it. is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder. or to be rescued from thieves just going
to murder them. or who have been in such extremities, may
guess what. my present surprise of joy was. and how gladly I
put- my boat- into the stream of this eddy : and the wind also
froshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it. running cheer-
fully before the wind. and with a strong tide or eddy under
icon.

This eddy carried me. about. a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island. but about, two leagues more to the
northward than the current which carried me away at first ;cuuaon RETURNS rmn ['03 His DBLIVKBANCSurn sun moans or noemsou causoe. 159

no that when I came near, the island, I found myself open to
the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the
island, opposite to that which I went out fro .

When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and
served me no farther. However, I found that being between
two great currents, viz. that on the south side, which had
hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about a
league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the
wake of the island, I found the water at least still, and run-
ning no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I
kept on steering directly for the island, though not making
such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
occasioned this disaster, stretching out, as is described before,
to the southward, and casting off the current more southerly,
had, of course, made another eddy to the north; and this I
found very strong, but not directly setting the way my course
lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However,
having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west; and in about an hour came within abouts mile of
the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts
of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with
such things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a
little cove that Ihad spied under some trees, and laid me down
to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat! I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and
what might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures: so
I resolved on the next morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if
I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, . coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a. mile 1
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or
_brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat. -
and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on.
purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat
very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where I
was. '

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for
it was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, am.
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing standing as I left it ; for I always kept it in good order,
being, as I said before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be
in when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling
me by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe:
poor Robin Crusoe I Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
are you? Where have you been? "

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or
paddling as it is called, the first part of the day, and with
walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ; but
dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that
somebody spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat,
" Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," at last I began to wake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started
up in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes
open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge ; and
immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in
such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach
him; and he had learned it so perfectly that he would sit
upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry,
"Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you
been'l How came you here i" and such things as I had
taught him. '

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could he nobody else, it was a good while before I
could-compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature
got thither 3 and then, how he should just keep about the place,
and nowhere else; but as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest Poll, ,I got over ityand holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, "Poll," the sociable creature
came to me, and set upon my thumb, as he used to do, and
continued talking to me, " Poor Robin Crusoe l and how did I
come here! and where had I been?" just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again, and so I carried him home along
with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and
had enough to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon
the danger I had been in. I would have been veryg glad to
have had my boat again on my side of the island ; but I knew
not how it was practicable to get itabout. .As to the east side'
of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way 5 my very heart would
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it ; and
as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it might
be there; but supposing the current ran with the same force
against the shore at the east as it seed by it on the other, I
might run the same risk of being riven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as I had been before of being carried away
from it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without
any boat, though it had been the product of so many months'
labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year;
and lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ,
and my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condi-
tion, and fully comforted 1n resigning myself to the dispositions
of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all
things, except that of society.

I improved myself' in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying my self to; and I
believe I should, upon occasion, have made a very good car
penter, especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unex cted perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enoug to make them with a;
wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better; because I
made things round and shaped, which before were filthy things
indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vein of my own
performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than for
my being able to make a tobacco-p pipe; and though it was a
very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned
red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it.
for I had been always used to smoke 5 and there were pipes in

. 1:
the ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking there was
tobacco in the island ; and afterwards, when I searched the
ship again, I could not come at any pipes.

In my wickerware, also, I improved much, and made abund-
ance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed
me; though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for laying things up in, or fetching
things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could
hang it up in. a. tree, ilay it, dress it, and out it in pieces, and
bring it home in a. basket; and the like by a turtle 2 I could
cut it up. take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh,
which was enough for me, and bring them home in a. basket,
and leave the rest behind me. Also. large deep baskets were
the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out as
soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably;
this was a. want which it was impossible for me to supply, and
I beg-in seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I should kill any
goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year of my being
here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in
hopes of getting a he'goat : but I could not by any means
bring it to pass till my kid grew an old goat ; and as I could
never find in my heart to kill her, she died at last of mere
age.

But being new in the eleventh year of my residence, and,
as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I
could not catch some of them alive; and particularly, I wanted
a. she-goat great with young. For this purpose I made snares
to hamper them ; and I do believe they were more than once
taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for Iliad no wire,
and I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At
'length, I resolved to try n. pitfall : so I dug several large pits
in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used to
feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles, of my own making
too, with a. great weight upon them ; and several times I put
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the
com, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set
three traps in one night, and going the next morning I found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone :_ this was
very discouraging. However, I ultemd my traps ; and, not to
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see my
traps, I found in one of them a large old lie-gout ; and in one
of the others, three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was
so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
killed him, but that was not my business, nor would it answer
my end; so I even let him out, and he ran away as if he had
been frightened out of his wits. But I did not then know
what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a. lion. If
1 had let him stay there three or four days without food, and
then have carried him some water to drink, and then a little
corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they
are gnighty sugacious, tractable creatures, where they are well
use .

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that time: then I went to the three kids, and, taking them
one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some
dilheulty brought them all home.

It was a. good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to he
tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply myself
with goats' flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tnmo was my only way, when, perhaps, I might have
them about my house like a. flock of sheep. But. then, it
occurred to me that I must kee the tame from the wild, or
else they would always run wil when they grew up; and the
only way for this was to have some inclosed piece of ground,
well fenced either with hedge or pole, to keep them in so
effectually, that those within might not break out, or those
without break in. '

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet, as
I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my fire"
work was to find out a. proper piece of ground, where there
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a lace very proper for
all these (being a plain open piece 0 meadow land, "or
suvanneh, as our people call it in the western colonies), which
had two or three little drills of frosh water in it, and2 at one

I.'164 mm .mn Abvnx'runrs

end was very woody,--~I say, they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I began by inc-losing this piece of ground
in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at least
two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to
the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have
time enough to do it in; but I did not consider that my goats
would be as wild in so much compass as if they had had the
whole island, and I should have so much room to chase them
in that I should never catch them.

. My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty
'yards when this thought occurred 'to me ; so I presently
stopped short, and, for the beginning, I resolved to inclose a
piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one
hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so as my stock
increased, I could add more ground to my inclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first
piece ; and, till 1 had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible,
to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand ; so that, after my inclosure was finished, and
I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bloating
after me for a handful of com.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years
more I had three-and'forty, besides several that I took and killed
for my food. After that, I inclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to
take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground
into another. >>

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goats' flesh to
deed on when I pleased, but milk too,--a thing which, indeed,

'in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable
surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how
to make use of it, so I, that. had never milked a cow, much
less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made only when I was a
box. after a great many essays and miscarriages, made both1

or soumsox cnuson. 165

butter and cheese at last, also salt (though I found it partly
made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the
rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How
mercifully can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those
conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in
destruction I How can He sweeten the hitterest providences,
and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons! _

 

CRUSOE DINES WITH HIS FAMILY.

What a table was here spread for me in the wilderness, where
I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger !

It would have made a. Stoic smile to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all
my subjects at my absolute'eommand ; I could hang, draw,
give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all my'
subjects. Then, to see how like a. king I dined, too, all alone, .
attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been mv'166 mm AND snvsxrcnns or nonmsox cur-son.

favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. My
dog, who was now grown old and crazy, and had found no
species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right
hand ; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one on
the other, expecting now and then a. hit from my hand, as a.
mark of especial favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore
at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been in-
terred near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them
having multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these
were two which I had preserved tame ; whereas the rest run
wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at
last, for they would often come into my house, and plunder
me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a
great many; at length they left me. W'ith this attendance
and in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be said
to want anything but society; and of that, some time after
this, I was likely to have much.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards ;
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about
the island, and at other times I sat myself down contented
enough without her. But I had a. strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island where, as I have
said in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had tc
do: this inclination increased upon me every day, and at
length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge
of the shore. I did so ; but had any one in England met such
a. man as I was, it must either have frightened him, or raised
a. great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in
such a. dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure,
as follows :--

I had a. great high shapeless cap, made of agent's skin, with
a. flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me
as to shoot the rain ofi from running into my neck, nothing
being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.'

I had a. short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open~'"TAW/ig
canon 20'?!" m." m m .10le-urn AND snvnurusss or sonmsos csuson. 169

kneed breaches of the same ; the breeches were made of the
skin of an old lie-goat, whose heir hung down ouch n length
on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle
of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me
'a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like
buskins, to flop over my legs, and lace on either side like
spatter-dashes, but of a. most barbarous shape, as indeed were
all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the some instead of buckles, and
' in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a. sword
and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
and one on the other. I had another belt not so brood. and
fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder,
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,
both made of goat's skin too, in one of which hung my
powder, in the other my shot. At my back I carried my
basket, and on my shoulder, my gun, and over my head 3
great clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all,
was the most necessary thing I had about me next to my gun.
As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto like
as one might expect from a. man not at all careful of it, and
living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heard
I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a
yard long ; but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I
had cut it pretty short, exwpt whet grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimmed into 9. large pair of Mnhometan
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks st Sellee,
for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of
these moustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long
.enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length .
:and shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would
have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to
observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say
no more of that. In this kind of dress I went my new
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along
the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my
host to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and having no best
new to take care of, I went over the land a. nearer way to the
same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to
the points of the rocks which lay out, and which] was obliged
to double with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet--no rippling, no motion, no
current, any more there than in any other places. I was at a
strange loss to understand this. and resolved to spend some
time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the
tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it
was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great river on
the shore. must be the occasion of this current, and that!
according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west m

from the north, this current came nearer, or went farther from
the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, 1 went up to
the rock again, and then the title of ebb being made, i plainly
. saw the current again as before. only that it ran farther oll',
being near half a league from the shore, whereas in my case
it set close upon the shore. and hurried me and my canoe
along with it, which at another time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing.r to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and 1 might
very easily bring my heat about the island again ; but when l
hogan to think of putting it in practice, I had such terror
upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger 1 had lm-u
in, that I could not think of it again with any patience. but,
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which wan~ more
safe, though more laborious~ and this was, that I would build,
or rather make, me another periagun. or canoe. and so have one
for one side of the island. and one for the other.

You are to understand. that now 1 had, as I may call it.
two plantations in the island,--one my little fortification or
tent. with the wall about it, under the rock, with the can!
behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into sm-rral
apartments, or caves, one within another. One of those. \\ hivh
E was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my "all
or i'ortilication,~--that is to say, beyond where my wall joined
to the rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of

which 1 have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen
great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, where
I laid up my stores of provisions, especially my corn, some in
the ear, cut 0E short from the straw, and the other rubbed out
with my hand.

As for my well, made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind
them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two ieces of com land,
which I kept duly cultivated and sows , and which duly
yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had
occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as (it as
that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a
tolerable plantation there also; for, first, I had my little
bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair--that is to say, I
kept the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly fitted up to
its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside. I
kept the trees, which at first were no more than stakes, but
were now grown very firm and tall, always out, so that they
might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did efiectually to my mind. In
the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a sail spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and
which never wanted any repair or renewing ; and under this I
had made me a equal) or couch, with the skins of the creatures
] had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved;
and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that
is to say, my goats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of
pains to fence and inclose this ground. I was soanxious to
see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that 1'
never left off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so nearto one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce
room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the inclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger
than any wall.

lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that

than I to this retreat. I
I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occa-
sion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which
is something contrary to the nature of such things, and espe-
cially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear ; but I was
so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that
I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even
though I was now a great way oil. Sometimes I fancied it
must be the devil, and reason joined in with me in this suppo-
sition, for how should any other thing in human shape come174 Li H: AND anrus'ruhss

into the place? \thro was tho Vessel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footstep? And how was
it possible a man should come there? But then, to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for no
purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it,----this
was an amusement the other way. I considered that the
devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have
terrified me than this of the single print of a foot; that as I
lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never
have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it
was ten thoustnd to one whether I should ever see it or not,
and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a
high wind, would have defaced entirely. All this seemed
inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we
usually entertain of the subtilty of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out
of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and 1 presently
concluded then, that it must be some more dangerous creature,
viz. that it must be some of the savages of the main land
opposite, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and
either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had
made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea ; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this
desolate island as 1 would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, 1 was very
thankful in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to he
thereahouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat,
by which they would have concluded that some inhabitant-s
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for
me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about
their having found out my boat, and that there were people
here ; and that, if so, I should certainly have them come again
in greater numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen
that they should not find me, yet they would find my incle-
sure, destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of
tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former
confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful
experience as I had had of His goodness; as if He that had
died rue by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by His power,
the provision which He had made fo' me by His goodness.
I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any
more corn one year than would just serve me till the next
season, as if no accident could intervene to prevent my en:
joying the crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought
so just a leproof, that I resolved for the future to have two or
lhrce years corn beforehand; so that, whatever might come,
I' might not perish for want of bread.

llow strange a choquer-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret different springs are the aflections
hurried about, as different circumstances present! To-day
we love what to-morrow we hate ; to-day we seek what
to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we
fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was
exemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner
iumginable, for I, whose only affliction was that I seemed
banished from human society, that I was alone, circumscribed
by the boundless ooean, cut off from mankind, and condemned
to what I call silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven
thought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to
appear among the rest of His creatures; that to have seen
one of my own species wouldhave seemed to me a raising me
from death to. life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven
itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow.
I say, that I shmld now tremble at the very apprehensions
of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at
but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set hi1
feat in the island. ,

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was I
'the station of life the infinitely. wise and good providence of
. God had determined for me ; that as I could not foresee what
the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not
'to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had
an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as He thought fit; and who, as I was a creature
that had oll'ended Him, had likewise ,a judicial right to-_,eonSS
demn me to what punishment. lie-thought fit; and that it
was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because I
had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who
was not only righteous, but omnipotent, had thought fit thus

. .r. ..... . __
to punish and afflict me, so He was able to deliver me: that
if He did not think fit to do so, it was my unquestioned duty
to resign myself absolutely and entirely to His will; and, on
the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to
Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of
,His daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say weeks and months: and one particular ellect of my
'cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit. One morning
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my
danger from the appearances of savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture
came into my thoughts : " Call upon Me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me." Upon
this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not only
comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly
to God for deliverance: when I had done praying, I took up
my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that pre-
sented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,
and He shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord."
It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. In
answer, 1 thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
sad, at least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might
be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my
beat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own feet; and why might I not come that way from the
boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat? Again I
considered also, that I could by no means tell, for certain;

' where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if, at last"?
this was only the print of my own feet, I had played the part.
of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and appa-
ritions. and then are frightened at them more than an body.

New I began to take courage, and to peep abroa again,
for I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and
nights, so that I began to starve for provisions; for I had
little or nothing within doors but some barley-cakes and
water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too,
which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of
it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with
the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, and that I might be truly said to 'start at my own
shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country
house to milk my flock: but to see with what few I went
forward, how often I looked behind me. how I was ready,
every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run for
'my life, it would have made any one have thought I was
haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately
most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I
went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing,
I began to be a. little bolder, and to think there was really
nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could not per-
made myself fully of this till I should go down to the shore
again, and see this print of a foot. and measure it by my own,
and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be
assured it was my own foot: but when I came to the place---
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts:
secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own
foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both
these things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave
me the vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook
with cold like one in an ague; and I went home again, filled
with the belief that some man or men had been on shore
there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I
might be surprised before I was aware; and what course to
take for my security I knew not.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed
with fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which
reason offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to;
:myself was, to throw down my inclosures, and turn all n'y
"euue cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemy should find
them, and than frequent the island in prospect of the samet
or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my
two corn-fields, lest they should find such a. grain there, and
still be prompted to frequent the island: then to demolish
my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find
out the persons inhabiting.

I

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had
so overrun my mind Were fresh upon me, and my head was
full of vapours. Thus, fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much,
than the. evil which we are anxious about: and what was
worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble that.
from the resignation I used to practise, I hoped to have. I
looked, I thought, like San]. who complained not only that
the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not new take due ways to compose my mind,
by crying to God in my distress. and resting upon llis provi-
dence, as I had done before. for my defence and delireraneo ;
which, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully
supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried
through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ;
but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the mouse-
ment of my mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits
exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better
composed than I had ever been before. And new I began to
think sedati-ly; and, upon debate with myself. I concluded
that this island (which was so exceedingly pleasant. fruitful,
and no farther from the main land than us I had seen) was
not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that although
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds. might come to this place; that I had
lived here. fifteen years now, and had not met with the. least
shadow or figure of any people yet; and that, if at any time
they should be driven here. it was probable they went away
again as soon as over they could, seeing they had never
thought lit to fix here upon any "evasion; that the most I
t-onld suggest :ury danger from was, from any casual acci--
dental landing of struggling people from the main, who, as it
was likely. if they were driven hither. were here against their
wills. so they made no stay here. but went all again with all
lmssible speed : seldom staying one night on shore. lest they
should not have the help of the tides and daylight bark again :
and that. therefore, 1 had nothing to do but to consider of
same safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
t 9 spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock:
upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to drew
me a second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a
distance from my well, just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made
mention: these trees having been planted so thick before,
they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that
they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be
soon finished. So that I had now a double wall; and my
outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and everything I could think of, to make it strong; having
in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm
out at. In the inside of this, I thickened my wall to about
ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my
cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on
shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon, and
fitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so
that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time;
this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet
never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes or
sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as
they could well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might set
in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees,
if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 1

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and in five
or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing
so monetrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly
impassable: and no men, of what kind soever, could ever
imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habi-
tation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in
and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders,

one to a part of the rock which was low, and then b2roke in.
~ 34
and loft. room to place another ladder upon that; so when the
two ladders were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had come
down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus 1 took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that .
they were not altogether without just reason ; though ]'
fm-isaw nothing at that time more than my more fem
suggested to mo.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats: they were not only a ready supply to me on
every occasion, and hogan to he suilicieut for me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of
hunting after the wild ones : and I was loath to lose the advan-
tago of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of
but two ways to preserve them : one was, to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them
into it every night ', and the other was to ineleso two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened
to the flock in general. I might be able to raise them again
with little trouble and time: and this, though it would require
a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as
private. indeed, as my heart could wish: it was a little damp
piece of ground. in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before.
(-mloarmiring to come back that way from the eastern part oi-
the island. Hero I found a clear piece of land, near three
acres. so surrounded with woods. that it was almost anl
inehmure by nature; at least. it did not want near so much
lalmur to make it so, as the other piece of ground ] had
worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and,
in loss than a month's time. I had so fenced it round that my _
flock, or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild
now as at first they might be supposed to he, were well enough.
secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten
young she-goats, and two hergoats, to this piece; and, when
lthey were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more
leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal. All
this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehen-
sions on account of the print of a man's foot; for, as yet, I
had never seen any human creature come near the island; and
I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,
indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before,
as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live
in the constant some of the fear of man. And this I must
observe, with grief. too, that the discomposuro of my mind
had great impression also upon the religious part of my
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands
of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker;
at least, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul
which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under
great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger,
and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured
before morning; and I must testify, from my experience,
that a temper of peace, thenkfulness, love and affection, is
much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror
and diseomposure; and that under the dread of mischief
impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance
of the duty of praying to God, than he is for a repentance on
a sick bed; for these discomposnres affect the mind, as the
others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and
much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the
mind, not of the body. ' '

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for
another private place to make such another deposit; when,'
wandering more to the west point of the island than I had
ever done yet, and looking out to see, I thought I saw a boat
upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out
of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so
remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I
looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold in look any
longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do not know, but as I
descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it
over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective
glass in my pocket. \V'hen I was come down the hill to the
end of the island, whom. indeed, I had never been before, I
.was presently convinced that ihe seeing the print of a man's
foot was not such a. strange thing in the island as I imagined,
and but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon
the side of the island where the savages never came, I should
easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for
the canoes from the main. when they happened to be a little too
far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour : likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring
them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful
customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; of
which hereafter.

\Vhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being tho S.\V. point of the island, I was perfectly
confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls,
hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particu-
larly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings
upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of those things, that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had
'heard of it often. yet i never had so near a view of before;
in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle;
my stomach grew sick,and I was just at the point of fainting,
when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and
having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a. moment; so
I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked
on towards my own habitation.

When I came a. little out of that part of the island, I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked
up with the utmost affection of my soul. and. with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first let
in a port of the world where I was distinguished from such
dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for
than to complain of : and this, above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a
felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery
which T had sudered, or could sufier.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went..home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my cir>>
cumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they
could got; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting,
anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the
covered, woody part of it, without finding anything to their
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of human creature there
before; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely con-
cealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them,
which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only
business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was,
unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence
of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of
the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating
one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept
close within my own circle, for almost two years after this:
when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations,
viz. my castle, my country-seat (which I called my bower),
and my inclosure in the woods : nor did I look after this for
any other use than as an inclosure for my goats; for the

.nversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that Iwas as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil
himself. I did not so much as go to look after my beat all
this time, but began rather to think of maldng another; for I
could not think of ever making any more 8.th ts to bring
the other host round the island to me, lest I shou d meet with
some of these creatures at sea; in which case if I had
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would

have been my lot.184- Lll"E AX); .\l'\'l2.\"|'k'ltl-SSS

Timo, however, and the satisfaction I had that l was in no
danger of hoing discovered by those people, began bk wear oli
my uneasiness about them: and I began to live just in tho
sumo composed manner as before. only with this difference,
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about mo
than I did before, lost I should happen to he soon by any of
them ; and particularly. 1 was more cautious of tiring my gun,

it. It was. therefore. :1. very good providence to me that I
had furnished myself with n tome brood of goats, and that I
had no need to hunt any more about the woods. or shoot at
them: and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by
traps and snares, as I had done before ; so that for two cars
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once oll'. though I
never went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved
three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with
me. or at least two of them. sticking them in my goat-skin
bolt. I also fnrhished up one of the great cutlzmsies that I
had out of the ship. and made me a belt to hang it on also; so
that I was now a. mest formidable follow to look at when I
went abroad. if you add to the former description of myself,
the particular of two pistols. and a great broad-sword hanging
at my side in a belt, but without a. scabbm-d.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I
seemed, excepting those cautions, to be reduced to my former
calm, sedate way of living. All those things tended to show
me, more and more. how for my condition 'as from being
miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining
there would be among mankind at any condition of life. if

people would rather compare their condition with those that

' were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which are better, to assist their mm'murings
end compleiniugs.

As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the flights
I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I
had been in for my own preservation, had taken of the edge
of my invention for my own conveniences; and I had dropped
a good design, which I had once bout my thoughts upon. and
that was to tr! if I could not make some of my barley into
malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was
really a whimsical thought, and I roproved myself often for
the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the
want of several things necessary to the making my beer, that
it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed
already, I could never compass: no, though I spent not only
many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no
purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it kee ,
no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boi ;
and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had
not the frights and terrors I was in about the savages inter-
vened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass
too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing
it, when once I had it in my head to begin it. But my inven-
tion new ran quite another way; for, night and day, I could
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment; and, if pos-
sible, save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It
would take up a larger volume than this whole work is
intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched,
or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying
these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent
their coming hither any more: but all this was abortive;
nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it myself: and what could one man do among
them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them
together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with
which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my
1
g"S'ometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds
of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, would
consequently take fire, and blew up all that was near it: but
as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to waste so much
powder u n them, my store being now within the quantity of
one ban-e , so neither could I be sure of its going 05 at any
certain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears
and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the
place: so I laid it aside; and then proposed that I would
place myself in ambush in some convenient plme. with my156 Lll'li .\i\l) ADVENTURES OF llUlHNfiUN ('lll'SUl'L

three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their
bloody ceromony let fly at them, when 1 should he sure to kill
or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and thou falling
in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I mado no
doubt but that. if there were twenty, I should kill them all.
This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so
full of it, that 1 often dreamed of it, and sometinu-s, t'at l
was just going to let lly at them in my sleep. I went_ so fa..-
\\'ith it in my imagination. that l employed myself several.
days to lind out proper places to put myself in ambusende, as
J said, to watch for them, and I wont frequently to the place
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while
my mind was thus tilled with thoughts of revenge and a.
bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword. as I
may call it, the horror 1 had at the place, and at the signals
of the barbarous \\'rvtehes devouring one another, abetted my
malice. Well, at length .1 found a place in tho side of the
hill, where l was satisfied .1 might securely wait till I saw any
of their boats coming; and might then, even before they
would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unm on into
some thiehots of trees, in one of which there was a hollow
large enough to conceal mo entirely; and there I might sit
and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at.
their heads, when they were so close together as that it would
be. next to impossible that 1 should miss my shot, or that I
rould fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. in
this plm-e, then, l resolved to fulfil my design; and llck'Ol'd-
ingly, 1 prepared two nmskets and my ordinary fowling-piceo.
The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four
or live smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and
the fowling--pieco I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of
the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each; and. in this posture, well provided with ammu~
nition for a secom1 and third charge, 1 prepared myself for my
expedition.

After 1 had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if 1
could observe any bpats upon the sea, coming near the island,
or standing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my0817802 PM. "I DmfiVCNON 0? m CAINIBALI.
watch, but came always back without any discovery; there
having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not
only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so for as my
eyes or glass could reach every way. , '
As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits

seemed to be all the while in

a suitable frame for so outrageous

an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for I
an offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion .
of in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the'
people of that country; who, it seems, had been sufiered by
Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no

other guido than that of their own abominable and vitiatcd
passions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been
so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such

dreadful customs, as nothing

but nature, entirely abandoned

by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began
to he weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so
long and so for every morning in vain, so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in ;

whet authority or call I had

to pretend to be judge and execu-

tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought

fit, for so many ages, to snfi

er, unpunished, to go on, and to

be, as it were, the executioners of His judgments one upon
another ; how far these people were offenders against me, and

what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which

they shed promiscuously upo

11 one another. I debated this

very often with myself thus: " How do I know what God
himself judges in this particular case? It is certain then
people do not commit this as a crime ; it is not against their
own consciences rel-proving, or their light reproaching them; '
they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in

defiance of divine justice, as
commit. They think it no

we do in almost all the sins we
more a crime to kill a captive

taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; or to eat human flesh?

than we do to eat mutton."

When I considered this a. little, it followed necessarily that
I was certainly in the wrong; that these people were not
murderers. in the sense that I had before condemned them
in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murder-
ers who of ten put to death the prisoners taken in battle 5 or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw
tlown their arms, and submitted. In the next place, it oe-
eurrod to me, that although the usage they gave one another
Iwas thus bruiish and inhuman. yet it was really nothingr to
me: these people had done me no injury: that if they
attempted. or 1 saw it necessary. for my immediate preserva-
tion, to fall upon them, something might be. said for it: but
that l was yet out of their power, and they really had no
knowledge. of mo. and consequently no design upon me ; and,
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them ; that
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their
barbarities practised in America. where they destroyed mil-
lions of these people ; who, however they were idolalers and
luirbariauis, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols,
were yet. as to the Spaniards, very innocent people : and that
the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the
utmost abhorrenee and detestation by even the Slrmiards
themselves. at. this time. and by all other Christian nations of
Europe, as a more lunehery. a bloody and unnatural piece of
eruelty. unjustifiable either to God or man ; and for which the
very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and
terrible to all people of humanity or of Christian eempission ;
as if the kingdom of Spain were particnlmly eminent for tho
prodnee of a ram of men, who were without principles of
tenderness. or (he eommon bowels of pity to the miseiable,
which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the
mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause. and to akiud
of a full stop; and l began. by little and little. to he oil: my
design. and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my
resolution to attael: the savages: and that it was not my
business to meddle with them. unless they first attacked me ;
and this it was my business. if possible. to prevent : but. that. if
.1 were discovered and attarlced by them. I knew my duty. (in
the other hand. I argued with myself . that this really "as the
way not to deliver myself. but entirely to ruin and destroy
myself: for. unless. I was sure to kill every one that not only
should be on shore at>> that time, but that should CVH' come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their
country-people what had happened, they would come over again
by thousan s to revenge the death of their fellows, and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which,
at present, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole,
I concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy,
one way or other, to concern myself in this affair: that my:.
business was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by
that there were any living creatures upon the island--I mean
of human shape. Religion joined in with this prudential
resolution ; and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was
perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures--I mean
innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they
were national, and I ought to leave 11mm to the just'ce of
God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by
national punishments, to make a just retribution for national
oll'enccs, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend
in a public manner, by such ways as best please Him. This
appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satis-
faction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing
which I now saw so much reason to believe would have been
no less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed
it; and I gave most humble thanks, on my knees, to God,
that He had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness ; beseech-
ing Him to grant me the protection of His providence, that I
might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I
might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear
call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this:
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the
hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my mntrivnnces against
them, or be provoked by any advantage that might present
itself, to fall upon them : only this I did ; I went and removed
my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole iSIand, where 1
ran it into a little cove. which I found under some high rocks,
and where I knew, by reason of tho currents, the savages
durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon any

1111s1~1111 dangers. :11111 111111 1:1th me from those mischiefs which
1 1-1111111 have 1111 way been the agent in delivering myself
from, because I had not the least notion of any such thing
depending, or the least supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had come into my
thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the
merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through
in this life ; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know
nothing of it ; how, when we are in a quandary (as we ml] it),
a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way, a
secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that
way : nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps"
business, has called us to go the other way, yet a strange
impression upon the mind, from we know ,not what springs,
and by we know not what power, shall overrule us to go
this way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone
that way which we should have gone, and even to our imagi-
nation ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and
lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I afterwards
made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found these
secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing any-
thing that presented, or going this way or that way, I never
failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other
reason for it than such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of this
conduct in the course of my life, but more especially in the
latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides
many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice
of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I see with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all
considering men, whose lives are attended with such extra-
ordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extra-
ordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence,
let them come from what invisible intelligence they will.
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but
certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and a secret
communication between those embodied and those unembodied,'
and such a. proof as can never be withstood ; of which I shall
have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the
remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in,
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all
invention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my

and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand : I
had not gone three steps in, before I was almost as much
frightened as before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that
of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise,

.08 of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I
stepped back, and was indeed Strllck with such a surprise that
it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my
head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have
lifted it OK. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I
could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that
the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able
to protect me, I stepped forward again. and by the light of
N 2
the firebrand. holding it up a. little over my head, I saw lying
on the ground a. monstrous, frightful, old ho-gout, just making
his will, in we say, and gasping for life, und dying, indeed. of
more old nge. l stirred him a little to see if I could gel him
out, and he. ossnyod to get up, but wus not able to raise
himself: and I thought with myself he might even lie
tlierm--fur if he had frightened me, so he would coitainly
fright any of the savages. if any of them oliould he so hardy
as to come in there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and hogan to look
round me, when I found the care was but very small, that is
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner
of shape, neither round nor square, no hands lnwing ever
been employed in making it but those of mem Nature. 1
observed also that there was a. place at the farther side of it
that went in further, but was so 124'" that it required mo in
creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it
went I knew not; so, hoving no candle, I gnvo it over for
that time, but resolved to go again the next day provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock
of one of (he muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
mndles of my own making (for I made very good candles
now of goat's tallow, but was hard set for candlewiek, using
sometimes rags or rope--yarn. and sometimes tho drii d rind of
a weed like nettles); and going into this low phue I was
obliged to creep upon nil-fours, as I have said, almost ten
yards --which, by the way, I thought was A venture bold
enough, considering that 1 know not how for it might go, nor
what was beyond it. When I lmd got through the strait, I
,found the roof rose higher up. I believe near twenty foot;
\but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare
'say, as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault
or cove--the wall reflected a hundred thousand light-s to me
from my two candles. What it was in the rock--whether
diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold--which I
rather supposed it to be--I knew not. The place I was in
was a. most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly
(lurk ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small
loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or
venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp
or wet on the sides or roof. The only diflicultv in it was the
entrance--which, however, as it was a place of security, and
such a retreat as I wanted, I thought was a convenience; so
that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved,
without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was
most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved to
bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms,
viz. two fowling-pieces--for I had three in all--and three
muskots--for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my
castle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of
cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take out
lnpon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my '
ammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which
1 took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I
found that the water had penetrated about three or four
inches into the powder on every side, which caking and
growing hard, had prrserved the inside like a kernel in the
shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder
in the centre of the cask. This was .n very agreeable dis-
covery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me
in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried
thither all the lead I had left for bullets. 1
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was
here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they
could never find me out--or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found
expiring died in the mouth of the care the next day after I
made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a
great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earthfi
than to drag him out ; so I interred him there, to prevent .
offence to my nose. .~'
I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this
island, and was so naturalized to the place and the manner of
living, that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
bren content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down

winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, wh en,
going out early in the morning, even before it was thorough
daylight, I was surprised with seeing a. light of some fire upon
the shore, at a. distance from me of about two miles, toward
that part of the island where I had observed some savage>>;
had been, as before, and not on the other side,--but, to my
great aflliction, it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be

 

' CIIUSUP. sun: A LIGHT ON THE anon: IN THIS EARLY MORNING.

surprised; and yet I had no more peaee within, from the
apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over
the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of
my works or improvements, they would immediately conclud;
that there were people in the place, and would then never
rest till they had found me out. In this extremity I went'
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me,
and made all things without look as wild and natural as
I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture
of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them--that
is to say, my muskots, which were mounted upon my new
fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp--not forgetting seriously to commend myself
lo the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. 1 continued
in this posture about two hours, and began to be impatient
.'or intelligence abroad, for 1 had no spies to send out. After
sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this
case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer; 80'
setting up my ladder lo the side of the hill, where there. was
a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder
after me. I act it up again and mounted the top of the hill,
and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on
purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and
began to look for the place. I presently found there were no
less than nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they
had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they
had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not
tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so
near to me; but when I considered their coming must be,
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be
more sedate in my mind, being: satisfied that I might go abroad
with safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on
shore before ; and having made. this observation, T went abroad
about my harvest work with the more mmposuro.

As 1 expected, so it proved : for, as soon as the tide made
to the westward, i saw them all take boat and row (or paddle
as we call it) away. I should have observed, that for an
hour or more before they went off they were dancing, and I
could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass.
I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they
were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them ;
but whether they were men or women I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I tool: two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my
great sword by my side without a scabbard, and with all the
speed I was able to make went away to the hill where I
had discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon as I
got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could
not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I per--
ceivod there had been three canoes more of the savages at
that place; and looking out further, I saw they were all at
sen. together, making over for the main. This was a dreadful
sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore, I could
see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been
about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and
of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those
wrotehes with merriment and sport. I was so filled with.
indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom
or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits
which they made thus to this island were not very frequent,
for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came
on shore there again,--that is to say, I neither saw them nor
any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to
the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at
least not so far. Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon
me by surprise : from whence I observe, that the expectation
of mil is more bitter than the suffering, cepecially if there is
no room to shake off that expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and
spent most of my hours, which should have been better em-
ployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them
the very next time I should see them--especially if they
should be divided, as they were the last time, into two
parties ; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party
--snppose ten or n. dozen--I was still the next day, or week,
or month. to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitmn,
till I should be, at length, no less a murderer than they were
in being man-caters--and perhaps much more so. I spent
my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, ex-
pecting that I should one day or other fall into the hands
of these merciless creatures; and if_ I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking around me with the
greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to
my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a204 1.] rr. Ann Am'sx'runns

tame fleck or herd of goats, for 1 durst not upon any account
the my gun, especially near that side of the island where they
usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they
had lied from me new, 1 was sure to have them come again
with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few
days, and then i knew what to expect. However, I were out
a year and three months more before I ever saw any more
of the. savages, and than I found them again, as 1 shall soon
observe. It is true they might have been there once or twice 5
hut either they made no stay, or at least I did not see them ;
but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in
my fourand-twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter
with them; of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months' interval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed
always frightful drcmns, and often started out of my sleep in
the night. In the day, great troubles overwhelmed my mind;
and in the night, 1 dreamed often of killing the savages, end
of the reasons why I might justify doing it.

But to were all this for a. while.- It was in the middle of
May, on the sixteenth day, 1 think, as well as my poor
wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the
post still ; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew
a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it.
I knew not what was the particular occasion of it ; but as I
was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious
thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised with
the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. This was. to he
sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any 1 had
met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts
were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
inmginnble; and, in a. nice, clapped my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the
second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a
flash of fire bid mo listen for a second gun, which, accordingly,
in about half a minute. I heard ; and by the sound, knew that
it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down the
current in my boat. I immediately considered that this must
be some ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
seine other ship in company, and tired these for signals of
distress, and to obtain help. 1 had the. presence of mind, at
that minute, to think, that though I could not help them, it
might be they might help me; so I brought together all the
dry wood I_could get at hand, and, making a good handsome
pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and
blazed freely; and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there was any
such thing as a ship, they must need see it. And no doubt
they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard
mother gun, and after that several others, all from the same
quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and
when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw some-
thing at a great distance at sea, full east of the island,
whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish--no, not with
my glass; the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also ; at least, it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived
that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a
ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the
south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly
been carried away by the current; and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the
night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was
out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence
of the strewn, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy,
were the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate,
hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ;
for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their
knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been
driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at
E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endea-
voured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their
boat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.
First, I imagined that upon seeing my light, they might have
put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured to make the
shore; but that the sea running very high, they might have
been cast away. Other times, I imagined that they might have
lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways;
particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which
many times obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their
boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own
hands. Other times, I imagined they had some other ship or

 

CRUSOE GETS A VIEW OF THE WBBCK.

ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they made,
had taken them up, and carried them off. Other times, I
fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being
hurried awaa,v by the current that I had been formerly in;
were carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing
but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by
this time think of starving, and of being in o. condition to eat
one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condi-
tion I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery
of the poor men, and pity them; which had still this good
effect upon my side, that it gave me more and more cause to
give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro.
vided for me in my desolate condition ; and that of two shi 8'
companies, who were new cast away upon this part of t 9
world, not. one life should be spared but mine. I learned here
again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of
God costs us into any condition so low, or any misery so great,
but we may see something or other to be thankful for, and
may see others in worse circumstances than our own. Such
certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so
much as see room to suppose any were saved ; nothing could
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did
not all perish there, except the possibility only of their being
taken up by another ship in company; and this was but more
possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance
of any such thing. I cannot explain, by any possible energy
of words, what a. strange longing I felt in my soul upon this
sight, breaking out sometimes thus :--" 0 that there had been
but one or two, my, or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to
have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion,
one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have con-
vcrsed with l " In all the time of my solitary life, I never
felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my
fellow-creatures, or so deep a. regret at the want oSS it.

There are some secret springs in the afiections, which, when
they me set a-going by some object in view, or, though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of
imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetu-
osity, to such violent, eager embmcings of the object, that
the absence of it is insupportable. Such were these earnest
wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I re-
peated the words, " O that it had been but one! " a thousand
times 3 and my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke
the words my hands would clinch together, and my fingers
would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had had any
soft thing in my hand, I should have crushed it involuntarily;
and the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against
one another so strong, that for some time 1 could not pint
them again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them. All 1 can do is, to describe the
fact, which was even surprising to me when I found it, though
I knew not from whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the
ell'ect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my
mind, lealizing the comfo1t which the convelsution of one of

yfollow Chiistians 11 ould have been to me. But it was not
to ybe; either thei1 fate 01 mine, or both, fo1h11do it; for till
the last yea1 oi 1113-b11ing on this island, I novel knew w hothei
any were saved out of 0that ship or no ; and had only the
ailliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned hey
come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes 011 but a seanmn' s waistcoat, a
pair of open- -kneed linen d1awe1s, and a blue linen shi1t; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was
of. lie had nothing in his pockets but two pieces of eight and
:1 tobacco-pipe--the last was to me of ten times more value
than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me. But that did not
altogether press me so much as the possibility that thc1e
might be 3 et some living creature on board, whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, ooxnfoit my own
to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my healt
that I could not be quiet night or day, but 1 must venture out
in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to
God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon
my mind that it could not be resisted--that it must come from
some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to
myself if I did not go. .

Under the power of this impression, I hastened hack to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a
bottle of rum (for I had still 11 great deal of that left), and a
basket of 1aisins;and thus, loading myself with everything
necessarv, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her,
get her :itioat, loaded all my cargo in gher, and then went home
at-ain for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice,
the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large
pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small leaves, or
barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's-milk,
and a cheese : all which with great labour and sweat I carried
to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put
out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came
at last to the utmoet point of the island on the north-east
side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance.
and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of
the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail
me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those
currents, I should he carried a great way out to sea, and per-
haps out of my reach, or sight of the island again; and that
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind
should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise ; and having hauled my boat into a. little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon a rising
bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and
desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could per-
ceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on ; upon
which, my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon
this, presently it occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could,
how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out,
I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the
some rapidity of the currents. This thought was no sooner in
my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill, which sulfi-
cicntly overlooked the sen both ways, and from whence I had
a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way
1 mm to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as
the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore
of the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep
to the north side of the island in my return, and I should do
well enough. -

Encouraged by this observation, I resolved, the next morn-
ing, to set out with the first of the tide; and, reposing myself
for the night in my canoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned.

0210 urn AND [summons

'I launched out. I first mode a. little out to see, full north,
till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set east-
ward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did not
so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before,
so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having
a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a great rate,
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I come up
to it. It was a dismal sight to look at : the ship, which, by
its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two
rocks. All the stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces
by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremost
were brought by the board~that is to say, broken short oil;
but her bowsprit was sound, and the hood and bow appeared
firm. \thn I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her.
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ,' and, as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me. I took him
into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and
thirst. I gave him a. cake of my bread, and he devoured it
like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a. fortnight in the
snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with
which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forcenstle of the
ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded,
as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a.
storm, the sea. broke so high, and so continually over her, that
the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the
ship that had life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor,'
whether wine or bramly I knew not, which lay lower in
;tho hold, and which. the water being ebbed out, 1 could see;
but they were too big to meddle with. I saw sew-ml chests,
which, 1 believe, belonged to some of the seamen; and I got
two of them into the boat, without examining what was in
them. llad the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart
broken off, I am lwrsunded .I might have made a. good voyage ;
for, by what I found in these two chests. I had room to sup-
pose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I
may guess from the course she steered. she must have been
'oound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio do 19. Plate, in the south.
part of America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the
Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any-
body; but what became of the crew I then know not.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much
dilliculty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a
great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it:
as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them,
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongx,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a.
copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this
cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make
home again: and the same evening, about an hour within
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the
last degree. I reposed that night in the boat; and in the
morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave,
and not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself,
I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the par-
ticulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a. kind of rum, but
not such as we had at the Brazils ; and, in a. word, not at all
good; but when I came to open the chests, I found several
things of great use to me : for example, I found in one a fine
case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about
three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two
pots of very good succadcs, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on
the top that the self-water had not hurt them ; and two more
of the same, which the water had Spoiled. I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a
'dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured

neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being exceed--
ingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this,
' when I came to the till in the chest, I found there three great
bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred
pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six
. doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I
suppose they might all weigh near a. pound. In the other
'chest were some clothes, but of little value ; but, by the cir-
cumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate;
though there was no powder in it, except two pounds) of fine
\ o .
glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging
their funding-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very
little by this voyage that was of any use to me ; for, as to the
money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to mo as
the dirt under my feet, and I would have given it all for three
or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things
"I greatly wanted, but had had none on my feet for many
years. I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I took
09" the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck,
and I found two {air more in one of tho chests, which were
very welcome to me ; but they were not like our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in this sennxun's chest about fifty
pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I suppose this belonged
to a. poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some oilicer. "'ell, howevu -, I luggcd this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I bald
brought from our own ship ; but it was a. great pity, as I said,
that the other part of this ship had not come to my share; low
I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over
with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it
might lie here safe enough till I come again and fetch it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and seemed

them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made
the host of my way to my old habitation, where I found
everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family afinirs ; and
for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad
so much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it
was always to tho east part of the island, where I was pretty,
well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go
'without so many precautions, and such a. load of arms and,
ammunition as 1 always carried with me if 1 went the other
way. I lived in this condition near two years more ; but my
unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to
make my body miserable, was all these two years filled with pro-
jects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island: for, sometimes I was for making another voyage
to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was
nothing left there worth the h. zard of my voyage ; sometimes
for a ramble one way, sometimes another: and I believe
verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I
should have ventured to sea, hound anywhere, I knew not
whither. I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to
those who are touched with the general plague of mankind,
whence, for alight I know, one half of their miseries flow; I
mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God
and Nature hath placed them : for, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition to which was, as I may call it, my m'igilml sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of
my coming into this miserable condition; for had that Provi-
dence which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a planter
blessed me with confined desires, and I could have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been by
this time--I mean in the time of my being in this island--
one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils: nay,
I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had made in
that little time I lived there, and the increase I should
probably have made if I had remained, I might have been
worth a hundred thousand moidores: and what business had I
to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased our stock at
home, that we could have bought them at our own door from
those whose business it was to fetch them? and though it had
cost us something more, yet the difference of that price was
by no means worth saving at so great a hazard. But as this
is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly
of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of tho'
dear-bought experience of time: so it was with me now; and
yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I
could not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually
poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this
place: and that I may, with greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not he
improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the
subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and
upon what foundation I acted.
I am now to be supposed retired in my castle, after my late

voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under
water, as usual, and my candition restored to what it was

l
before: I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but
was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than
the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and twentieth year of my lirst setting foot in this island
of solitude, l was lying in my bed or hmnmoek, awake, very
well in health. had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of
body, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinar , but
could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no,
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows :--It is
impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts
that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain,
the memory, in this night's time : I ran over the whole history
of my life in miniature, or by abridgmont, as I may call it, to
my coming to this island, and also of that part of my life
since I came to this island. In my reflections upon the state
of my case since. I came on shore on this island, I was com-
paring the happy posture of my allairs in the first years of my
habitation heir, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which
I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of 9. foot in the
sand. Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented
the island even all the while, and might have been several
hundreds of them at times on show there; but I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it 5
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same,
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had
never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly this
one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which has
provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds
to his sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks
in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which,
if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his
spirits. ho is kept. serene and calm, by having the events of
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in
for so many years in this very island, and how I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity,
even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, 9. great
tree. or the casual approach of night, had been between me3- /
or nosmsou causes. 915

and the worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me
with the same view as I would on a goat or turtle; and have
thought it no more crime to kill and devour me, than I did of
a pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I
should say 1 was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserves,
to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with great
humility, all these unknown deliversnces were due, and
'without which I must inevitably have fallen into their
merciless hands. I

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures,
I mean the savages, and how it came to pass in the world,
that the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his '
creatures to such inhumanity--nay, to something so much
below even brutality itself--as to devour its own kind: but as
this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it
occurred to me to inquire, what part of the world these
wretches lived in? how far OR the coast was from whence
they came? what they ventured over so far from home for!
what kind of boats they had'l and why I might not order
myself and my business so, that I might be able to go over
thither, as they were to come to me?

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I went thither; what would
become of me if I fell into the hands of these savages; or
how I should escape them if they attacked me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attacked by some or other of them, without any
possibility of delivering myself 2 and if I should not fall into
their hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I.
should bend my course: none of these thoughts, I say, so
much as came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent
upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main-l.
land. I looked upon my present condition as the most
miserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to
throw myself into anything but death, that could he called
'worse; and if I reached the shore of the main, I might
perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on
the African shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and

. where I might find some relief; and, after all, perhaps I
might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in z216 mm: mm Anvssrunns

and if the worst came to the worst, I could but dio, which
would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all
this was tho fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient; temper,
made desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of my
troubles. and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I
had been on board of, and where I had been so near obtaining
what, I so earnestly longed for- -somehody to speak to, and to
learn some knowledge from them of the place where. I was,
and of the probable means of my deliverance. I was agitated
awholly by t-lnse thoughts: all my calm of mind, in my
res-motion to l'rm'idenee, and waiting tho issue of the dispo-
sit-ions of .lleaven, souned in he. sits) ended; and 1 had, as it
\"t ro. no power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the
project, of a. voyage to tho main. which came upon me with
sash force. and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not
to be l't'Slrtt'tl.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours ormoro,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a. ferment,
and my pulse beat as if 1 had been in a. fever, merely with
the oxtraordinxu-y fervour ol' my mind about it, Nature--as if
1 had been fatigued and exhaust"! with the very thoughts of
it--throw me into a sound sloop. One would have thought
I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything
relating to it : but I dreamed that. as I was going out in the
morning as usual. from my east-lo, 1 saw upon the shore two
canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that they
brought with them another savage, whom they were going to
kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, tho savage that
they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and
I thought, in my sleep, that be came running into my little
thick grove before my fortification, to hide himself; and that
I, seeing him alono, and not perceiving that the others sought
him that way, sliowed myself to him, and smiling upon him,
encouraged him: that he kneoled down to me, seeming to
pray mo to assist him ; upon which I showed him my ladder,
made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he
became my servant : and that as soon as I had got, this man,
I said to myself, "Now I may certainly venture to the main-
land, for this follow will serve. me as a pilot and will tell me
what to do, and whit-her to go for provisions, and whither not
to go for fear of being devoured ; what places to venture into,
and What: to shun." I wuked with this thought; and was

. i - -u.......t
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of
my escape in my dream. that the disappointments which I
felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only
way to go about to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get
a savage into my possession ; and, if possible, it should be one
of their prisoners, whom. they had condemned to be eaten, and
sh-mld bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty: that it was impossible to effect
this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing
them all; and this was not onlya very desperate attempt, and
might miscarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
sampled the lawfulness of it to myself ; and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though
it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments
which occurred to me against this, they being the same men-
tioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer new,
viz. that those men were enemies to my life, and would devour
me if they could ; that it was self-preservation, in the highest
degree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually
assaulting me, and the like; I say, though these things argued
for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my
deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by
no means reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at
last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great
perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and
another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager 'pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at length mustered all the rest;
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my
hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive
how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on ;
but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I
resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they
came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking
'such measures as the opportunity should present, let what
would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon
the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was
heartily tired of it; or it was above a year and a. half that I218 mn'un amen-rungs;

waited; and for giem 'zru orthat time went out to the
west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost
every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was
very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I
cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done some time
before) wear oil the edge of my desire to the thing ; but the
longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it:
in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of
these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now
eager to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself able to
manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as
to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do
me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself
with this afiair; but nothing still presented itself; all my
fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near
me for a great while.

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execution),
I was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the
people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight.
The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or
sometimes more in a boat, 1 could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty
men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and
disconiforted. However, I put myself into the same position
for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just
ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at
length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my
ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two
stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head did not
appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by
any means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that
they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed.
How they had cooked it, I knew not, or what it was; but
they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous
gestures andfigures, their own way, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my per-
spective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats,
where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out
for the slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall ;
being knocked down,:_I suppose, with a. club, or wooden sword,
for that was their way; and two or three others were at work
immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the

,other victim was left standing by himself, till they should be
'reudy for him. In that very moment, this poor wretch,
seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound, Nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands,
directly towards me; I mean, towards that part of the coast
where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I
must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way ; and
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the
whole body 3 and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in
my grove: but I could not depend, by any means, upon my
dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither,
and find him there. However, I kept my station, and my
spirits began to recover when I found that there was not
above three men that followed him; and still more was I
encouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceed-
ingly in running, and gained ground on them; so that, if he
could but hold out for half an hour, I saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I
mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed
my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must
necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken
there; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made
nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in,
swam). through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed,
and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the
three persons came to the creek, I found that two of them
could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, and
soon after went softly back again; which, as it happened, was
very well for him in the and. I observed that the two who
swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now
was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or
assistant ; and that I was plainly called by Providence to save
this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the ladders
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they
were both at the foot of the ladders, as 1 observed before, and
getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I
crossed towards the sea ; and having a very short out, and all
down hill. plavvd myself in the way between the pursuors and
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that lied, who, looking back,
was at first perhaps as much frightened at mo as at them ; but
I hoekoued with my hand to him to come back ; and, in the
meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed;
then rushing at 01100 upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the steel; of my piece. I was loath to lire, because I
would not have the rest hear ; though, at that distance, it
would not have been easin heard, and being out of sight of
the smoke, too, they would not have known what to make of
it. Having knocked this follow down, the other who pursued
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced
towards him : but as I mime nearer, I perceived presently he
had a how and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me: so 1 wits
then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him
at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but lad stopped,
though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he
thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my
piece, that he stood stock still, and neither came forward, nor
went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly
than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to
come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little
way ; then stopped again, and then a. little farther, and
stopped again ; and 1 could then perceive that he stood.
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been~
to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned tohim
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encourage-
ment that 1 could think of ; and he came nearer and newer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknow-
ledgment for saving his life, I smiled at him, and looked
pleamntly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length,
he came close to me ; . and than he kneeled down again. kissed
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and, taking me
by the foot, set my foot upon his head ; this, it seems, was in
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up and made much of him. and encouraged him all I could.
not there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the
savage whom 1 had knocked down was not killed, but stunned
with the blow, and began to come to himself : so I pointed to
him. and showed him the savage. that he was not dead 5 upon
thi" he <1) ihe some Words to mo, and though I could not under-
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hour; for
they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard,
my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was
no time for such reflections now ; the savage who was knocked
down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground,
and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid ; but when
I saw that, I' presented my other piece at the man, as if I
would shoot him : upon this, my savage, for so I call him now,
made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner had
it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow, out off his bed
so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better ; which I thought very strange for one who,
I had reason to believe, never saw a. sword in his life before,
except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I
learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp,
so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even out
ol'i heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too.
\Vlien he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with abundance
of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, with
tho he rd of the savage that he had killed, just before me.
llut that which astonished him most, was to know how I
killed the other Indian so for 011'; so, pointing to him, he
uuule signs to me to let him go to him ; and I bade him go, as
well as I could. 'Vhen he came to him, he stood like one
unmzod, looking at him, turning him first on one side. then on
the other ; looked at the wound the bullet had made, which
it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and
no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled
inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and
arrows, and czuuo hack ; so I turned to go away, and beckoned
him to follow me, making signs to him that more might come
after them. Upon this he made signs to me that he'should

bury them with sand, that they might not be soon by the rest,222 mm AND Imvemrans

if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so.
He fell to work; and in an instant he had scraped a. hole in
the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and
then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by the
other also ; I believe he had buried them both in a quarter of
an hour. Then, alling him away, I carried him, not to my
'astle. but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of tho
island: so I did not let my dream come to pass in that part,
that. he came. into my grove for shelter. Hero I gave him
bread and a. bunch of raisins to eat, and a drought of water,
which I found he was indeed in great distress for, from his
running: and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go
and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where 1 had laid
some rice-straw, and a. blanket upon it, which 1 used to sleep
upon myself sometimes 3 so the poor creature lay down, and
went tvd'sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight strong limbs, not. too large, tall and well
shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of ago.
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly
aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his face;
and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a. European
in his countenance too, especially when he. smiled. llis hair
was long and black. not curled like wool: his forehead very
high and large ; and a gr 'at vivaeity and sparkling sharpness
in his eyes. The. colour of his skin was not quite black, but
very tawny; and yet not. an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America
are. but of a. bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it
something very agreeable. though not very easy to describe.
His face was round and plump; his nose small, not flat like
the Negroes; a very good mouth. thin lips, and his fine teeth
well set, and as white as ivory.

After he had slumlnred, rather than slept, about half an
hour, he awoke again. and came out of the cave to mo: for I
had been milking my goats. which I had in the inclosuro just.
by: when he espied me. he 'amo runningr to me. laying
himself down again upon the. ground. with all the lmssiblo
signs of an humble. thankful disposition, making a great
many antic gostures to show it. At last. he lays his head
"at upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as ho had done before ; and after this, made
all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long as
he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; and,
first, I let him know his name should be FRIDAY, which was
the day I saved his life: I called him so for the memory of
the time. I likewise taught him to say Master; and then let
him know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him to
say Yes and N o, and to know the meaning of them. I gave
him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it
before him, and sop my bread in it; and gave him a cake of
bread to do the like, which he uiekly complied with, and
made signs that it was very good or him. I kept there with
him all that night; but, as soon as it was day, I beckoned to
him to come with me, and let him know I would give him
some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the
two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the
marks that he had made to find them again, making signs to
me that we should dig them up again and eat them. At this,
I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made
as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with
my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top of the
hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them or their canoes ; so that it
was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades
behind them, without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my
man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with
the how and arrows at his back, which I found he could use
very dextemusly, making him carry one gun for me, and I
two for myself; and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within
me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing
of it. The place was covered with human bones 'the ground22f mm mm Anvm'rrnm or mums-on cmzmr.

might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my
two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside
of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my
cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of
boards, and set it up in the passage, as little within the
entrance; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too 3 so that
Friday could no way some at me in the inside of my inner-
most wall, without making so much noise in getting over that
it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had now a com-
plete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and
leaning up to the side of the hill; which was again laid
across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched
over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong,
like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in
or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of trap-door, which,
if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have
opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great
noise: as to weapons, I took them all into my side every
night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday
was to me ; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly
obliged and engaged; his very aiiections were tied to me, like
those of a child to a father; and I dare say he would have
sacrificed his life to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever:
the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt,
and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions
for my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God in His providence,
and in the government of the works of His hands, to take
from so great a part of the world of His creatures the best
uses to which their faculties and the were of their souls
are adapted, yet that He has bestowe upon them the same
powers, the same reason, the same afiections; the same senti-
ments of kindness and obligation; the same passions, and
resentments of wrongs, the some sense of gratitude, sincerity,
fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good, and receiving
good, that He has given to us; and that when He pleases to
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay,
more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which they

thought; that. in ordur to bring Friday off from his horrid way

ought, to lot. him taste other Ilosb ; so I took lum out With mo
ono morning to tho woods. I wont. indeed, intending to kill
a kid out. of my own flock, and luring it homo and dress it;0P nomNsoN ('Iutson. 229

but as I was going, I saw a she goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. 1 eatehed hold of Friday;

" Hold," said I, " stand still ; " and made signs to him not
to stir: immediately, I presented my piece, shot, and killed
one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance,
'indved, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know,
nor could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised;
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I thought he
would have sunk down. lie did not see the kid I shot at, or
IX'l'Cl'lVO I. had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel
whether he was not wounded ; and. as 1' found presentlyn
thought I was resolved to kill him: for he came and kneeled
down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the
meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

] soon found a way to convince him that ] would do him no
harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again. liy~aud>>by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting
upon a tree within shot ; so, to lot li'riday understand a little
what [would do, I called him to me again, pointed at tho
fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been
a hawk ; 1 say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to I
the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make it
fall, 1 made him under-stimd that I would shoot and kill that
bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately
he saw the parrot fall. llo stood like one frightened again,
notwithsumding all I had said to him; and I found he we:1

bird. or anything near or far off; and the astonishment this
created in him was such as could not wear oil for a long time ;
and, I believe, if I would have let him, he would have wor-
shipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not
so much as touch it for several days after; but he would
speak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he
was by himself ; which, as I afterwards learned of him, waste
desire it not to kill him. Well, after his astonishment was a
little over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird1230 Li H: .-\.\'n Al;\'F.N'|'l'lU-'.S

I had shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for the
parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a good dis-
tance from the place where she fell: however, he found her,
took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived

is ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to
charge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I
might be read y for any other mark that might present ; but
nothing more oil'ered at that time: so I brought homo the
kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out
as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that purpose, I
boiled or stewed seine of the flesh, and made some very good
broth. After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but
that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with
it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat ;
and putting a little into his own month, he seemed to nauscato
it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with
fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat into
my month without salt, and .[ pretended to spit and sputter
for want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it
would not do; he would never care for salt with meat or
in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and then but a
very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the
kid: this I did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I
had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, one
on each side of the lire, and one acress the top, and tying the
string to the cross stick, letting' the meat turn continual] y. This
Friday admired very much 3 but when he came to taste the
llesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him: an! at last he told me,
.as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any more,
~which I was very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to work beating some corn out, one.
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I. especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of ; for after that, I let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time, Friday was able
to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feedi

or nosmson chosen. 231 '

instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the
same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very
willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I told
him what it was for ; that it was for corn to make more bread:
because he was now.with me, and that I might have enough
for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that
part, and let me know that he thought I had much more
labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; and
that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of .
every place I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to
me; so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my
tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for
before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, un-
feigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and
I began really to love the creature; and on his side, I believe
he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to
love anything before. I

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his
own country again; and having taught him English so well
that he could answer me almost any question, I asked him.
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle? At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always
fight the better ; " that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight; and so we began the following discourse :-- .

Madam--You always fight the better; how come you to be
.aken prisoner then, Friday?

Friday--My nation beat much for all that.

' Medea--How beat? If your nation beat them, how cam.
you to be taken?

Friday--They more many than my nation, in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me : my nation
over-beat them in the yonder place, where me no was 3 there
my nation take one, two, great thousand. ,

Master.---But why did not your side recover you from the

. hands of your enemies than?
Friday--They run, one, two, three, and mo, and make go
in the canoe : my nation have no canoe that time.

Airmen--\Vell, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they wry them away and eat them,
as these did!

Friday--Yes, my nation eat mans too: eat all up.

Matrix--"mere do they carry them?

Friday--Go to other place, where they think.

Muslim--Do they come hither?

1"1'2'<((1._1/.----Yes, yes, they come. hither; come other else place.

Marten--Have you been here with them?

1"r/<<Iu//.----Yrs, l have been here (points to the N.W. side of
the island. which, it seems, was their side).

By this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
further part of the island, on the some men eating occasions
he was now brought for: and, some time after, when I took
the courage to carry him to that side, being the some I
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me
he was thrre once, when they ate up twenty men, two women,
and one child : he could not tell twenty in English, but he
nlunbvred them, by laying so many stones in 3 row, and
pointing to me to tell them over.

I have. told this pussngo, because itintroduces what follows:
that after this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far
it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canon;
were not often lost. He told me there was no danger, no
canoes ('Vrr lost ; but that after a little way out to see, there
was :1. cul'rrnt and wind, always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon. This I understood to he no more than
the. sets of the tide, as going out or coming in ; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulph
of which river, :1>>; I found afterwards, our island lay; and that
this hind which I perceived to be \V. and N .\V. was the great
island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river.
I asked Friday a. thousand questions about the country, the
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near:
he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable.
I asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than Caribs: from whence
I easily understood that these were the Ceribbees, which our
maps place on the part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St.
Martha. He told me, that up a great way beyond the moon,
that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be
west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men,
like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I men-
tioned before; and that they had killed much mans, that
was his word : by all which I understood he meant the-
Spaniards, whose cruclties in America had been spread over
the whole country, and were remembered by all the nations
from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island, and get among these white men: he told me, "Yes,
yes, you may go in two canoe." I could not understand what
he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two
canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it
must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of
Friday's discourse I began to relish very well; and from this
time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, Imight
find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind; particularly I asked him one time, who made him.
The poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought
I had asked who was his father: but I took it up by another
handle, and asked him, who made the see, the ground we
walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, " It was
one Benamuckee. that lived beyond 811;" he could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, " much
older," he said, "than the see. or land. than the moon or the
stars." I asked him then, if this old person had made all
sthings, why did not all things worship him'l He looked
very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, " All
things say 0 to him." I asked him, if the people who die in his
country went away anywhere? He said, " Yes; they all went
to Benamuckee." Then I asked him whether those they eat
up went thither tool He said, " Yes." .

From these things, I began to instruct him in the know-
ledge of the true God : I told him that the great Maker of all
'things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven; that He

. _;.a|:234 tun-z AND .nmcm'mms

governed the world by the same power and providence by
which He made it; that lie was omnilmtent. and could do
everything for us, give everything to ns----tako overythin
from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. llo listeno
with great attention. and received with pleasure the notion of
J mum ('hrist being sent to redeem us; and of the manner of
making our prayers to (led, and Ilia being able to hear us,
even in heaven. He told me one day, that if our (led could
hear us. up beyond the sun. he must needs be a greater (led
.5 than their Ilenamnckee, who lived but a little way oil', and yet'.
could not hear till they Went up to the great mountains where
he dwelt to speak to him. il asked him if over he went thither
to speak to him 2 He said, " No ; they never went that were
young men; none went thither but the old men," whom he
called their Uowokakeo; that is, as I made him explain to
me. their religious, or clergy; and that they wont to say 0
(so he called saying prayers), aml then came back and told
them what lienmnuekeo said. By this I observed, that there
is priesteraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans
in the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion,
in order to preserve the roneration of the people to the
clergy, not only to he found in the Roman, but, perhaps,
among all religions in the World, even among tho most brutish
and barbarous savages.
l endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
and told him that the prei'mme of their old men going up to
the mountains to say () to their god llenamuckee was a cheat;
and their bringing: word from thence what he said was much
more so ; that if they met with any answer. or spake with any
one there. it must he with an evil spirit : and then I entered into
a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of him, his
rebellion against (ind, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his
setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be wor-
shipped inxtwid of (led, and as (led, and the many stratagems
no made use of to delude mankind to their ruin ; how he had
iseeret access to our passions and to our ailections, and to
\dapt his snares to our inclinations. so as to cause us even to
be our own tompters, and run upon our destruction by our
Own choice.
1 found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil as it was about the being of a God:
miture assisted all my arguments to :ridence to him even theor 1:01:11:sz cnusmf.' 235

necessity of a great First Cause--an overruling, governing
Power--a secret directing Providence ; and of the equity and
justice of paying homage to Him that 'made us, and the like;
but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an
evil spirit; of his origin, his being, his nature; and, above
all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us'in' to do so
'too : and the poor crmiture puzzled me once in such a manner,
by a question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew]
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to
him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion 'to
sin, llis being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as He had made us all, He could destroy us and all the
world in a moment; and he listened with great seriousnessto
me all the while. After this, I had been telling him how the
devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his
malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and
to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like.
" Well," says Friday, " but you say God is so strong, so great;
is he not much strong, much might as the devil?" " Yes, yes,"
says I, " Friday ; God is stronger than the devil : God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under
our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations and quench
his fiery darts.' ' " But," says he again, " if God much stronger,
much might as the wicked devil, why God no kill the devil, so
make him no more do wicked 2 " I was strangely surprised at
this question ; and, after all, though I was now an old man,
yet I was but a young doctor, and ill qualified for a. casuist, or
a solver of difliculties; and at first I could not tell what to
say ; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he
said : but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his
question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I i
said, " God will at last punish him severely; he is reserved
for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to
dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday ; but
he returns upon me, repeating my words, " ' Reserve at
last /' me no understand: but why not kill the devil now ;
not kill great ago?" " You may as well ask me," said I,
" why God does not kill you or me, when we do wicked
things here that offend Him : we are preserved'to re nt and
be pardoned." He mused some time on this: "Wei , well,"
says he, mightily affectionately, " that well : so you. I, devil.:236 3 mm mo Kore-arenas

'all wicked, all preserve. repent. God pardon all." Here I was
run down again by him to the last degree: and it was a testi-
mony to me. how the more notions of nature, though they will
9guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a
'worsliip or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the
consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation
can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption
purchased for us: of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of
'nn lntorcossor at. tho footstool of God's throne ; I say, nothing
but a revelation from heaven van form these in the soul ; and
' that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God,
promised for the guide and sanetilier of His people, are the
absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the
saving knowledge of God, and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my man, rising up hastily, as upon seine sudden occasion of
going out ; then sending him for something a good way OR, I
seriously prayedl'to God that He would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage ; assisting, by His Spirit, the heart
of ihe poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the know-
ledge of God in Christ reconciling him to Himself, and would
guide me so to speak to him from the Word of God, that his con-
science might beconviiu-ed. his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
\Vhon he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with
him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from
heaven, viz. of repentance towards God,' and faith in our
blessed Lord J onus. I then explained to him as well as I could
why our blessed Redeemer tool: not on him the nature of
angels, but the seed of Abraham: and how, for that reason, the
fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that he came

only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and
must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same
principle will find, that in laying things open to him, 1 really
informed and instructed myself in many things that either I
did not know, or had not fully considered before, but which
occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for
the information of this poor savage; and I had more affection
in my inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt
before: so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better
for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me ; my grief sat lighter upon me; my habitation
'grew comfortable to me beyond measure: and when I re-
flected that in this solitary life which I have been confined to,
Iliad not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to
seek the hand that had brought me here, but was now to be
made an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and,
for aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to
the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine,
that he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; I
say, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran
through every part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that
ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often thought
the most dreadful of all addictions that could possibly have
befallen me. .

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my
time ; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and me was such as made the three years which we
lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be formed in a sublunary
state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much better
than 1 5 though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it,
that we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored peni-
tents. We had here the Word of God to read, and no farther
off from His Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself, in reading the Scripture, to let him
know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read; and he
again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as
I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture know-
ledge than I should ever have been by my own more private
reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here
'lso, from experience in this retired part of my life, viz. how
infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of
God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so
plainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to be received
and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me
directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my
sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a
stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God's
commands, and this without any teacher or instructor. I mean
human; so the same plain instruction sufiiciently served to
the enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to
be such a Christian as I have known few equal to him in
in life.

{is to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention
which have happened in the world about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Church government, they
were all perfectly useless to us, and, for anght I can yet see,
they have been so to the rest of the world. \Ve had the sure
guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God 3 and we had, blessed
be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and.
instructing by His word, leading us into all truth, and making
us both willing and obedient to the instruction of His word.
And I cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of
the disputed points of religion, which have made such confu-
sion in the world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it. But I must go on with the historical part of
things, and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted
him with my own history, or at least so much of it as related
to my coming to this place ; how I had lived there, and how
long; I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave
him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I
made him a. belt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England
we wear hangers in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
seine cases, but much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but
she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him
the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and
which I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was
now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked his
what it was he studied upon. At last says he. " Me see such
boat like come to place at my nation." I did not understand
him a good while; but, at last, when I had examined further
into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had
been, came on shore upon the country where he lived: that
is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of ' weather.
I presently imagined that some European ship must have been
cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and
'drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought 01
men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come : so I only inquired after a description
of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him when he added with some
warmth, "We save the white mans from drown." Then I
presently asked if there were any white mans, as he called
them, in the boat. " Yes," he said ; "the boat full of white
mans." I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers
seventeen. I asked him then what became of them. He told
me, " They live, they dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently
imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called
it; and who after the ship was struck on the rock and they
saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.
Upon this I inquired of him more critically what was become
of them. He assured me they lived still there; that they
had been there about four years; that the savages left them
alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how it
came to pass they did not kill them and eat them. He said,
" No, they make brother with them; " that is, as I understood
him, a truce; and then he added, "They no eat mans but
when make the war fight ; " that is to say, they never eat any
men but such as come to fight with them and are taken in>>
battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence,
as I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or
continent of America, Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of
surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for
I was at some distance from him. I asked him what was the240 ms's AND anvsu'ruans

matter. "0 joy I " says he ; " O glad I there see my country,
there my nation 1 " I observed an extraordinary sense of
pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a
mind to be in his own country again. This observation of
mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me, at
first, not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before. ;
and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his religion,
but all his obligation to me, and would be forward enough to
give his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps,
with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at
which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the
poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry
afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and hold
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar
and kind to him as before: in which I was certainly wrong
too; the honest, grateful creature having no thought about it,
but what consisted with the best principles, both as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared afterwards to
my full mtisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the
new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I found
everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness. he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore
I could not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called
to him, and said, "Friday, do not you wish yourself in your
own country, your own nation?" "Yes," he said, "I be
much 0 glad to be at my own nation." "What would you
do there '1" said I: "would you turn wild again, out men's
flesh again, and be a savage, as you were before? " llo
looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No,
no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to pray God;
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no eat
man again." "Why, then," said I to him, "they will kill
you." He looked grave at that. and then said, "No, no.
they no kill me, they willing love learn." He meant by
this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then]
asked him if he would go back to them.' He smiled at that,
and told me that he could not swim so far. I told him, I
would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if
I Would go with him. " I go ! " says I ; " why they will eat
me if I come there." " No, no," says be, "me make they no
eat you; me make they much love you." He meant, he would
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his life,
and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white men,
or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore there
in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I 'could possibly join with those bearded men, who
I made no doubt were Spaniards and Portuguese ; not doubting
but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company together,
better than I could from an island forty miles off the shore,
alone, and without help. So, after some days, I took Friday
to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would
give him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and, accordingly,
I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the
island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it
sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it him, and we both
went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at
managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again as
I could. So when he was in, I said to him, "Well, now,
Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He looked very dull
at my say ing so; which it seems was because he thought the
boat was too small to go so far. I then told him I had a
bigger; so the next day I went to the place where the .first
boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into
the water. He said that was big enough ; but then, as I had
taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty
years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was rotten.
Friday told me such a heat would do very well, and would
carry "much enough vittle, drink, brea ;"--this was his
way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my
design of going over with him to the continent, that I told

Q.fi! l.h-'.-' \M- \lHlCNI'l'IHs or nunl'w-s rnla'solt.

him wo would go and make mm as big as that, and he should
go home in it. No answored not ono word, but looked very
gnu-e and sad. I asked him what was tho matter with him.
He asked mo again, " \Vhy you angry mad with Friday l--
what mo done'l " [asked him what ho meant. I told hiln
l was not angry with him at all. "No angry!" says ho,
repeating tho words several times; "why send Friday homo
away to my nation?" "\Vhy." says 1. "Friday, did not
you say you wished you wore them?" " Yes. yos," says ho,
" wish we both them; no wish ll'riday "new, no In 'ter
ihore." In a word. he would not think ol going lhore With-
out me. "I go there. l"rida.y'l" says I. "what shall I do
them? " He turned wry quirk upon me at this. " You do
groal, deal nuieh good," says he; "you teach wild mans ho
good. sober. tame mans ; you tell them know (iod. pray ind,
and lire new life." " Alas, Friday ! " says I. " thou know-0st
not what thou sayest; l :uu hut an ignorant man myself."
" Yes. yos." says he. " you toacheo me good, you tom-.heo them
good." " No. no. Friday," says I} " you shall go without mo;
leave me hem to live by myself. as T did lmfore." He looked
eonl'usml again at that word: and running to one of the
hatehots which he used to wear. ho takos it. up hastily. and
giros it to me. " What must I do with this? " says 1 to him.
"You take kill Friday." says he. "\Vhat must 1 kill you
for!" said I again. llo returns very quick ---"\\'hat you
send l-'riilay away for? 'l'ako kill Friday. no send Friday
away." This he. spoko so earnestly that I. saw {oars stand in
his eyos. In a word. I so plainly dis('.o\'erod the utmost
all'ertion in him to mo, and a firm resolution in him. that I
lohl him then. and often after. thatl would nover send him
away from me. il~ he was willing to stay with me.

Upon tho wliulo. as I found by all his discourse a. settled
slim-(ion in mo, and that nothing could part him from mo, so
I found all the foundation of his dosiro to go to his owL.
rountry was laid in his ardent alToct-ion to the pimple. and his
hopes of my doing them good: a thing which, as I had no
notion of myself, so 1' had not tho least thought or intention,
or desire of nndortaking it. But still I found a. strong in-
clination to attempting my escape. founded on the supposition
gathered from the discourse. that there were soventeon bearded
men thin-o : and therefore. without any more delay, I wont to

make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have built a little
fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good large
vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so
near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday
pitched upon a tree; for I found he know much better than
I what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, to this
day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it
was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and
smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this
tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut
it with tools ; which, after I had showed him how to use, he
did very handily; and in about a month's hard labour, we
finished it and made it very handsome; especiall , when,
with our axes, which I showed him how to handl , we cut
and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After
this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her
along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the
water; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty
men with great ease.

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man
Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her along.
So I asked him if he would, and if we might venture over
in her. " Yes," he said, "we venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind." However, I had a farther design
that he knew nothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a
sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to get ; so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which>>
there were great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to'
work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shapm
and order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care.
I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough ;
but as I had had them now six-and-twenty years by me, and
had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining,
that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not
doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces, which appeared
pretty good, and with these I want to work-: and with a.
great doal of pains, and awkward stitching, you may be sure,
for want of needles, 1 at length mado a three-cornered ugly
thing. liko what wo call in England a shoulder-of--mutton sail,
to go with a boom at bottom, and a litth short split at tho
top. each as usually our shipa' long-boats sail with, and such
an 1 best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had
to the boat in which 1 mado my lam-ape from Barbary, as
related in tho first part of my awry.

l was near two months l-orl'orming this last work, viz.
rigging and fitting my mast and soils; for I finished thom
very complelo, making a small stay, and a sail, or form-nail to
it. to asaist if we should turn to windward; and, what was
more than all, I fixed a rudder to tho stern of her to stccr
with. ] was but a bungling shipwright. yotas I know tho
uwfnlness. and oven necessity of such a thing, I applied my-
self wilh so nun-h pains to do it, that at last I brought- it to
pass; though. considering Iho many dull contrivanccs I had
for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as
making lho lvoat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach us
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though
ho knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he know nothing of
what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was the most
amazed when he saw mo work the boat to and again in the sea
by the rudder. and how the sail gibhed, and filled this way or
that way, as (ho courso \vo sailed changed; I say, when he
saw (his, ho stood like one astonished and amazed. llowover,
with a liltle use, I made all these things familiar to him, and
he became an expert sailor, except that of the compass I could
make him understand very littlo. 0n the other hand, as there
was very littlo cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs
in those parts. there was tho less occasion for a compass,
seeing the slurs wero always to be seen by night, and the
shoro by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
cared to stir abroad cit-her by land or sea.

I was now entered on tho soven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with mo ought rather to be left out of the
account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in
all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my land-
ing hero with the same thankfulneas to God for His mercies
as at first: and if 1 had such cause of acknowledgment at
first, I had much more so now, having such additional testi-
monies of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes
I had of being eifeetually and speedily delivered; for I had
an invincible im ression upon my thoughts that my deliver-
ance was at hen , and that I should not be another year in
this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry ; digging,
planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was in the meantime, upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times. We had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the
creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts
from the ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough
to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to
ilont in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she
lay dry as to the tide from the sea: and to keep the rain 0E
we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as
well thatched as a house ; and thus we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by
a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our
voyage ; and intended in a week or a foxtnight's time to open
the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning
upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid
him to go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or
tortoise, a thing which we generally get once a week, for the
sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer
wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps-
he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he ,
cries out to me, " 0 master! 0 master 1 Oserrowl Obadl "--
" What's the matter, Friday?" says I. " 0 yonder there,"
says he, "one, two, three canoes ; one, two, three I " By this
way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but on inquiry
I found there were but three. " Well, Friday," says I, " do
not be frightens ." So I heartened him up as well as I could.
However I saw the poor fellow was most terribly soared, for
nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him,
and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow
trembled so that I scan-eel)! knew what to do with him. I
comforted him as well as 1 could, and told him I was in as
much danger as he. and that they would eat me as well as
him. " lint." says I, " li'riday, we must resolve to fight them.
('an you fight, Friday?" " Me shoot," says he, " but there
come many great number." "No matter for that," said I,
Iagain ; " our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I
asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him. He
said, " Mo die, when you bid die, muster." So I went and
fetched a good drain of rum and gave him ; for I had been so
good a husband of my rum, that 1 had a great deal left. When
he had drunk it, I made him take the two feuding-pieces,
which we always carried, and loaded them with large swan-
shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. Then I took four muskots,
and loaded them with two slugs and live small bullets each;
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each. I
hung my great sword. as usual, naked by my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I
took my perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill,
to see what I could discover; and I found quickly by my
glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three primners,
and three canoes; and that their whole business seemed to be
the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies; a
barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than, as I had
observed, was usual with them. I observed also, that they
had landed, not where they had done when Friday made his
escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came almoxt close down to the sea. This,
with the abhorrenee of tho inhuman errand these wretches
came about, tilled me with such indignation that I came down
again to Friday. and told him I was resolved to go down to
them, and kill them all ; and asked him if he would stand by
me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a
little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very
ehoerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.

In this lit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged,
as before, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his
girdle. and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol-
and the other three. guns myself j, and in this pasture we
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and
as to orders, 1 charged him to keep close behind me, and not
to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the
meantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a
compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over
the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within
shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen
by my glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution :--I do not mean that
I entertained any fear of their number, for, as they were
naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them
--nay, -thongh I had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessit ,
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack peop e
who had neither done or intended me any wrong? who, as to
me, were innocent, and whose barbarous custom were their
own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's having
lof t them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call
me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less
an executioner of His justioe,----that whenever He thought fit
He would take the cause into His own hands, and by national
vengeance punish them as a people for national crimes, but
that, in the meantime, it was none of my busineu,--that it
was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them,--but I could
not say the same with regard to myself. These things were
so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went,
that I resolved I would only go and place myself near them
that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would
not then as God should direct; but that unless something
oflered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would
not meddle with them. '

Witlrthis resolution I entered the wood, and, with all
possible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood on the
side which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and

showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the

..
wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he
could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and
came immediately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there--that they were all about their fire,
eating the llesh of one of their prisoners, and that another loy
bound upon the send u. little from them, whom he said they
would kill next ; and this fired the very soul within me. llo
told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded
men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boot.
I was tilled with horror at the very naming of the white.
'beardod man; and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my]
glass u. white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with 11's
hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and
that he was an European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a. little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where l was,
which, by going a little way about, I sew I might come at un-
discovered, and that then I should be within half a shot of
them; so 1 withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged
to the highest degree; and going back about twenty paces, I
got behind some bushes, which held all the way till 1 came to
the other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which
gave me a full view of them at the distance of about eighty

ards. '
y I had now not it moment to lose, for nineteen oi the dreadful
wrotehes set upon the ground, all close huddled together, and
had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and
bring him perhaps limb by limb to their tire, and they Wore
steeping down to untio the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday :----" New, Friday," said 1, " do as I bid thee." F riduy
said he would. "'l'hen, Friday," says I, " do exactly as you
see me do; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the mus-
kets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did
the like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim at
the savages, bidding him to do the like ; than asking him if
he was ready, he said, " Yes." " Then lire at them," said I 3
and at the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more ;
undon my side I killed one. and wounded two. They were,
you may be sure, in a dreadful muster-nation: and all of them
that were not but iumped upon their feet, but did not
immediately know which way to run, or which way to look,
for they knew not from whence their destruction came.
-Friday kept his eyes close in n me, that, as I had bid him,
he might .observe what I di ; so, as soon as the first shot
was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like ; he saw me cock and present;
he did the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said I.
["Yes," says he. "'Let ily,then," says I, "in the name of
God I " and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches,
and so did Friday ; and as our pieces were now loaded with'
what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only
two drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran about
yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most
of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly
after, though not quite dead.

"New, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, "follow
me," which he did with a great deal of courage; upon which
I rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday
close at my feet. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and
running as fast as ,I:could, which by the way was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as. I was, I made directly towards
the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach or
shore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The
two butchers who were just going to work with him had left
him at the surprise of our 'first fire, and fled in aterrible
fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three
more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday,
and bade him step forwards and fire at them; he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be nearer
them, he shot at them ; and I thought he had killed them all,
for I saw them all .fallof a heap into the boat, though I saw
two of them up again. quickly; however, he killed two of-
them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.

While my man Eriday fired at them, I pulled out my knift'
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his
hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portn.
guess tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin, Chris-
tianus; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand
or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it
him, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and
I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked
him what countryman he wmi : and he said Espagnielo ; and
being a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could
possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his deliver--
aneo. "Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could
make up, " we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now:
if you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword, and
lay ahnut you." lie took them very thankfully; and no
smuer had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they had put
new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury,
and had out two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth
is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they
fell down for more amazement and fear, and had no more
power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to
resist our shot: and that was the case of those five that Friday
shot at in the boat: for as three of them fell with the hurt
they received, so the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being
willingr to keep my charge ready, because I had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword : so I called to Friday, and bade
him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch
the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which he
did with great swiftness; and than giving him my unisket, I
sat down myself to load all the rest again, and hado them
come to me when they wanted. \Vhile I was leading these
pieces. there happened a fierce engagement between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of
their great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have killed .
him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was
as bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak, had'
fought the Indian a good while. and had out two great wounds
on his head; but the savage being a. stout, lusty fellow, clos-
ing in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was
wringing my sword out of his hand; when the Spaniard,
though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol
from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed
him upon the spot. before I, who was running to help him,
could come near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and
with that he despatohed those three who, as I said before,
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could
come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I
gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into the wood, where
Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other
was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might ofi to
those two who were lei t in the canoe ; which three in the canoe,
with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no,
were all that escaped our hands, of one-andtwenty. The
account of the whole is as follows 2--three killed at our first
shot from the tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed
by Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday of those at first
wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three killed by
the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and there,
of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four
escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead--twenty-
one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of
gunshot, and though Friday made two onthree shots at them,
1 did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain
have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and,
indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying
the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps
with two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by
mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and
running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday,
follow me ; but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to
find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as

, the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with
fear, not knowing what was the matter ; for he had not been
able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard
neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really
but little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he
could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believ-
ing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to.be
killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle,
made him give the poor wretch a drum ; which, with the news
of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat.
But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face,
it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how Friday
kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face and head ; and then
sang and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell
am what was the matter ; but when he came a little to
himself, he told me that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered
from death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extrava-
gnnws of his affection after this; for he went into the boat,
and out of the boat, a great many times : when he went in to
him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were
numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was,
gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which
did them a great deal of good.

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now almost out of sight ; and it was
happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two
hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of their
,way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from

the north-west, which was against them, that I could not
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their
own coast. I
lint to relurn to Friday; he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some
time: but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to
the highest extreme: then I asked him if he had given his
father any bread. He shook his head, and said, "None;
igly dog eat all up self." 1 then gave him a cake of bread,
out of a little pouch 1 carried on purpose; I also gave him a
dram for himself ; but he would not taste it, but carried it to
.'his father. 1 had in my pocket two or three bunches of
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He
had no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been
bewitched, for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that
ever I saw: I say, he ran at such a rate that he was out of
sight as it were, in an instant; and though I called, and
hallooed out too, after him, it was all one--away he went;
and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and, as he came nearer, I
found his pace slacker, because he had something in his hand.
\Vhen he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for
an earthen jug or pot, to bring. his father some fresh water,
and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread: the
bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father;
however. as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The
water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had
given him, for he was fainting with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was any water left : he said " Yes; " and I bade him'give'-it
to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want' of it as his
father; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to
the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was re-
posing himself upon a green place under the shade of - a tree;
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled
with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw
that upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up
and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to
him and gave him a handful of raisins: he looked up in my
face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that
could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwith-
standing he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could
not stand up upon his feet: he' tried to do it two' or three
times, but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and
so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused-Friday
to rub his ankles, and bathe them'with mm, as he. had done
his father's; ' ' ' ' ' ' '

I observed the poor affectionate" creature, every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about,
to 'see'if his father was in' the same place and posture as he
left him sitting; and at last he found he was'not to be seen ;
at' which he started up. and, without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his
feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he
only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so
Friday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should mrry him to our dwelling,
where I would take (nu-e of him. But Friday, a lusty strong
fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back, and carried him away
'to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gunnoI v.
of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it ; and then lifting
'him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently
stepping out again. launched the boat off, and paddled it along
the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew
pretty hard too; so he brought them both safe into our creek,
and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him
whither he went. He told me, "Go fetch more boatz" so
away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran
like him ; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as
soon as I got to it by land ; so he waited me over, and then
went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did ;
but they were neither of them able to walk; so that poor
Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling

to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to
me, I soon made a kind of handheld-ow to lay them on, and
Friday and I carried them both up together upon it between
us. -
: But when we got them to the outside of our well, or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was
impossible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break
it down; so I set to work again, and Friday and I, in about
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with
old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that and the
grove of young wood which I had planted; and here we made
them two beds of such thingsas I had; viz. of good rice-
straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them, on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very
rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection, which I fre-
quently made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the
whole country was my own property, so that I had an
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were
perfectly subjected: I was absolutely lord and lawgiver:
they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down
their lives, it there had been occasion for it, for me. It was
remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of
three different religions: my man Friday was a. Protestant,
his father was a Pagan and a cannibul, and the Spaniard was
a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions :--But this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners"
and given them shelter, and a. place to rest them upon, I
began to think of making some provision for them: and the
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat,i
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them 9. very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and
broth; and as I cooked it without-doors, for I made no fire
within my inner wall. so I carried it all into the new tent,
and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate
my own dinner also with them, and, as well as I could,
cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my inter-
preter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard
too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages
pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our mnskcts and
:ther fire-arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the
place of battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the
sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him to
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I
could not think of doing myself: nay, I could not bear to
see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually per-l.
formed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being
there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where
it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to
the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my
two new subjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his
ether what he thought of the escape of the savages in that!
anoe, and whet-her we might expect 0. return of them, with

x
.a power too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that

the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which
blew that night they went off, but must, of necessity, be
drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they
were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if
they were cast away; but, as to what they would do if they
came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but, it was his
opinion, that they were so dreadfully frightened with the
'manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that
he believed they would tell the people they were all killed by
thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that
the two which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were two heavenly
spirits, or inries, come down to destroy them, and not men
with weapons. This, he said he knew; because he heard
them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it
was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart
fire, and speak thunder, and hill at a distance, without lifting
up the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in
the right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the
savages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards,
they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four
men (for it seems they did escape the see), that they believed
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed
with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and
therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, with all my army: for, as
there were new four of us, I would have ventured upon a
hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time.

In a. little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the
fear of their coming were off 3 and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; being;
ilikewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend
upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would
'go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and
Portuguese, who having been cast away and made their
escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the
savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and,
indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars of their
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the
Rio do la Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring

back what European goods they could meet with there; that

they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took

out of another wreck; that five of their own men were

drowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped

through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost

starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have}
been devoured every moment. He told me they had some'
arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that-g
they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the seai
having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used

at their first lending, to provide themselves with some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if they had formed any design of making their escape.
He said they had many consultations about it; but that
having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions
of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done. I told him with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me,
if I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always
square their dealings by the obligations they had received, so
much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told
him it would be very hard that I should be the instrument
of their deliverance, and that they should afterwards make
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was
certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident
soever brought him thither; and that I had rather be do:
livered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall
into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into
the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded, if
they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a
barque large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils
southward, or to 'the islands or Spanish coast northward ; but
that if, in rcquital, they should, when I had put weapons into
their hands, (rm-y me by force among their own people, I
might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my case
worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuous'
ness. that their condition was so miserable, and that they

a 2
wore so sensible of it, that ho beliovod they would abhor the
thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to
their delireramve; and that, if 1 pleased, he would go to
them. with the old mun. and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer; that he would
make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they
should be absolutely under my direction, as their commander
and captain ; and they should swear upon the holy sacraments
and gospel, to be true to mo, and go to such Christian country
as I should agree to, and no other; and to ho directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in
such country as l intended; and that ho would bring it con-
trurt from them. under their hunds, for that purpose. Then
he told me he would iirst swear to me himself, that he would
novor stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders;
and that he would take my side to the lust drop of his blood,
it there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest. men. and they were under the greatest distress
imaginable. having noither Weapons nor elothos. nor any food.
but at the mercy and discretion of tho savages; out of all
hopes of over returning to their own country; and that ho
was sure. if I would undertake their relief, they would live
and die by me.

Upon these assurances. .I resolved to venture to relieve
them. if possible, nnd to send tho old savage and this
Spaniard over to them to trout. But when we had got all
things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an oh-
jeetion, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so
min-h sincerity on the other hand. that 1 could not but he very
wrll satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put. oil the deliverance
n!" his romrados for at least half a year. The case was thus :
h>> had been with us now about a month, during which time

vl hail ht. him we in what manner I had provided. with the
assistant-e of J'rnridem-e. for my support; and he saw evi-
dently what stool: of corn and rice I had laid up; which.
though it was more than sullirirnt for myself, yet it was not
suttirient. without good hushmnlry. for my family, now it was
invreased to four; but mueh less would it be suilieient if his

our Vessel. if we should build one. for a voymve to NW of II itor 30131830}! causes 261

Christian colonies of America; so he told me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to
cow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen. when they should
come ; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or.
not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one
diiliculty into another. " You know," says he, " the children
of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being de-
livered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself,
that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the
wilderness."

Jlis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging, all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted ; and, in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and
trimmed up, as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley
on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed
we had to spare: indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient
for our own food for the six months that we had to expect
our crop ; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our
seed aside for sowing ; for it is not to be supposed it is six
months in the ground in that country.

Having new society enough, and our number being sufficient
to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, whenever we found occasion; and as we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible,'
at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For
this purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought fit
for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them
,down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I im
my thoughts on that alfair, to oversee and direct their work.
I showed them with what indefatigable pains 1 had hewed a
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the
like, till they made about a dozen large planks of good oak,
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two
inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour it took
up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could; and for this purpose, I made
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with
Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this
means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for
curing the grain-s coming on. I 'aused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the. sun. that, l believe, had we
liven at Alieant. where the raisins of the sun are cured, we
could have filled sixty or eighty lmrrola ; and these. with our
broad, formed a great part of our fwd--very good living too.
.1 assuro you, for thoy aro exceedingly nourishing.

It was now harvest. and our crop in good order : it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in tho island, but,
however. it was enough to answer our end; for, from twrnty-
two bushels of harloy we brought in and thrashed out a1:ovo
two hundred and twenty bushels ; and the like in proportion
of tho rive ; which was Moro enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all tho sixteen Spaniards had been on shore
with me; or. if wo had been ready for a voyage, it would
vary plentifully haro vietnallod our ship to have carried us
to any parl- of the world, that is to say. any part of America.
When we had thus housod and secured our magazine of corn,
we fell to work to make more wicker-warn, viz. grmt baskets,
in which wo kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
doxtorous at this part, and often blamed me that. I did not
mako some things for defence of this kind of work; but I
now no need of it.

And now. having a full xupply of food for all the guests I
expected. 1 gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to
see what he could do with those he had left behind him there.
I gave him a strict charge. not to bring any man who would
not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old savage,.
that ho would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the
person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to
send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they
would Maud by him and defend him against all such attempts,
and wherever they went, would be entirely under and sub-
jectod to his command; and that this should be put in
'writing. and signed in their hands. How they were to have
douo this, when I know they had neither pen nor ink, was a
question which we never asked. Under these instructions,OF 30313801! 030808. 268

the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, went'
away in one of the canoes which they might be said to have
come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of
them a musket, with o. firelock on it, and about eight charges
of powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands
of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent
occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for new twenty-seven years
and some days. I gave them provisions of breed, and of
dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and
sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time;
and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing
with them about a signal they should hang out at their
return, by which I should know them again, when they came
back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They went
away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full,
by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact
reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never
recover it again; not had I kept even the number of years
so punctuully as to be sure I was right; though, as it proved,
when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept
a true reckoning of years.

It was no loss than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the
like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast
asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday come
running in to me, and called aloud, "Master, master, they
are come, they are come! " I jumped up, and, regardless of
danger, I w'ent as soon as I could get my clothes on, through'
my little grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown.
to be 9. very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I went
without my arms, which was not my custom to do: but I was',
surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw
a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in
for the shore, with a. shoulder-'of--mutton soil, as they call it,
and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I
observed, presently, that they did not come from that side
which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close,
for these were not the people we looked for. and that we might
not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In tho
next. place. l went in to fetch my porswctive glass. to see whnt
] could make of them: mnl. having taken the ladder out. I
climbed up to the top of the hill. as I used to do when l was
apprehensive of anything. and to take my view the plainel'.
without being discovered. I had scarce set. my foot upon the
hill. when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at. anchor.
at about two lengues and a hull distance from me. 8.8. 3.. but.
.not nbovo a lengno and a half from the shore. By my obsexh
\"nt-ion it. npiwm'od plainly to be an English ship, and the bout
appeared to be an English lung boat.

I cannot express the confusion l was in. though the joy of .
seeing a ship, and onethat. I had reason to believe wax-manned
by my own countrymen. and ('UHSNIllt'Ili-ly friends. was such
as l ennnot, describe: but- yet i luul some secret doubts hung
about- nio I cannot tell from whence they come bidding nio
keep upon my guard. in the first>> place. it occurred to me to
consider what. business an English ship could have in that
port. of the world, since it was not the Wily to or from any
port of the world where the l'lnglish had any tmllic: and I
knew there had been no storms to drive them in there. in
distress: and that, if they were really English. it was most
probable that they were here upon no good design ; and that.
I had better continue as l was, than hill into the hands of
thieves and nmrdemrs.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger
which sometinws are given him when he may think there is
no possibility of its being real. That such hints and not-ices
are given us, I believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny -. that they are certain discoveries of an
invisible world. and n converse of spirits. we cannot doubt ;
'nnd if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent
(whether supreme. or inferior and subordinate, is not the
question). and that they are given for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice
of this reasoning; for had I not been made motions by this
secret admonition, como it from whence it will, I had been
undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before,
as you will see presently. 1' had not kept myself long in
this posture. till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if
they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of
lending; however, as they did not come quite far enough,

they did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my

rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about

half a mile from me; which was very happy for me; for

otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may

say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and

perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were/
on shore, 1 was fully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least -
most of them ; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did

not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of

them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, hound ; and

when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,.
they took those three out of the boat, as prisoners: one of

the three I could perceive using the most pessiomte gestures

of entreaty. allliction, and despair, even to a kind of extra-

, vagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their

hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to

slu'll 21 degree as the first. I was perfectly confounded at the

sight, and knew not what the manning of it should be.

Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, " 0

master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage

mans." " Why Friday," says I, " do you think they are going

to eat them, then?" "Yes," says Friday, "they will eat
them." "No, no," says I, "Friday ; I em afraid they will

murder them, indeed ; but you may be sure they will not eat

them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was. but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, ex-
pecting every moment when the three prisoners should be
killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm
with a great cutluss, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike
one of the poor men; and I on ted to see him fall every
moment; at which all the bloc in my body seemed to run
chill in my veins. I wished heartily new for the Spaniard,
and the savage that was gone with him, or that I had any way
to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might.
have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had
among them ; but it fell out to my mind another way. After
I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the
insolent senmen, I observed the fellows run scattering about
the island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed
that the three other men hedliberty to go also where they
pleased; but they .xnt down all three upon the ground, very
pensive, and looked like men in deslmir. This put me in
mind of the first time when l eume on shore, end hogan to
Hook about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly
I looked round me ; what dreadful apprehensions I hud ; and
how I' lodged in the tree all night, for four of being devoured
by wild beasts. As 1 know nothing, that night, of the
supply I was to receive by the providentiul driving of the
ship nearer the hold by the storms and tide, by which 1 have
since been so long nourished and supported; so these three
poor desolate men know nothing how certain of delivemnce
and supply they were, how near it was to them, and how
oll'octunlly and really they were in :1 condition of safety, at
the some Limo that they thought themselves lost. and their
(use deslmrnte. So little do we see before us in the world,
and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the
grout Maker of the world. that lle does not leave His
creatures so absolutely destitute. but that, in the worst Cir-
cumstances, they have :ilwuys something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer deliverance than they imagine; nay,
are even brought to their deliverance 'hy the menus by whieh
they seem to he brought to their destruction.

It was just at. high-water when those people come on shore;
and while they rambled about to see what kind of u. place
they were in. they had carelessly stayed till the tide was
spent. and the water was ebhrd considerably nu'uy. leaving
their host ngreund. They had left. two men in the boat, who,
as I. found often-words, having drunk a little too much brandy,
fell asleep; however, one of them waking n. little sooner than
the other. and finding the bout too fast aground for him to
stir it. hallooed out for the rest, who were struggling about;
upon which they all soon came to the bout : but it was past
all their strength to launch her, the boot being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oozy mud, almost like
a quieksnnd. In this condition. like true seaunen, who ere,
poi-Imps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they
gave it over, and away they strolled about the country again ;
and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them
oi? from the boat, "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you?
she'll lloot next tide :" by which I was fully confirmed in the
main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this while
I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my
castle, any farther than to my place of observation, near the
top of the hill : and very glad I was to think how well it was
fortified. I knew it was no loss than ten hours before tho
boat could float again. and by that time it would be dark, and
I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear
their discourse, if they had any. In the meantime, I fitted
myself up for a battle, as before, though with more caution}
knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had
at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an ex-
cellent marksman with his gun, to lead himself with arm's.
I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have
mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt,
and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the
heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to aloe . The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con ition to
get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a
great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I
thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I
resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of
their condition; immediately I marched as above, my man
Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his
arms as I, but not making quite so staring n. spectre-like
figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could
and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them
in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen l " They started up at
the noise, but were ten times more confounded when they
saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. They made
no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English: "Gentle-
men," said I, " do not be surprised at me ; perhaps you may
have a friend near, when you did not expect it." " He must
be sent directly from Heaven then," said one of them very
gravely to me, and pulling 0% his hat at the some time to me;
"for our condition is past the help of man." "All help is
from Heaven, sir," said I: "but can you put a stranger in
the way to help you? for you seem to be in some great
distress. I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed
to make application to the brutos that came with you, I saw
one of them lift up his sword to kill you." .

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looked like one astonished, returned, " Am I
talking to God, or man? Is it a real man, or an angel 2 "--
" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I; "if God had sent an
angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and

your fears; I am a, man, an Englishman, and disposed to
aSSist you ; you see I have one servant only; we have arms
and ammunition ; tell us freely, can we serve you? \Vhat is
your case?" "Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell
you, while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I
was commander of that ship: my men have mutinied against
me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me,

.
and, at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with
these two men with mo,--ono my mate, the other a. passenger,
whero we expected to perish, believing the place to be unin~
huhited, and know not yet what to think of it." "Where
are these hrutos, your enemies 'l " said I ; " do you know where
they are gone?" " There they lie, sir," said he. pointing to a
thicket of treex; " my heart tremblos for fear they have seen
'us, and heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all." "Have they any firearms?" said 1. 1-10
'unswerod, "They had only two pieces, one of which they left
in tho hoot." " Well, then," said I, "leave tho rest to me;
1 see they are all asleep; it is on (my thing to kill them all ;
but shall we rut-her take them prisoners?" He told me
there were two desperate villains among them that it was
scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if they were secured,
he believed all the rest would return to their duty. I asked
him which they were. He told me he. could not at that
distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in
anything I would direct. "Well," says I, "let us retreat
out of their view or hearing. lest they awake, and we will
resolve further." So they willingly went back with me, till
the woods covered us from them.

"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your do-
livemnce, are you willing to make two conditions with me? "
Ho anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com-
manded by me in everything; and if the ship was not
recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of
the world scorer I would send him; and the two other men
said the some. "Well," says I, "my conditions are but
two; lirst,--thut while you stay in this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in '
your hoods, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me,
and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in?
tho nunntime be governed by my orders; sccondly,----tha.t if
the ship is or my be recovered, you will carry me and my
man to England pissnge free."

No guru me all the msumucos that the invention or faith
of 1mm could devise that he would comply with these most
1'4':t.~'0l\ul)lu demands, and besides would owe his life to me, .
and acknowledgo it upon nll occasions as long us he lived.

it was in vain to rosist, they bogged for morcy, Tho captain
told them he would spare their lives if they would give him
an assurance of their abhorrencc of the treachery they had-
been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in re-.
covering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to'
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the'
protestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he
was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which 1'
was not against, only that I obliged him to keep them bound
hand and foot while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the caphin's.
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away
'the ears and sails, which they did; and by-and-by three
straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from the
rest, came back upon hearing the guns tired; and seeing the
captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror,
they submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was
complete.

It now remained that the captain and I should in uire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and tol him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to
amazement,--and particularly at the wonderful manner of
my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it
affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence
upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there
on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and
he could not speak a word more. After this communication
was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my apart-
ment, leading them in just where I came out, viz., at the top
of the house, where I refreshed him with such provisions as
I had, and showed them all the ccntrivances I had made
during my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but above all, the captain admired my fortification,
and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of
trees, which having been new planted nearly twenty years,
and the trees growing much faster than in England, was
become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in any
part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and
my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most
princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I272 mm mu anvrsruau

would show him that too another time; but at present our

business was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed

with me as to that. but told me he was perfectly at a loss

what measures to take. for that there were still eix-and-twenty

hands on board. who, having entered into n. cursed conspiracy,

by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would

be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, .
knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to

the gallows as soon as they mime to England, or to any of the
English colonies. and that. therefore, there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.

1 mused for some time on what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion. and that therefore something
Was to be resolved on slx'cdily, as well to draw the men on
board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their
landing upon us. and destroying us. Upon this, it presently
occurred to me that in a little while the ship's crew, wonder-
ing what was become of their comrades and of the boat,
would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for
them, and that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and
be too strong for us: this he allowed to be rational. Upon
this, I told him the. first thing we had to do was to stave the
boat. which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry
her oli, and taking everything out of her. leave her so far
useless as not to be lit to swim. Accordingly we went on
board. took the arms which were left on board out of her,
and whatever else we found tliore,~-u'hich was a bottle of
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of
powder. and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the
sugar was live or six pounds) : all which was very welcome to
me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which 1 had had none
left for many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the care,
must, sail, and rudder of the boat Were carried away before),
we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry ed the
boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could
be able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, 1 did not much question to make
her again fit to carry us to the leeward Islands, and call upon
our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still
my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first,
by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high
that the tide would not float her off at high-water mark, and
besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped. and were set down musing what we should do, we
heard the ski lire a gun, and make a wait with her ensign
as a signal or the bent to come on board: but no heat
stirred; and they fired several times, making other signals
for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved
fruitless, and they found the boot did not stir, we saw them
by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row'
towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that
there were no less than ten men in her, and that they had
fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they come, and a plain sight even of
their faces ; because the tide having set them a little to the
east of the other bout, they rowed up under shore, to come to
the same place where the other had landed, and where the
boat lay ; by this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the
men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very
honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy
by the rest, being overpowered and frightened; but that as
for the hoatswain, who it seems was the chief oficer among
lhom, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new
enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would
be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that
mm in our circumstances were past the operation of fear;
that seeing almost every condition that could be was better
than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect.
that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to
be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the cir~
cumstanees of my life, and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for! "And where, sir," said I, "is your
belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your
life, which elevated you a little while agol For my part,"
said I, "there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the'

respect of i ." "What is that i " says he. " Why," said
, " it is, that as you lay there are three or four honest fellows
among them, which should be spared, had they bee: all of
the wicked part of the crow, I should have thought God's
providence had singled them out to deliver them into your
ands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is
our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us." As I
spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance,
I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to
our business.
' We had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming from
he ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and we had,
indeed. secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom the
captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday,
and one of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods, if they
could have delivered themselves: here they left them bound,
but gave them provisions; and promised them, if they con~
tinned there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two;
but that if they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their
oontlnement with patience, and were very thankful that they
had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them ;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for
their comfort: and they did not know but that he stood
sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were
kept pinionod. indeed, beauise the captain was not able to
trust them: but the other two were taken into my service,
upon the captain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly
engaging to live and die with us ; so with them and the three
honest men we were seven men, well armed; and 1 made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were coming. considering that the mptain had said there were
three or four honest men among them also. As soon as they'
got. to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their
boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the beat
up after them, which I was glad to see. for I was afraid they
would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so
we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the
first thing they did. they ran all to their other boat; and it
was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find
her stripped, as almre, of all that was in her, and a great

' V
hole in her bottom. After they had mused a. while'upon this,
they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions hear ; but
all was to no purpose : then they came all close in a ring, and
fired a, volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard,
and the echoes made the woods ring : but it was all one;

those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear ; and those in
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give
no answer to them. They were so astonished at the surprise
of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the

men were all murdered, and the long-boat stayed 3 accordingly,

volley <<gain. to endeavour to make their fellow hm, MI
that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when
their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked
this proposal, provided it was done while we were nenr enough
to come up to them before they could lead their pieces again.
But this event did not happen; and we lay still a long time,
very irresolute whet course to take. At length, I told them
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might
find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratugem with them in the boat to get them on
shore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for
their removing; and were very uneasy, when, after long con-
sultation, we saw them all start up, and march down towards
the sea: it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
with their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I ima-
gined it to be as it really was, that they had given over their
<<mob, and were going back again ; and the captain, as soon
as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the appro-
hensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem to
fetch them back main, and which answered my end to a
tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over
the little creek westward, towards the place where the savages
came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so soon as they
came to alittle rising ground, at about half amile distance,
I bade them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till
they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again ;
and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answeringi
when the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island ,
and among the woods as possible, and. then wheel about again
to me by such ways as I directed them. =

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hellooed; and they presently heard them, and, answering.
ran along the shore westward, towards the voice they heard,
when they were stopped by the creek, where, the water being
up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come
up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When they
had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone
a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour
within the land, they took one of the three men out of her,
to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This
was what I wished for ; and immediately leaving Friday and
the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me;
,and, crossing the creek out of their sight. we surprised the
two men before they were aware--one of them lying on the
shore, and the other being in the boat. The follow on shore
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up; the
captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked
him down; and then called out to him in the boat to yield,
or he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to
persuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
him, and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny
as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded
not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with
us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,
by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were very sure they could not
reach back to the boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they
were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came
back to us.

We had nothing new to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they mine quite u , calling to
those behind to come along; and could also hear em answer,
and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to
come any faster: which was very welcome news to us. At
length they came up to the boat: but it is impossible to
express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gene. We
could hear them call one to another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits
in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They halloocd again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times; but no answer. After some time,
we could see them, by the little light there was, run about,
wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they
would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then
come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same
thing over again. My men would fain have had me, give
them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage, so as to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was
unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing
the others were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see
if they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them,
I drew my ambusoade nearer, and ordered Friday and the
mptain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the
ground as they could, that they might not be discovered, and
get as near them as they could possibly, before they ofiered to
fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of
all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of
the crew; the captain was so eager at having this principal
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience
to lethim come so near as to be sure of him, for they only
heard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the
captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was
shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it. At the
noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army;
which was now eight men; viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday,
my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We
came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not
see our number; and I made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if
I could bring them to a ley and so perhaps might reduce
them to terms; which fel out just as we desired: for, indeed,
it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would
be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he
could to one of them, " Tom Smith! Tom Smith! " Tom280 LIFE AND ADVEN'l'uul-Js

Smith answered immediately, "Is that Robinson'l" for it
seems he knew the Voice. The other answered, " Ay, fly; for
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or
you are all dead men this moment." "Who must we yield
to? \Vliero are they?" says Smith again. "Here they are,"
says he; "here's our captain and fifty men with him, have
been hunting you those two hours; the bontswain is killed,
Will Fry is wounded. and I am a prisoner; and if you do
not yield, you are all lost." " \Vill they give us quarter
then'l " says Tom Smith, "and we will yield." " I'll go and
ask, if you promise to yieli ," said Robinson : so he asked the
captain; and the cnptain himself then calls out, "You,
Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down your arms
immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but
Will Atkins."

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter ; what have I done? They have all been as
bad as I : " which, by tho way, was not true ; for, it seems,
this \Vill Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the
captain, when they first inutinied, and used him hirbzirously,
in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. How-
ever, tho captain told him he must lay down his arms at
discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy: by which he
meant me, for they all called me governor. In a word. they
all laid down their arms, and begged their lives ; and I sent
the man that had parloyed with them, and two more, who
bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which.
with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized
upon them, and upon their boat; only that I kept myself and
one more out of sight, for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of
their practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of
their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As
for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the
commander's of the island; that they thought they had set
him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that
the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them
all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all Quarter,
he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
manded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning.

Thong. this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its
desired oifect ; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain
to intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest
begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship; so
I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see
what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me ; when I called, ata good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the
commander calls for you ; " and presently the captain replied,
"Tell his Excellency, I am just coming." This more perfectly
amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was
just by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me,
I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next
morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners,
and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the
worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the
others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men
who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to
the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place,
especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered
to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full
description: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned,
the place was secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the
injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and
that though the governor had given them quarter for their
lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to282 mes AND Amnuruurs

England they would all be hanged in chains; but that if they
would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he
would have the governor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impre~
cations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him as

la father to them as long as they lived. "Well," says the
captain, " I must go and tell the governor what you say, and
see what I can do to bring him to consent to it." So he
brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and
that he verily believed they would be. faithful. However,
that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back
again and choose out these five, and tell them, that they
might see he did not want men, that he would take out those
five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep
the other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the
mstle (my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and
that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five
hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This
looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in
earnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept
it ; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as
of the captain. to persuade the other five to do their duty. '

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:
first, the captain, his mate, and passenger: second, the two
prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their character
from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them
with arms : third, the other two that I had kept till now in
my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, had now
released: fourth, these five released at last; so that they were
twelve in all, besides live we kept prisoners in the cave for
hostages. '

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship; but as for me and my man Friday,
.1 did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men
left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep
them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five
in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in
twice a day to them, to supply thorn with necessaries; and I
made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take them.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them; and that it was the governor's
pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction;
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and
be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me
as governor, I new appeared as another person, and spoke of
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all
00011330113.

The captain now had no difiiculty before him, but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He
made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men; and
himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they
contrived their business very well, for they came up to the
ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call of
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had
brought OR the men and the boat, but that it was along time
before they had found them, and the like; holding them in a
chat till they came to the ship's side; when the captain and
the mate entering first with their arms, immediately knocked
down the second mate and carpenter with the buttend of
their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-
decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down
that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering
at the forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three
men they found there prisoners. When this was done, and all
safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain
lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up,-and with two
men and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands; and when
the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain
and his men fired boldly among thorn, and wounded the mate
with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two
more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling for
help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded as he
was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the
head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more:284 1.er AND linvsx'ruaes

upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually,
without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured. the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me to give mo notion of his success, which, you may be sure,
1 was very glad to hmr, having sat watching upon the shore
for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus
hoard the signal plainly, I laid mo down; and it having been
a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound. till I was
surprised with the muse of a gun: and presently skirting up,
I heard a man tall me by the name of " Governor! Governor! "
aml presently I know the captain's voice; when, climbing up
to tho top of tho hill, there he stood, and, printing to the
ship. he embraced mo in his arms. " My dear friend and
deliverer," slys ho, "there's your ship; for she is all yours,
and so are We, and all that belong to her." I mat my eyes to
the ship. and there she rodo. within little more than half a
mile of tho shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as
they were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had
brought her to an anchor just against tho mouth of the little
creek; and, tho tide being up, the captain had brought the
pinnace in near the place where 1 had first landed my rafts,
and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink
down with tho surprise: for I saw my deliverance. indeed,
visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a largo ship
just ready to carry me away whither l pleased to go. At
first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word ;
but as he had taken me in his arms, I hold fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived tho surprise,
and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave
me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for
.me. After 1 had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground ; and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while
before I could speak a word to him. All this time tho poor
man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under any
surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender
things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such
was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits
into confusion : at last it broke out into tears ; and, in a little
while after, I recovered my speech. I then took my turn,
and embraced him as my dolivoror, and we rejoiced together.
I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven toor nonmsou 0303014. 285

chain of wonders; that such things as these were the testi-
momes we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the

Worm, anti an evidence that the eye of an infinite Power
could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send
help to the miserable wheneVer He 'leased. I forgot not to
lift up my heart in thankfulness to amen) end when heart
could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous
manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a
desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed.

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters
had not plundered him of. Upon this, be called aloud to the
boat. and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for
the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if 1 had been
one that was not to be carried away with them. but as if
I had been to dwell upon the island still. First. he had
brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters,
six large bottles of M adeira wine (the bottles held two quaris
each), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a
bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also
brought me a box of sugar. a box of flour, a bag full of
lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundaneo of
other things. But besides these, and what was a thousand
limos more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts,
six vor ' good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes,
a. hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in
a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind
and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in my
circumstances, but never was anything in the world of that
kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to
wear such clothes at first.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for"
,it was worth considering whether we might venture to take
them away with us or no. especially two of them, whom he
know to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree ; and
the captain said he know they were such rogues that there
was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must
be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at
the first English colony he could come to; and l found that
the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this. I
told him that. if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the
two men he spoke of In make it their own request that he
should leave them upon the island. "I should be very glad
of the ," says the captain, "with all my heart." "Well,"
says I, " I will send for them up, and talk with them for you.
So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now
discharged, their comrades having performed their promise ;
I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five
men, pinionsd as they were, to the bower, and keep them '
,there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed
in my new habit ; and new 1 was called governor again.
3Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men
"to be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full
'acoount of their villanons behaviour to the captain, and how
they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to
commit farther robberies, but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit
which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my
direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the
road; and they might see by-and by that their new captain
had received the reward of his villany, and that they would
see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted
to know what they had to say why I should not execute them
as pirates taken in the fact, as by my commission they could
not doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the
captain promised them their lives, and they humbly implored
my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show
them ; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with
all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for
England ; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to
England, other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for
mutiny and running away with the ship; the consequence of
which, they must needs know, would be the gallows; so that
I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had a
mind to take their fate in the island. If they desired that, as
I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to
give them their lives, if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would
much rather venture to stay there than be carried t4) England
to be hanged. So I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this, I seemed a
little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my
prisoners, not his , and that seeing I had offered them so much
favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did
not think lit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I
found them; and if he did not like it, he might take them
again if he could catch them. Upon this, they appeared very
thankful. and l accordingly set them at liberty, and bade
them retire into the woods. to the place whence they (rune,
and I would leave them some lire-arms, some ammunition, and
some directions how they should live very well, if they thought
tit. Upon this 1 prepared to go on board the ship; but told
the captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and
desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all
right in tho ship, and send the beat on shore next day for
me; ordering him, at all events. to cause the new captain,
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him.

When the captain wm gone. I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them
on their circumstances. i told them I thought they had made
a right choice; that if the captain had carried them away,
they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new
captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them
they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them I would let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them.
Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and
of my coming to it : showed them my fortifications, the way
I made my bread. planted my corn. cured my grapes ; and, in
a word, all tlnt was necessary to make them easy. I told
them the story also of the seventcen Spaniards that were to
he expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise
to treat them in connnen with themselves. Here it may be
noted that the captain, who had ink on board, was greatly
surprised that 1 never hit upon a way of making ink of char-
coal and water, or of something else, as I' had done things
much more dillicult.

i left them my tire arms. viz. five muskots, three fowling~
pieces, and three swords. 1 had above a barrel and a half of
powder left ; for after the first year or two 1 used but little,
And Wanted none. I gave them a description of the way I
managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them,
and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them
every partof my own story; and told them I should prevail
with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seeds, which I told them I would have
been very glad of. Also. I gave them the bag of peas which
the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to
sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did
not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of the
five men came swimming to the ship's side, and, making the
most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be
taken into the ship for God's unite, for they should be murdered,
and begged the captain to take them on board, though be
hanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pre-
tended to have no power without me; but after some difficulty,
and after their solemn promises of amendment. they were taken
on board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and
pickled; after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to which
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes
to be added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my
gave:- to send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget

em.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
reliques, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots ; also, I forgot not to take the money
I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless
that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also
the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And'
thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by
the ship's amount, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it
eight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being
ldelivered from this second captivity the same day of the
month that I first made my escape in the long-boat from
among the Moore of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long
voyage, 1 arrived in England the llth of June. in the year
1687, having been thirty- five years absent. 1-:_".H) mm>>: AND AMIiX'I'nul-zs or uunmsoN ransom.

grown old, and had left off going to sea, having put his son.'
who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still
used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; and
indeed, I hardly knew him. But I soon brought him to my
remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance,
when I told him who I was. -
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation
and my partner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could assure
me, that when he came away my partner was living; but the
trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of
my part, were both dead: that, however, he believed I would
have a very good account of the improvement of the planta-
tion; for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the
produce of my part of the plantation to the proourator-fiscal,
who had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it,
one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of
St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but
that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inherit-
ance, it would be restored; only that the improvement, or
annual production being distributed to charitable uses, could
not be restored: but he assured me that the steward of the
king's revenue from lands, and the providers, or steward of
the monastery, had taken great care all along that the incum-
bent, that is to say, my nor, gave every year a faithful
account of the produce, 0 which they had duly received my
moiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation, and whether he thought
it might be worth looking after; or whether, on my going.
thither, I should meet With any obstruction to my possessing
my just right in the moiety. He told me he could not tell
exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but this
he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the
enjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his remem-
brance, he had heard that the king's third of my part, which
was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery or
religious house, amounted to above two hundred moidores 9.
year: that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it,
there was no question to be made of that, my partner being
alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in
the register of the country; also he toll me that the sur-
vivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and
very wealthy; and he believed I would not only have their
assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very
considerable sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the
trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he
remembered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this
account, and inquired of the old captain how it (rune to pass
that the trustees should thus dispoee of my efiects, when he
knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, <<he.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some
certain account should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to inter-meddle with a thing so remote: that
it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim;
and could he have given any account of my being dead or
alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken posses-
sion of the ingenio (so they call the eugaihhouse), and have
given his son. who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it.
"But," siys the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world
believing so also, your partner and trustees did ofier to account
with mo, in your name, for the first six or eight years' profits,
which I received. There being at that time great disburse-
ments for increasing the works, building an ingenio, and
buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as after-
wards it produced: however," says the old man, "I shall
give you a true account of what I have received in all, and
how I have disposed of it."

After a few days' further conference with this ancient
friend, he brought me an account of the first six years'
income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the
merchamt-trustees, being always delivered in goods, viz.
tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses,
Jw. which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found
by this account, that every year the income considerably
increased; but, as above, the disbursements being large, the"l" "0!!leth (:mrsolt. 295

sum at. am was small : however, the old man let me see that
he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of
gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of
tobacco, which were lost in his ship; ho having been ship-
wrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my-
loaving the place. The good man then began to complain of
his misfortunes, and how ho had been obliged to make use of
my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a
new ship. "However, my old friend," says he, "you shall
not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son
returns, you shall be fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls out
an old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal
moidores in gold; and giving the writings of his title to the
ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he
was quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them
both into my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man to be able to bear this; and remembering what
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and lrirticularly
how sincere a friend he was new to me, 1 could hardly refrain
weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore I asked him if
his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at
that time, and if it would not straiten him '1 He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little; but, however,
it was my money, and I might want- it more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of afl'eetion, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and
ink to give him a receipt for them : then I returned him the
rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation
I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I after-
wards did) ; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's ship, 1 would not take it by any means; but that if I
wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me ;
and if I did not, but (nine to receive what he gave me reason
to expect, I would never have a. penny more from him. '

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should
put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation. I
told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might
do so if I pleased; but that, if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate
the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river of
Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter
my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming,
upon oath, that 1 was alive, and that I was the same person
who took up the land for the planting the said plantation at
first. This being regularly attested by a notary, and a pro-
euration ailixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his
writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and
then proposed my staying with him till an account came of
'ho return.

Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in loss than seven months I
received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, tho
merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which were
the following particular letters and papers inclosed.

First, there was tho account-current of the produce of my
form or plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years;
the balance amx'ared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidoros in my favour.

fi-coxully, there was the account of four years more, while
they kept the ell'ccts in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration. as being the effects of a person
not to be found, which they called civd death; and the
balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,
amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six
urusadees, being about three thousand two hundred and forty
moidorcs.

'l'hirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account,
who had received the profits for above fourteen years; but
not being able to account for what was disposed of by the
hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and
ueventy~two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged
to my account : as to the king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how
the estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with
(he particnlm-s of the number of squares or acres that it con-
(aim-ll. how planted. how many slaves there were upon it: and
making two andrtwenty crosses for blessings, told me he had
said so many Arr llIu-rz'us to thank the Blessed Virgin that I
was alive; inviting me very lxissionately to come over and
take possession of my own; and, in the meantime, to give
him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself ; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend.

ship, and that of his family; and sent me, as a present, seven.

fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and
which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent
me also five chests of excellent swcotmeats, and a hundred
pieces of gold uneoined, not quite so large as moidores. By:
the same fleet, In two merchanttrusues shipped me one
thousand two hun red chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job
was better than the beginning. It is impossible to express
the flutterings of my very heart when I found all my wealth
about me; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same
ships which brought my letters brought my goods: and the
efiects were safe in the river before the letters came to my
hand. In a word. I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had
not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the
sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died
upon the spot: nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was
so some hours, till a. physician being sent for, and something
of the real muse of my illness being known, he ordered me to
be let blood ; after which I had relief, and grew well : but I
verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.

I was new master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well
call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in England: and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how
to compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing
I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old!
captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress.
kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. I
showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him that, next to
the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned to him
the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for
a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or

 

'fi
discharge from the four hundred and seventy moidoros, which
he had iwknowlodgod he owed mo, in the fullest and firuiost
manner possible. After which, I caused o. procumtion to be
drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation ; and appointing my partner to
account with him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets.
to him in my name ; and by a clause in the end. made a grant
of one hundred moidoros a your to him during his life. out of
the oll'ects, and fifty moidoros a. year to his son after him, for
his life: and thus 1' I'vquil-uzl my old man.

I had now to consider which way to steer my course hex>>,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands; and indeed, I had more euro upon my hood
now than l had in my silent. state of life in the island, where
I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what
I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and
my business was how in secure it. 1 had not u cave now to
hide my money in. or a plum where it might lie without lock
or key, till it grow mould y and tarnished before anybody would
meddle with it: on the contrary, I' knew not where to put it,
or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge 1 had. In the
next place, my interest in the limzils seemed to summon
me thither; but new I could not (ell how to think of going
thither till I had settled my oil'airs. and left my oil'oots in
some safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old
friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would he just
to me ; but then she was in years. and but poor,:1nd. for ought
I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word. I had no way
but to go back to England myself, and take my effects
with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this ;
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and
to his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I
began to think of the poor widow, whose husband had been
my first benefactor. and she, while it was in her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I
got u. merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and
carry her, in money, it hundred pounds from me, and to talk
with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she
should, if I lived, have a further supply: at the same time, I
sent my two sisters in the country a. hundred pounds each,
they being, though not in want, yet not in very good circum'
stances; one having been married and left a widow; and the
other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be.
But, among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go Mary to the Brazils, and leave things safe
'behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me.
' I had once a mind to have gone to the Brezils, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about re-
igion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was not
religion that kept me from going there for the present; and
as 1 had made no scru le of being 0 nly of the religion of the
country all the while was among t em, so neither did I yet ;
only that, now and then, having of late thought more of it
than formerly. when I began to think of living and dying
among them, I began to regret my having professed myself
a Papist, and thought it might not he the best religion to
die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brezils, but that really I did not know
with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I resolved at
last to go to England, where, if I arrived, I concluded that I
should make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that
would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go
to England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the

huzil [loot being just going away) resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence; and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a
letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undis-
posnd of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery. and three hundred and sevent -two to the poor, as
the prior should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers for
me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two
trusties, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice
and honesty called for: as for sending them any present,
they were far above having any occasion of it. Lastly, I
wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the
improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works; giving him instructions for his future
government of my part. according to the powers I had left
with my old patron, to whom .I desired him to send whatever
immune due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-
larl y ; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come
to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.
To this i added a very handsome present of some Italian silks
for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's son
informed me he had; with two pieces of fine English broad
cloth, the best I. could get in Lisbon. live pieces of black baize,
and some Flanders loco of a good value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my Gorge, and turned
all my ell'ects into good bills of exchange, my next dilliculty
was which way to go to England: I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet 1 had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time: and though I could give no
reason for it, yet the dillioulty increased upon me so much,
that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go,
yet i altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.

It is true l had been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of tho reasons; but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment: two
of tho ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more
particularly singled out than any other, having put my things
on heard one of them, and in tho other having agreed with
the mptuin; I any two of these ships miscarried; viz. one
was taken by tho Algerinos. and the other was cast away on
the Start, near 'l'orbay. and all the people drowned, except
three; so that in either of these vessels I had been made
miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom ] communimtml everything, pressed me earnestly.
not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the (lroyno, and'
cross over the Bay of Many to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way
by land thrimgh France. In a word. I was so prepossessed
against my going by sea at all, except from (.'alais to Dover,
that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much
the plmsanier way: and to make it more so, my old captain
brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in
Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we
picked up two more English merchants also, and two oung
Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so t t in
all, there were six of us, and five servants; the two merchants
and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with one ser-
vant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got
an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my
man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of
supplying the place of a servant on the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop.
whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well
because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants,
and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so
I shall trouble you new with none of my land journal; but
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of
Spain, and what was worth observing; but, it being the latter
part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from
Madrid about the middle of October; but when we came to
the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on
the way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains, that several travellers were
obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted at
an extreme hazard to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to
countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold
wasinsufierable: nor, indeed, was it more painful than sur-
prising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and imme-
diately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very
keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the moun-
tains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he
had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the matter,
when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so
much violence and so long, that the people said winter was
come before its time; and the roads, which were ditlicult
before, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow
lay in some places too thick for us to' travel, and being not
hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was
no going without being in danger of being buried alive every
step. "'0 stayed no loss than twenty days at Pampeluna:
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of it::
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in the memory of man), I proposed that
we should go away to Fontarabia. and there take shipping for
Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was
considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who,
having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we
were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing
the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them
over the mountains by such ways that they were not much
incominoded with the snow; for where they met with snow
in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to hear
them and their horses. \Ve sent for this guide, who told us
he would undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect
ourselves from wild beasts ; for, he said, in these great snows,
it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the
foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food,
the ground being covered with snow. "is told him we were
well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if he
would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which,
we were told, we were in most danger from, especially on the
French side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there
was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go;
so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish,
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come
back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampcluna with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised,
when, instmd of going forward, he came directly back with
us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty
miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a. warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen;
but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the moun-
tains another way; and though it is true the hills and pre-
cipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such
meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly
pissed the height of the mountains without being much
encumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden, he showed
us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and
Gescony, all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a great
distance, and we had some rough wey to pass stilL

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night so fast that we could hot travel;
but he bid as be easy; we should soon be past it all: we
found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to
come more north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a beer, from shallow way
adjoining to a thick wood: two- of the wolves made at the
guide, and, had he been far before us, he would have been
devoured before we could havevhelped hllfif-l ne of them
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked 'eman with
such violence, that he had not' time or presence of mind
enough to drew his pistol, but hallooad and cried out to us
most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I hide him ride
up, and see what was the matter.- ,.As soon as Friday came
in sight of the man, he halloced out as loud as the other,
" 0 master! 0 master! " but like a bold fellow, rode directly
up to the poor man, and with his pistol ' shot the wolfin the
head that attacked him. ' -

It was happy for the poor man that it was my men Friday;
for, having been used to such creatures in his country, he had
no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him;
whereas, any other of us would have fired at a. further distance,
and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I;
and, indeed, it alarmed all'our company, when, with the'noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the'most dismal
howling of wolves; and the noise redoubled by the echo of
the mountains, appeared to us as if them had been aprodigious
number of them: and perhaps there was not such 5 few as304 mm Am) Ammonia

that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday
had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the
horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing him any
damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the
bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was
most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in\

the arm, and the other time a. little above his knee; and
though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling
down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and
shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which
was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded
us before, we saw clearly what had been the ease, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner as that which followed between Friday and,
the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were surprised!
and afraid for him. the greatest diversion imaginable. As the-
hoar is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as th
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular
qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions ; first, as
to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually'
attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be
excessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the
ease, the ground being covered with snow), if you do not
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but then
you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step
out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another way and keep going on; for
sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at
him, he takes it for an afiront; but if you throw or toss any-
thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick
as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all
other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have
satisfaction in point of honour ;--that is his first quality:
the next is, if he be once ail'ronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good
round rate till he overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him, he was helping him oif his horse, for the man was,
both hurt and frightened, when on a sudden we espied thei
bear come out of the wood, and a monstrous one it was, thel,
Ibiggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised
when we saw him ; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to
see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance: " 0, 0, 0 l "
says Friday, three times, pointing to him; "0 master! you
give me to leave, me shakes te hand with him; me makee you
good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased: " You
fool," says I, " he will eat you up."---" Eatee me up! sates

u306 - LIFE no Anvnmunxs

me up! " says Friday, twice over again; " me eateo him up:
me mokoe you good laugh ; you all stay here, me show you
good laugh." So down he sits, and gets ofi his boots in u.
moment, and puts on a. pair of pumps (:13 we coll the flat shoes
they wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other
servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like
the wind.
The beer was walking softly on, end oifered to meddle with
nobody, till I'h'iduy coming pretty near, cells to him, as if the '
"year could undoretund him, " Hui-k ye, hark ye," says Friday,
" mo sponkeo with you." "'0 followed at a distance, for now
being down on tho Gnseony side of the mountains, we were
outerod u vest forest, where the country was plain and pretty
open, though it had muny tmes in it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, us we say, the heels of the bear. came up
with him quickly, and took up u grout stone, and throw it at
him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm
than if he had thrown it against a. well; but it answered
Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it
purely to umke the boar follow him, and show us some laugh,
as he called it. As soon as the beer folt the blow, and saw
him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking very long
strides. and shuflliug on at a strange rote, so as would have
put :1 horse to a middling gallop: away runs Friday, and
takes his course as if he ran towards us for help; so we all
resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man ;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the hear
back upon us, when he was going about his own business
another way ; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us. and then ran away; and I called out, " You
eogl is this your mnking us laugh? Come away, and take.
yotu' horse, that we may shoot the creature." He heard me, i
and cried out, "No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get.
much laugh :" and as tho nimble creature ran two feet for
tho hour's one, he turned on a, sudden on one side of us, and
seeing a great oak-tree lit for his purpose, he beckoned to us
to follow; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree,
laying his gun down upon the ground. at about five or six
yards from tho hot-tom of the tree. The hour soon came to
the tree, and we followed at a distance : tho first thing ho. did.
he stopped at the gun. smelled at it. but lot it. lie. and up he
srimuhlos into tho tree. climbing like a out, though so men.
atrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it,
of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh
at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near:
to him. '
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to tlm
small end of a large branch, and the bear got about half way
to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the
limb of the tree was weaker,---" Hal " says he to us, " now
you see me teaches the bear dance: " so he begun jumping and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he
should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But
Friday had not done with him by a great deal ; when seeing
him. stand still, he called'out to him again, as if ho had
supposed the bear could speak English, " What, you come no
farther? pray you come farther; " so he left jumping and
shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what
he said, did come a. little farther ; then he began jumping
again, and the bear stopped again. We thought now was a
good time to knock him in the head, and called to Friday to
stand still, and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out
earnestly, "O pray! 0 play! no shoot, me sheet by and
then : " he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the boar stood so
ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he
depended upon shaking the bear oil ; and wo found the hear
was too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great
broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and what the jest would be as. last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly : for seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to
come any farther, " Well, well," says Friday, "you no come
farther, me go ; you no come to me, me come to you ; " and
upon this he went out to the smaller end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently let himself down
by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to
jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it
up, and stood still. "Well," said I to him, "Friday, what
will you do now! Why don't you shoot him 2 "---" N o shoot,"
says Friday, "no yet 3 me shoot now, me no kill; gm stay,
0308 mu: AND Amen-mums

give you one more laugh : " and, indeed, so he did ; for when
the boar saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough
whore he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind
him every step, and coming backward till he got into the
body of tho tree; thou, with the same hinder end foremost,
ho vuulo down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one foot at a time, wry leisurely. At this juncture, and just!
before ho could not his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped
up (-losu to him, clapped tho nmmlo of his piece into his ear,
and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we
did not laugh; and when he saw wo wuro pleased, by our
looks, ho hogan to laugh very loud. "So we kill bear in
my country," says Friday. "So you kill them?" says 1;
"why. you luwo no guns."--"4M>," says ho. " no gun, but
shoul- great much long arrow." This was a good diversion to
us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very
nun-h hurt, and what to do wo hardly know ; tho howling of
wolves mu much in my hood ; and, indeed, except the noise I
once hoard on tho shon- ol' ;\ fri -a. of which I have said some-
thing already, 1 never hoard anything that lillod me with so
much horror.

Those things, and the approach of night. called us off, or
else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have
taken the skin of this monstrous creature oil, which was worth
wring; but we had near throo leagues to go, and our guide
hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey.

Tho ground was still covered with snOW, though not so
deep and dangerous. as on the mountains; and the ravenous
creatures, mu \'m hoard aftorwards, were come down into the
forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food.
and had done a great. deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country people, killed a. great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too. We had one
dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us, if there were i
more wolves in the country we should find them there; and
this was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side,
and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to
got through the wood, and then we should come to the village
where we were to lodge. It was within half :m hour of sunset
when we entered the wood, and a. little after sunset when we
uuue into the plain : we met with nothing in the first wood,
except that in a little plain within the wood, Which was not
above two furlongs over, we saw five grout wolves cross the
read, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice
of us, and were gone out of sight in n few moments. Upon
this, our guide, who by the way was but a. fuint-honrted
follow, bid us keep in a. ready posture, for he believed there
were more wolves n-coming. We kept our arms ready, and
our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came
through that wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain. As soon as we come into the plain, we lmd occasion
enough to look about us: the first object we met wi was a
dead horse; tint is to say, a. poor horse which the wolves had
killed, and at least 0. dozen of them at work, we could not say
eating him, but picking his bones rather ; for they had enter

up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them
at their feast, neither did they take much notice of 118.
Friday would have let fly at thorn, but I would not suffer him
by any means ; for I found we were like to have more business
upon our hands than we were swore of. We had not gone
half over the plain, when we began to hear the wolves bowl
in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently
after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us,
all in a. body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an
army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in
what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in
n. close line was the only way; so we formed in a moment;
but that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that
only every other men - should fire, and that the others, who
had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley
immediately, if they continued to advance upon us ; and then
that those who had fired at first, should not pretend to load'
their fusees again, but stand ready, every one with a pistol,'
for we were all armed with a fuses and a. pair of pistols each
man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys,
half of us at a time: however, at present we had no necessity;
for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop,
being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire. Four
of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others were
wounded, and went bleeding of, as we could see by the
snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately re-
treat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the
lien-est <<motor-es were terrified at the voice of a men, I caused
all the company to lmlloo as loud as they could ; and I found
the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they
begun to retire and turn about. J then ordered a. second
Volley to be tired in their rear, whieh put them to the gallop,
and away they Went. to the woods. This gave us leisure to
charge our pieces again ; and that we might lose no time, wax
kept. going; but. we haul but little more than loaded our.
inset-s. and 1nd. ourselves in r unlinexs. when we heard a.
terrible noise in the some wood on our left. only that it was
further onward. the smno way we were to go.

The night. was coming on. and the light begun to ho dusky,
whit-h nunle it. worse on our aide; but. the noise increasing,
we eonld extsily perceive that- it. was the howlingnnd yelling of
those hellish er "dun-es; and, on a. sudden. we purmived three
troops of Wolves, one on our left, one. behind us, and one in
our front. so that we seemed to be surrounded with them:
however, as they did not. fell upon us, we kept our way
l'oru-.~n~d, us last. as we could make our horses go, which, the
way lN-illg very rough. was only :1. good hard trot. ]n this
manner, we ozone in Vluw of the entrance of a. wood, through

we were greatly surprised. when coming nearer the hunt) or
Puss. we so." a, confused number of wolves standing just at tho
eutrnnee. ()n a. sudden. at. another opening of the wood. wo

.mrso had the advantage. of them ; but as we supposed that he
could not, hold it. :u that rate. we doubted not but they would
get. up with him at. last : no question but they did.

But. here we had u most horrible sight; for, riding up to
the entrain-e where the horse come out, we found the extremes
of another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous
rrenlnres ; and one of the men was no doubt the some whom
We heard tire the gun. for there lay a. gun just by him fired

body were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we
knew not what. course to take; but the creatures resolved us

lmppnzed. \'I'I'V much to our advantage, that at the entrance
into the wood, but a. little way from it, there lay some large
timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before,
end I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little tl'Or-p
in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a linobohh d
one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that
tree before us for a. breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three
fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. We did so, and it
was well we did; for never was a. more furious charge than
the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with
a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of tiniimi',

 

A "0333 PUHUBD BY WOLVH.

which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only}
rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was
' rincipally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us.
ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and
they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a
continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind
pushing on those before.

When we had fired a. second volley of our fusees, we thought
they stopped a. little, and I hoped they would have gone off,
but it was but a. moment, for others came forward again;
so we fired two volleys of our pistols ; and I [allow in these
four firings we hm] killed seventeen or eighteen at them, and
humid twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath
to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my
man Friday, for he was hottermnployed, for, with the greatest
dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fume and his own
while we were ongngud,--hut, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all
along the piece of timber, and let it he a largo train. He did
so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came
up to it, and some get upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged
pistol close to the powder. set it on fire ; times that were upon
the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
fell, or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright
of the fire: we despat-tehed those in on instant. and the rest
were so frightened with the light, which the night-- for it was
now very near dark--- made more terrible, that they drew back
a little; upon which I ordered our last pistols to he fired off in _
one volley, and after that we gave a shout; upon this the
wolves turned tail. and we sallied immediately upon near
twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and
fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our
expectation, for the crying and howling they made was better
understood by their follows; so that they all fled and
10 t as.

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them,
and had it been daylight we had killed many more. The
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again,
for we had still near a league to go. "We heard the ravenous
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times,
and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about an
hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms; for, it
seems. the night before, the wolves and some hours had broke
into the village, and put them in such terror, that they were
obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the
night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs
swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he
could go no farther; so we were obliged to take a. new guide
here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, 3
fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor any-
thing like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse,
they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when the
snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much what kind
of guide we had got, who would venture to bring us that way
in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising we were
not all devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves
and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and
told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it
was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious,
seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really
afraid of a gum--but being excessively hungry, and raging on
that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had made
them senseless of danger,---aud that if we had not by the
continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of
powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we
had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would
not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men
were on their backs, as otherwise; and, withal, they told us
that at last, if we had stood all together, and left our horses,
they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we
might have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our
hands, being so many in number. For my part, I was never
so sensible of danger in my life,---for, seeing above three
hundred devils come rearing and open-mouthed to devour us,
and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself
over for lost ; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to
cross those mountains again; I think I would much rather go
a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a
storm once a Week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France,--nothing but what other travellers have
given an account of with much more advantage than I can.
I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any con-
siderable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th
of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a
little time all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the
bills of exchange which I brought with me having been very

currently paid.31-1 "(FE AND mvus'ruuss

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent
her, thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ
for inc; and l trusted her so entirely with everything, that
.l was perfectly easy as to the security of my oll'octs ; and,
indeed, l was very happy from the beginning, and now to the
end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gontlowoman.

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in
the llmzils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who having

'oll'ored it to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees,
who lived in tho Bmzils. they accepted the olTer, and remittml
thirtyvthreo thousand pier-es of eight to a corrospomlont of
theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent
me the hills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred
pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the payment of one
hundred moidores a year to him (tho old man) during his life,
and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I
had promised them, and which the plantation was to make
good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part
of a life of fortune and adventure, at life of Providence's
choquor-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom
be able to show the like of ;--boginning foolishly, but closing
much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so
much as to hope for.

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good
fortune, 1 was past running any more hazards--and so,
indeed, I had been, if other circumstances had concurred;
but ] was inumd to a wandering life, had no family, nor
many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted fresh
acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils,
yet I could not keep that country out of my head, and had a\
great mind to be upon the wing again; especially I could not
resist the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to
know if the poor Spaniards were in being there. My true
friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so
far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she pre-
vented my running abroad, during which time I took my two
nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care;
the eldest, having something of his own, I bred up as a
gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to
his estate after my decease. The other I placed with the
captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a sensible,
bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,
and sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew
me in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself.

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or
dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one
daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home
with good success from a voyage toSpain, my inclination to go
abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was in
the year 1694.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island,---saw
my successors the Spaniards,--had the old story of their lives,
and of the villains I left there,--how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards,-----how they afterwards agreed, disagreed,
united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them--how they were subjected to the
Spaniards,--how honestly the Spaniards used them ; a history,
if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful acci-
dents as my own part,--particularly, also, as to their battles
with the Caribbeaus, who landed several times upon the
island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island
itself,--and how five of them made an attempt upon the
mainland, and brought away eleven men and five women
prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty
young children on the island.

Here I stayed about twenty days,--left them supplies of
all necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot,
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I had brought from
England with me,-viz. a. carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them,
reserved to myself the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled
all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the
place, I left them there. I

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a
bark, which I bought there, with more people to the island;
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being
such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised to send316 um um ADVENTURES or nonmsox causes.

them some women from England, with a. good cargo of neces-
saries, if they would apply themselves to plenting,---which
I afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very
honest and diligent after they were mastered, and had their
properties not apart for them. I sent them, also, from the
"nails, live cows, three of them being big with calf, some
sheep. and some hogs, which when I came again were con-
siderably increased.

But all these things, with an account how three hundred
Caribbean came and invaded them, and ruined their planta-
tions, and how they fought with that whole number twice,
and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but, at
last. a storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they femished
or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered
the FOSSOSSiOn of their plantation, and still lived upon the
island.

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall
give a fut-lim- account of in the Smond Part of my Story.
THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions in
England, viz. "That what is bred in the bone will not go
out of the flesh," was never more verified than in the story
of my Life. Any one would think that after thirty-five
years' ullliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances,
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and after
near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of
all things ; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed
me to have had experience of every state of middle life, and
to know which was most adapted to make a. man completely
happy ; I say, after all this, any one would have thought
that the native propensity to rambling, which I gave an
account of in my first setting out in the world to have been
so predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, and I
might, at sixty--one years of age, have been a little inclined to
stay at hcme, and have done venturing life and fortune any

more.
No , further, the common motive of foreign adventures

was taken away in me, for I had no fortune to make; I had
not-hing to seek: if I had gained ten thousand pounds, I had
been no richer; for I had already sufficient for me, and for
those I had to leave it to; and what I had was visibly
increasing; for, having no great family, I could not spend
the income of what I had, unless I would set up for an
expensive way of living, such as a. great family, servants,
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no
notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing, indeed, to
do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it
increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no
elfect upon me, or at least not enough to resist the strong
inclination 1 had to go abroad again, which hung about me
like a chronical distemper. In particular, the desire of seein
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left there,
ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and
my imagination ran upon it all day: it was uppermost in all

' my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly
upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing
could remove it out of my mind: it even broke so violently
into all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome,
for I could talk of nothing else ; all my discourse ran into it,
even to impertinenee ; and I saw it myself.

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all
the stir that people make in the world about ghosts and
apparitions is owing to the strength of imagination, and the
laurel-fol operation of fancy in their minds; that there is no
such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking; that
people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of
their deceased friends, so realizes it to them, that they are
ealmble of faneying, upon some extraordinary circumstances,
that they see them, talk to them, and are answered by them,
when. in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the
thing. and they really know nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, speetres, or walking of people
after they are dead; or whether there is anything in the
stories they tell us of that kind more than the product of
vapours. sick minds, and wandering fancies : but this I know,
that my imagination worked up to such a height, and brought
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it,
that I actually Sllp'xlsed myself often upon the spot, at my old
east lo. behind the trees ; saw my old Siutniard. Friday's father.
and the roprohate sailors 1 left upon the island ; nay, I fancied
i talked with them, and looked at them steadily, though I was
broad awake, as at persons just before me,- and this I did till
1 often frightened myself with the images my fancy repre-
sented to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the villany of the
three pirate sailors so livel y related to me by the first Spaniard
and Friday's father, that it was surprising : they told me how
they barbarously attem ted to murder all the Spaniards, and
that they set fire to t e provisions they had laid up, on
urpoee to distress and starve them; things that I had never
eard of, and that, indeed, were never all of them true in
fact : but it was so warm in my imagination, and so realized
to me, that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded
but that it was or would be true : also how I resented it, when
the Spaniard complained to me; and how I brought them to
justice, tried them, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
What there was really in this shall be seen in its place: for
however I came to form such things in my dream, and what
secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say,
much of it true. I own that this dream had nothing in it
literally and specifically true; but the general part was so
true,--the base, villanous behaviour of these three hardened
rogues was such, and had been so much worse than all I can
describe, that the dream had too much similitude of the fact;
and as I would afterwards have punished them severely, so, if
I had hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and even
should have been justified both by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my story : In this kind of temper I lived
some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no plemant hours,
no agreeable diversion, but what had something or other of
this in it ; so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she believed
there was some secret, powerful impulse of Providence upon
me, which had determined me to go thither again; and that
she found nothing hindered my going, but my being engaged
to a wife and children. She told me that it was true she
could not think of parting with me: but as she was assured
that if she was dead it would be the first thing I would do;
so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above,
she would not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit
and resolved to go [Here she found me very intent upon
her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it
a little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why she
did not go on, and say out what she was going to say? But I
rceived that her heart was too full, and some tears stood in
or eyes.] " Speak out, my dear," said I ; "are you willing
I should go? "---" No," says she, very afiectionately, "I am

and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland
country, I was removed from conversing among sailors and
things relating to the remote parts of the world. I went
down to my farm, settled my family, bought ploughs, barrows,
a cart, Waggon'horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously
to work, became in one half-year a mere country gentleman.
My thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants,
cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, (he; and I lived,
as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was capable
of directing,or that a man always bred to misfortunes was
capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was
limited by no articles; I could pull up or out down as I
pleased ; what I planted was for myself, and what I improved
was for my family ; and having thus left off the thoughts of
wandering, I had not the lemt discomfort in any part of life
as to this world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my father so earnestly recommended
to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something like what
is described by the poet, upon the subject of a country life :----

" Free from vices, free from care,
' Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen
Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach
upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its conse-
quences, into a deep relapse of the wandering disposition,
which, as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon
recovered its hold of me; and, like the returns of a violent
distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon me. This
blow was the loss of my wife. It is not my business here to
write an elegy upon my wife, give a character of her particular!
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a.
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my
afiairs ; the centre of all my enterprises; the engine that, byl
her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I was in,
from the most extravagant and ruinous project that filled my
head, and did more to guide my rambling genius than a
mother's fears, a father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or
all my own reasoning powers could do. I was happy in
listening to her, and in being moved by her entrestissz and

and in a fow montha uftor 1 did so.

\Vhon l 011qu to London. I was still as unoasy as l was
before; I had no relish for the place. no employment in it,
nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person, of
whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in God's creation,
and it is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his kind
whether he be dead or alive. This also was the thing which,
of all circumstances of life, was the most my aversion, who had
been all my days used to an active life ; and I would often say
to myself, " A state of idleness is the very dregs of life ;" and,
indeed, I thought I was much more suitably employed when 1
was twenty-six do s making a deal board. '
It was now t 0 beginning of the year 1693, when my
nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had brought up
to the sea, and had made him commander of a ship, was come
home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had
made. He came to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for
them to the East Indies, and to China, as private traders.
" And now, uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea with me, I

will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island;
for we are to touch at the Brazils."

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state,
and of the existence of an invisible world, than the concur-
rence of second causes with the idea of things which we form
in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any
in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how for my distemper of wander-
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had
in his thought to say, when that very morning, before he came
to me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and
revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to
this resolution, that I would go to Lisbon, and consult with
my old sea-captain; and if it was rational and practicable, I
would go and see the island again, and what was become of my
people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of
peopling the place, and mrrying inhabitants from hence,
getting a patent for the possession, and I know not what;
when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as 1
have said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way
to the East Indies.

I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him,
" What devil," said I, "sent you on this unlucky errand! "_
My nephew stared as if he had been frightened of. first ; but
perceiving that I was not much displeased at the proposal, he
recovered himself. "I hope it may not be an unlucky pro-
posal, sir," says he, " I dare say you would be pleased to see

 

ORE-802's NEPHRW 03m N TAKE ll"! 1'0 THE ISLAND>

your new colony there, where you once reigned with male
felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world." In
a. word, the acheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to
my, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said
so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would with him ; but I told him I would
not promise to go any urther than my own island. " Why,
sir," says he, " you don't want to be left there again, I hope?"
." But," said I, " can you not take me up again on your
return!" He told me it would not be possible to do so;
that the merchants would never allow him to come that way
with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of.
his way, and mi ht be three or four. " Besides, sir, if I should
miscarry," said 9, " and not return at all, then you would be
just reduced to the condition you were in before."

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy
for it; which was, to carry a framed sloop on board the ship,
which being taken in pieces, might. by the help of some
carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again
in the island, and finished fit to go to sea in a few days. I
was not long resolving; for, indeed, the importunities of my
nephew joined so effectually with my inclination, that nothing
could oppose me; on the other hand, my wife being dead,
none concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade me
one way or the other, except my ancient good friend the
widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years,
my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a long
voyage; and above all, my young children. But it was all to
no purpose: I had an irresistible desire for the voyage; and I
told her I thought there was something so uncommon in the
impressions I had upon my mind, that it would be a kind of
resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at home;
after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me,
not only in making Envision for my voyage, but also in
settling my family ' for my absence, and providing for

'lthe education of my children. In order to do this, I made,
my will, and settled the estate I had in such a manner for my?
children, and placed in such hands, that I was perfectly my.
and satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever
might befall mo ; and for their education, I left it wholly to
the widow, with a sufiicient maintenance to herself for her
care : all which she richly deserved; for no mother could have
taken more care in their education, or understood it better:
and as she lived till I came home, Ialso lived to thankher
for it.830 LII-'1': AND Anvrzmnns

My nephew was rowdy to sail about the beginning of
January, 1694-5; and 1, with my man Friday, went on
board, in the Downs, the 8th ; having, besides that sloop
which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of all
kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which, if I did not
find in good condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants whom I purposed in
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there
upon my account, while I stayed, and either to leave then

itliore or carry them forward, as they should a pear willing:
particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a. very
handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was
also a general mechanic; for he was doxterous at making
wheels, and hand~mills to grind corn, was a. good tumor, and
a good pot-maker; he also made anything that was proper to
make of earth or of wood: in a word, we called him our
szk-of-all-trndes. With these I carried a. tailor, who had
offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new plante-
tion, and who proved a most necessary handy follow as could
be desired, in many other businesses besides that of his
trade; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all
employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards
that I expected to find there; and enough of them, as by my
calculation, might comfortably supply them for seven years:
if I remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household stufl',i
particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass,
&-c.; and near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails,'
tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary
thing I could think of.

1 carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees;
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all
sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass
cannon; and, because I knew not what time and what ex-
tremities l was providing for, I carried a. hundred barrels of
powder, besides swords, outlasses, and the iron part of some
pikes and halberts. In short, we had a large magazine of all
sorts of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave
behind if there was occasion; so that when we came there, we
might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies.
Indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough for all,
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the
island; as shall be seen in the course of that story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used
to meet with; and, therefore, shall have the less occasion to 'in-

terrupt the reader, who, perhaps, my be impatient to hear how
matters went with my colony: yet some odd accidents, cross

winds, and bad weather, happened on this first setting out,
which made the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and
I, who had never made but one voyage, my first voyage to
Guinea, in which I might be said to come back again, as the
voyage was at first designed, began to think the same ill fate
attended me; and that I was born to be never contented with
being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two-and~twenty days : but we had this satisfaction
with the disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap,
and in the utmost plenty; so that while we lay here, we never
touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them. Here,
also, I took in several live hogs, and two cows with their
calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on
slfiorle1 in my island ; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise
0 t em.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a
very fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it
might be about the 20th of February in the evening late,
when the mate, having the watch, came into the round-house,/
and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and
while he was telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the
boatswain heard another. This made us all run out upon the
quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing ; but in a
few minutes we saw a very great light, and found that there
was some very terrible fire at a distance; immediately we had
recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that there

' l
could be no land that way in which the fire showed itself, no,
not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W.N. W. Upon
this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as,
by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that
it could not be for off, we stood directly towards it, and were
pwsently satisfied we should discover it, because the further
we sailed, the greater the light appeared ; though the weather
being hazy, we could not perceive anything but the light. for
a while. In about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair
for us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a
little, we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on lire
in the middle of the sea.

1 was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not
at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it : I presently
recoflectcd my former circumstances, and what condition I was
in when taken up by the Portuguese captain ; and how much
more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures
belonging to that ship must be, if they had no other ship in
company with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another, that, if
possible. we might give notice to them that there was help for
them at hand. and that they might endeavour to save them-
selves in their boat ; for though we could see the flames of the
ship. yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our
great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew
up in the air; and in a few minutes all the fire was out, that
is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This was a terrible, and
indeed an alliicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who,
I concluded. must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be
in the utmost distress in their boat, in the middle of the
ocean ; which. at present, as it was dark, I could not see.
However, to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to
be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and
which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long;f letting them know by this that there was a ship not
far 0 .

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there
were two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in
the water. We perceived they rowed, the wind being against
them; that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make
us see them. We immediately spread our ancient, to let them
know we saw them, and hung a wait out, as a signal for them
to come on board, and then made more sail, standing directly
to them. In little more than half an hour, we came up with
.them; and took them all in, being no less than sixty-four
men, women, and children; for there were a great many
passengers.

Upon inquiry, we found it was a French merchant ship of
three hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec. The master
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship; how the
fire began in the steersge, by the negligence of the steersmsn;
which, on his crying out for help, was, as everybody thought,
entirely put out; but they soon found that some sparks of the
first fire had got into some part of the ship so difficult to come
at that they could not effectually quench it; and afterwards
getting in between the timbers, and within the ceiling of the
ship, it proceeded into the hold, and mastered all the skill and
all the application they were able to exert.

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their
long-bout, and a great shallop, besides a. small skiE, which was
of no great service to them, other than toget some fresh water
and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives
from the fire. They had, indeed, small hopes of their lives by
getting into these boats at that distance from any land ; only,
as they said, that they thus escaped from the fire, and there
was a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea
and might take them in. They had sails, cars, and a compass;
and had as much provision and water as, with sparing it so as'
to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve

,days, in which, if they had no bed weather and no contrary

iwinds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks
of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain
them till they might go on shore. But there were so many
chances against them in all these cases, such as storms, to
overset and founder them; rains and cold, to bennmb and
perish their limbs ; contrary winds, to keep them out and
starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous if
they had escaped-
In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told
me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a
gun fire, and after that four more: these were the five guns
which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This revived
their hearts, and gave them the notice, Which, as above, I
desired it should, that there was a ship at hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing of these guns that they took down
their masts and sails: the sound coming from the windward,
they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after this,
hearing no more guns, they fired three muskets, one a con-
siderable while after another; but these, the wind being
contrary, we never heard. Some time after that again, they
were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights,
and hearing the guns which, as I have said, I caused to be
tired all the rest of the night. This set them to work with
their oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we might
the sooner come up with them ; and, at last, to their inexpres-
sible joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor
delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls at
so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily
described: sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of
the head and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a. thousand oxtravagances
in it. There were some in tears; some raging and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies oi
sorrow ; some stark raving and downright lunatic; some ran
about the ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their
hands ; some were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more
crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others;
sick and vomiting ; several swooning and ready to faint; andl~
a few were crossing themselves and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them either; there might be many that
were thankful afterwards ; but the passion was too strong for
them at first, and they were not able to master it: they were
thrown into ecstacies, and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a
very few that were composed and serious in their joy. Per-
haps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the
particular circumstance of that nation they belongcd to: Im CR" 15 um '30! m BURNING SHIP.,~--.. pann-- w uh --

mean the French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile,
more passionate, and more 8 rightly, and their spirits more

fluid than in other nations. am not ficsopher enough to-

determine the cause; but nothing I ever seen before
came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage,
was in, when he found his father in the boat, came the nearest
to it; and the surprise of the master and his two companions,
whom I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in
the island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was to

compare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else

in my life.

It is further observable, that these extravagancesdid not
show themselves in that diflerent manner I have mentioned,
in difierent persons only; but all the variety would appear, in
a short succession of moments, in one and the same person.
A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid
and confounded, would the next minute be dancing and
hallooing like an antic ; and the next moment he tearing his
hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under
his feet like a madman; in a few moments after that we would
'have him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not im-
mediate help been had, he would in a few moments have been
dead. Thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty,
but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember right,
our surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty persons.

There were two priests among them: one an old man, and
the other a young man; and that which was strangest was,
the oldest man was the worst. As soon as he set his foot on
board our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone
dead to all appearance. Not the least sign of life could be
perceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper
remedies to recover him, and was the only man in the ship
that believed he was not dead. At length he opened a vein
in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to
warm it as much as possible. Upon this, the blood, which
only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the
manopened hiseyes ; a quarter of an hour after that he spoke
grew better, and after the blood was stopped, he walked
about, told us he was perfectly well, and took a dram of
cordial which the surgeon gave him. About a quarter of an
hour after this, they came running into the cabin to the

surgeon, Who was bleeding 2: Frenchwoman that had fainted,
land told him the priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had
begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind,
.and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy. His spirits
whirled aboutfeatcr than the vessels could convey them, the
blood grow hot and feverish ; and the man was as fit lor Bedlam
any creature that ever was in it. The surgeon would not
bleed him again in that condition, but gave him something to
doze and put him to sleep; which, after some time, operated
upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed and
Well. The younger priest behaved with great command of his
passions. and was really an exampleof a serious, well-governed
mind. At his first coming on board the ship he threw him--
self flat on his face, prostrating himself in thankfulncss for his
deliverance, in which I unhappily and unseasmmbly disturbed
him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke
calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his
deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, and that,
next to his Maker, he \vould give me thanks also. I was
heartily sorry that l disturbed him, and not only left him,
but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued
in that posture about thrre minutes, or little more, after I left
him. then came to me. as ho had said he would, and, with a
great deal of seriousness and al'l'mtt-ien. but with tears in his
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him and so
many miserable creatures their lives. I told him I had no
need to tell him to thank God for it, rather than me, for I had
seen that he had done that already ; but I added that it was
nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men,
and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, .
who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of
'his mercy to so many of his creatures. After this, the young
priest applied himself to his countrymen, and laboured to
'compese them : he lK'J'Sluuled, entreated, argued, reasoned with
them, and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of
their reason; and with some he had success, though others
were for a time out of all government of themselves. -
1 cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding
themselves in the extravagances of their passions; for if an
mouse of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extravaganws of
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to'l And, indeed,
here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our
passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction,
as those of sorrow and anger.

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances
among our new guests, for the first day; but after they had
.retired to lodging- provided for them as well as our ship
would allow, and had slept heartily--as most of them did,
being fatigued and frightened--they were quite another sort
of people the next day. Nothing of good manners, or civil
acknowledgments for the kindness shown them, was wanting ;
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough to exceed
that way. The captain and one of the priests came to me
the next day, and desired to speak with me and my nephew;
the commander began to consult with us what should he
done with them; and, first, they told us we had saved their
lives, so all they had was little enough for a return to us for
that kindness received. The captain said they had saved
some money and some things of value in their boats, caught
hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it, they
were ordered to make an offer of it all to us ; they only
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if
possible, they might get- a passage to France. My nephew
wished to accept their money at first word, and to consider
what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled him in
that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a
strange country; and if the Portuguese captain that took me
up at sea had served me so, and taken all I had for my
deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as much a slave
at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the mere being sold
'to a Mahometan excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not
a much better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases,
much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to
do so, as we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be
so delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity;
that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they
would have done for us, if we had been in their case, and
they in ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to

22
plunder them; and it would be a most barbarous thing to
take that little from them which they had saved out of the
tire, and then set them on shore and leave them; that this
would he first to save them from death, and then kill them
ourselves: save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and. therefore, I would not let the least thing be
[taken from them. As to setting them on shore, I told them;
.indood, that was an exceeding dilliculty to us, for that the
ship was bound to the East Indies; and though we were
driven out of our course to the westward a very great way,
and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their
deliveranee. yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change
our voyage on their particular account; nor could my nephew,
the captain, answer it to the freighteru, with whom he was
under charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil ; and all
I know we could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way
of meeting with other ships homoward bound from the "fleet
Indies, :..nd get them a passage, if possible, to England or
l"l':ul('-('..

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it ; but they were in
very great consternation, especially the passengers, at the
notion of being carried away to the East Indies ; they then
entreated me, that as I was driven so far to the westward
before 1 met with them. I would, at least, keep on the same
course to the Banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable
I might meet with some ship or sleep that they might hire to
awry them back to Canada.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part,
and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for, indeed, I con-
sidered that to carry this whole company to the East Indies
would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor
people, but would he ruining our whole voyage, by devouring
all our provisions ; so i thought it no breach of eharter-party,
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to
us, and in whieh no one could say we were to blame; for the
laws of God and nature would have forbid that we should
refuse to take. up two boats full of people in such a distressed
rendition; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting
ourselves as the poor people. obliged us to set them on shore
somewhere or other for their deliverance. So 1 consented,
that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and
weather would permit; and if not, that I would carry them
to Martinioo, in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty
good ; and as the winds had continued in the points between
N.E. and 8.13. a long time, we missed several opportunities of
sending them to France; for we met several ships bound to'
Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's,
but they had been so long beating up against the wind that
they durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting pro-
visions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they
should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about
a week after this that we made the Banks of Newfoundland ;
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on
board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on
shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could
get provisions to victusl themselves with. When I say all
the French went on shore, I should it nember, that the young
priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies,
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on
the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as will
appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered them-
selves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies,
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together,
sometimes little or no wind at all; when we met with another
subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable
as that before. ,

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on
the 19th day of March, 1694-5, when we spied a sail, our
course SE. and by S. We soon perceived it was a large
vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first know
what to make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we
found she had lost her maintopmast, foremost, and bowsprit;
and presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress. The
weather was pretty good, wind at N.N.W. a fresh gale, and
we soon came to speak with her. We found her a ship of
Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown out
of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to
sail, by a terrible hurricane. while the captain and chief mate312 tum Mn ADVI-

I had pol-Imps not known this part. if my curiosity had not

board the ship. The socoud mato. who upon this mansion
(-ummamlod tho ship. had boon on board our ship, and he toldl
mo. thoy had tin-m- passmlgors in the great cabin. that were in
a (lopluraldu condition: " Nay," says he, " I bolieve they are
dead. for l have hoard nothing of them for above two days:
and I was afraid to inquire after them," said he, " for I had
nothing to reliove thom with." "Fe immediately applied our-
=olvrs to giro them what relief we could spare; and, indood,
] had so far m-orrulud things with my nephew, that I would
have victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia,
or any other part of the coast of America, to have supplied
ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were afraid
of eating too much, even of that little we gave them. The
mate, or commander, brought six men with him in his boat;
but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so
weak that they could hardly sit to their cars. The mate
himself was very ill, and half-starved; for he declared he
had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and share
alike with them in every bit they ate. I cautioned him to eat ,
sparingly, and set meat before him immediately, but he had"
not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out
of order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed him
up something with some broth, which he said would be to him
both food and physio ; and after he had taken it he grew
better. In the meantime I forgot not the men. I ordered
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather de<<
voured than ate it: they were so exceedingly hungry that they
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command of them!
selves; and two of them ate with so much greediness, that
they were in danger of their lives the next morning. The
sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, and
brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first
coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least mouthful
of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly
apprehensions I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miser--
able condition of the shi '3 company, I could not put out
of my thought the story e had tol me of the three poor
creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mother, her son, and the
imaid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three
days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly'
neglected, their own extremities being so great; by which I
undersix ed, that they had really given them no food at all,
and that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.

As 1 therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain,
on board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not
the starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own.
boat to go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve
men, to carry them a sack of breed, and four or five pieces of
beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meet
to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-
room, to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out
)f the pot before it was well boiled, and then to give every
man but a very little at a. time: and by this caution he pre-
served the men, who would otherwise have killed themselves
with that very food that was given them on purpose to save
heir lives.

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in;
and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what
refreshment was proper: and the surgeon gave him a. large
pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he had given
the mute that was on board, and which he did not question
would restore them gradually. I was not satisfied with this:
but, as I said above, having a. great mind to see the scene of
misery which I knew the ship itself would present me with,
in a. more lively manner than I could have it by report, I took
the captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, and
went myself, a. little after, in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a. tumult, to get
the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my
mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-
room door, and the man he placed there, after using all pos-
sible persuasion to have patience, kept them of! by force;
however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot,
and softened with the liquor of the meat, which they called
brewis, and gave them every one some, to stay their stomachs,
and told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged

. to give them but little at a. time. But it was all in vain ; and.
' had I not come on board, and their own commander andi
officers with me, and with good words, and some threats also
of giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into
the cook-room by force, and tom the meat out of the furnace--
for words are indeed of very small force to a. hungry belly 3.
however, we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously at first, and the next time gave them more, and at

last filled their bellies, and the men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the
ship's company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last
totally neglected them: so that for six or seven days it might
be said they had really no food at all, and for several days
before very little. The poor mother, who, as the men reported,
was a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared all she
could so afiectionately for her son, that at last she entirely
sank under it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she set
upon the floor on deck, with her back up against the sides,

between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk.

between her shoulders like a corpse, though not quite do".
My mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and
with a spoon put some broth into her mouth. She opened her
lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not speak: yet she
understood what he said, and made signs to him, intimating
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she
would have said they should take care of him. However,
the mate, who was exceedingly moved at the sight, endeavoured
to get some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got
two or three spoonfuls down--though I question whether he
could be sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she died
the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in
a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in
him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having
eaten up the rest of it; however, being young, and having
more strength than his mother, the mate got something down
his throat, and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving

him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary,

he was very sick, and brought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid : she lay all along upon
the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had

fallen down in a fit of apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her '

limbs were distorted; one of her hands was clasped round the
'frame of the chair, and she gripped it so hard that we could
not easily make her let it go; her other arm lay over her
head, and her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame
of the cabin table: in short, she lay just like one in the
agonies of death, and yet she was alive too. The r creature
was not only starved with hunger, and terri ed with the
thoughts 01 death, hut, as the men told us afterwards, was
lu-okon-heartml for her mistress, whom she saw dying for twu
or three days hoioro, and whom she loved most tvnderly.
\Ve know not what to do with this poor girl ; for when our
surgeon. who was a man of very great knowledge and ex--
porlenoo, had, with great application, recovered her as to life,
he had her upon his hands still; for she was little less than
distracted fer a considerable time after.

Whoever shall read these memorandum must be desired to _
consider, that visits at sea are not like a journey into the;
country, where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at '
a place. Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's
crew, but not lie by for them ; and though they were willing
to steer the same course with us for some (la s, yet we could
carry no soil to hoop pace with aship that had no masts.
However, as their captain bogged of us to help him to set up
a inaintopinast, and a kind of a topmost to his jury-fore-
mast. we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days ; and
then, having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork,
tWo hogshoads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour,
and what other things we could spare ; and taking three caske
of sugar, some rum, and some pieces-of-eight from them for
satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their
own earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all their
goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with
the loss of his mother, and also at having lost his father but
a few months before, at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon
to speak to me to take him out of the ship; for he said the
cruel fellows had murdered his mother: and indeed, so they
had, that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a
small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, though it had
been but just enough to keep her alive; but hunger knows
no friend, no relation, no justice, no right, and therefore is
remorseless and capable of no compassion. .

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it
would carry him away from all his friends, and put him,
perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as those we found him
in. that is to say, starving in the world. He said it mattered
not whither he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible
crew that he was among; that the captain (by which he meant
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his
life, and he was sure would not hurt him; and as for the
maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be very
thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The
.Ieurgeon represented the case so affectionately to me that I
yielded, and we took them both on board, with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not he removed
or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I
made his commander sign a writing, obliging himself to go, as
soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant
there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver
n. letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had be-
longing to the deceased widow; which I suppose was not
done, for I could never learn that the ship came to Bristol,
but was, as is most robable, lost at sea; being in so disabled
a condition, and so Far from any land, that I am of opinion the
first storm she met with afterwards, she might founder, for
she was leaky, and had damage in her hold, when we met with
her.

I was now in the latitude of 19deg 32', and had hitherto a
tolerable voyage as to weather, though, at first. the winds had
been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents
of wind, weather, currents, dam, on the rest of our voyage;
but, to shorten my story, shall observe that I came to my old
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. It was
with no small difficulty that I found the place; for as I came
to it, and went from it, before, on the south and east side of
the island, coming from the Brazils, so now, coming in
between the main and the island, and having no chart for the
coast, nor any land-mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or

, 'mow whether I saw it or not. We heat about a great while,
' nd went on shore on several islands in the mouth of the
great river Oronooqne, but none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great
mistake before, viz. that the continent which I thought I saw
from the island I lived in, was really no continent, but a long
island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the
other side of the extended mouth of that great river; and
that the savages who came to my island were not properly
those which we call Caribbeea, but islanders, and other348 1.1 in; AND ADVEN'I'UREfl

barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited nearer to our
side than the rest.

In uhort, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not; on one of
them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived
there ; but, speaking with them, found they had a. sloop lying
in a small creek hard by, and came thither to make salt, and
to catch some pearl-mussels if they could; but that they
belonged to the Isle do Trinidad, which lay farther north, in
the latitude of 1" and ll degrees.

'l'hus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with
the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we
had found aconvenient boat, and therefore kept her with their
very good will, at length I came fair on the south side of my
island, and presently knew the very countenance of the place:
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with the
little creek where my old habitation was. As soon as I saw
the place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew where
he was? He looked about a little, and presently clapping his
hands, cried, "0 you, () there, 0 yes, 0 there l " pointing to
our old habitation, and fell dancing and capering like a mad
fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into
the sea. to swim ashore to the place.

" "'0", Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find any-
body hero or no? and do you think we shall see your fathor'l "
The follow stood mute as a stock a good while; but, when
I named his father, the poor, affectionate creature looked
dejected, and I could see'the tears run down his face very
plentifully. " What is the matter, Friday? are you troubled
because you may see your father? "--"No, no," says he,
shaking his head, " no see him mole: no, never mole see him
again." " \Vhy so, Friday? how do you know that 'l "--" 0
no, 0 no," says Friday. "he long ago die, long ago 3 be much
old man." " "'0", well, Friday, you don't know; but shall
we see any one else then 'i " The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than I, and he points tothe hill just above my old house ;
and though we lay half a league off, he cries out, "We se'o,
we see, yes, yes, we see much man there, and there, and
them." I looked, but I saw nobody--no, not with a per-
spective glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit
the place; for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry
the next day; and there were five or six men all together,
wfho stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to think
0 us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the
English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give
them notice we were friends; and in about a quarter of an
hour after we perceived a smoke arise from the side of the
creek; so I immediately ordered the boat out, taking Friday
with me, and, hanging out a white flag, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom
I had told the story of my living there, and the manner of it
and every particular, both of myself and those I left there,
and who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go with
me. \Ve had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if we
had found any new guests there which we did not know of ;
but we had no need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high
water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I
fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved,
and whom I knew by his face perfectly well : as to his habit,
I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered nobody go on shore
at first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the
boat, for the aii'ectionate creature had spied his father at a,
distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw
nothing of him; and if they had not let him go ashore, he
would have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore,
but he flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a bow.
It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest
resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's
joy when he came to his father: how he embraced him, kissed
him, stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down
upon a. tree, and lay down by him ; then stood and looked at

him, as any one would look at a stmnge picture, for a quarter ,,

his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again and stared
at him; one would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it
would have made a dog laugh the next day to see how his
passion ran out another way: in the morning, he walked along
the shore, with his father, several hours, always leading him
by the hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now and
then he would come to the boat to fetch something or other

for him, either a lump of sugar, 9. dram, a biscuit, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics
ran another way; for then he would set the old man down
upon the ground, and dance about him, and make a thousand
antic gestures; and all the while he did this, he would be

VRUSOE KEITH THK SPANIARD ON LANDING.

talking to him, and telling him one story or another of his
travels, and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be found in
Christians to their parents, in our part of the world, one
would be tempted to say there would hardly have been any
need of the fifth commandment.
But this is a digression : I return to my landing. It would
be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities
that the S aniards received me with. The first Spaniard,
whom, as said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had
saved. He came towards the boat, attended by one more,
carrying a flag of trace also; and he not only did not know
me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion of its being me
that was come, till I spoke to him. "Senhor," said I, in
Portuguese, " do you not know me? " At which he spoke
not a word, but, giving his musket to the man that was with
him, threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that
I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me,
telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again
that he had once seen, as of an angel from Heaven, sent to
save his life: he said abundance of very handsome things, as
a well-bred Spaniard always knows how, and then, beckoning
to the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old
habitation, where he would give me possession of my own
house again, and where I should see they had made but mean
improvements. I walked along with him, but, alas ! I could
no more find the place than if I had never been there; for
they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a.
position, so thick and close to one another, and in ten years'
time they were grown so big, that the place was inaccessible,

except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves
only, who made them, could find.

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications:
he told me I would say there was need enough of it, when
they had given me an account how they had passed their time
since their arriving in the island. especially after they had
the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told me he could
not but have some pleasure in my good fortune, when he
heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction ;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time
sr other he should see me again, but nothing that ever befell
him in his life, he said, was so surprising and afliicting to him
at first, as the disappointment he was under when he came
back to the island and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were
left behind, and of whom, he said. he had a long story to tell
"W, the Spaniards all thought themselves much better among
tho savages, only that their number was so small: "and,"
says he, " had thoy been strong enough, we had been all long
ago in purgatory ; " and with that he crossed himself on the
breast. " But, sir," says he, "I hope you will not be dis-
plmtsod when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we
were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, and
make them our suijcts, as they would not be content with
living inodoratoly our masters, but would ho our murderers."
I answered. 1 was afraid of it when I left them there, and
nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that
thoy were not como back, that I might have put them in
plm'oision of uvm'ything first, and loft the othors in a state of
subjection, as they dosorvod; but if they had reduced them
to it 1. was wry glad, and should bo very far from finding
any fault with it: for I know they were a parcel of refrac-
tory, ungovornml villains, and were [it for any manner of
mischief.

"'hilo I waq thus saying this, the man came whom he had
sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they
were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they were of ;
but he made all oloar. both to them and to me. First he
turned to mo, and pointing to them, said, "These, air, are
some of the goullmnou who owe thoir lives to you ;" and then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who
I was; upon which thoy all came up, one by one, not as if
they had [nu-n sailors, and ordinary fellowe, and the like, but
really as if t-hoy had been ambassadors or noblomon, and I
a monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was, to the
last degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with 3
nm'. y, umji'stic gravity, which very well became them; and, -
'in short, they had so much more manners than T. that I scarce i-
lnmv bow to rouoiro their nirilitios, much less how to return '
lln-m in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in. the island, '-
afl-ur my going away, is so very reinarkublo. and has so many
incidents. which the former part of my relation will help to
understand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer
to the account I have already given, that 1 cannot but commit
them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come
after me.
In order to do this as intelligihiy as I can, I must go back
to the circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons
on it, of whom I am to speak. And first, it is necessary to
repeat that I had Rent away Friday's father and the Spaniard
(the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in a
large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over
the Spaniard's companions that he left behind him, in order,
to save them from the like calamity that he had been in, and'
in order to succour them for the present; and that, if possible,
we might together find some way for our deliverance after.
wards. When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance
of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any
more than I had twenty years hefore,---much less had I any
foreknowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, an
English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it
could not be but a very great surprise to them, when they
came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find three
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left
behind me, which would otherwise have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I
might begin where I left off, was of their own part ; and I
desired the Spaniard would give me a particular account of
his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, when I sent
him to fetch them over. He told me there was little variety
in that part, for nothing remarkable happened to them on the
way, having had very calm weather, and a smooth see. As
for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that
they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the principal
man among them, the captain of the vessel they had been
shipwrecked in having been dead some time): they were, he
said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew that
he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were
satisfied, would devour him, as they did all the rest of their,
Eprisoners; that when he told them the story of his deliverance,-
and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away,
it was like a dream to them, and their astonishment, he said,
was somewhat like that of Joseph's brethren when he told
them who he was, and the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's
court; but when he showed them the arms, the powder, the
ball, the provisions, that he brought them for their journey 01
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share

2
of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to
come away with him.

'l'heir first business was to get canoes; and in this they
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but
to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two
large canoes, or imriaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing,
or for pleasure. in these they came away the next morning.
It seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready; for
they had neither clothes, nor provisions, nor anything in tho
fwurld but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of
which they used to make their bread. They were in all three
weeks absent; and in that time, unlurkily for them. I had
the occasion oil'ered for my escape, as I mentioned in the
other part, and to got off from the island, leaving three of
the most impudent. hardened. ungoverned, disagreeable villains
behind me, that any man could desire to meet with--to the
poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment.

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the
Spaniau'ds came ashore, they gave my letter to them. and gave
them provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to
do : also they gave them the long paper of directions which I
had h-ft with them. containing the particular methods which
1 took for managing every part of my life there; the way I
baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn;
how I cured my graims, made my pots, and, in a wool. every-
thing 1 did. All this being written do" n, they "am to the
Spaniards (two of them understood English "ell enouwh):
nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards \\ ith anv -
thing else. for they agreed may well for some time. They
gm o them an equal admission into the house, or cave, and
tlu~3 began to live vel3' soriahly: and the head Spaniard. who
had seen pretty nun h of my methods, together with Friday's
father. managed all their ail'airs; but as for the Englishmen.
they did nothing but ramble about the island. shoot parrots,
'and catch tortoises . and when they rame home at night, the
Spaniards provided their suppers for them

'lhe Spani: irds would have been satisfied with this, 11: id the
others but let them alone w.hirh how-ex er. they could not tind
in their hearts to do long: but. like the dog in the manger,
they would not eat themselves, neither would they let the
others eat. The dillcrenues, nevertheless, \rore at first but
trivial, and such as are not worth relating, but at last it
broke out into open war: and it began with all the rudeness
and insoleuce that can be ixnngined,-without reason, without
provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common
sense; and though, it is true, the first relation of it come
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers,
yet when I come to examine the fellows, they could not deny
a. word of it.

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must
supply a defect in my former relation ; and this was, I forgot
to set down, among the rest, that just as we were weighing
the anchor to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on
board of our ship, which I was once afraid would have turned
to u. second mutiny ,' nor was it appeased till the captain,
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance,
parted them by force, and, making two of the most refractory
follows prisoners, he laid them in irons: and as they had
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly,
dangerous words, the second time he threatened to carry them
in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny
and running away with the ship. This, it seems, though the
captain did not intend to do it, frightened some other men in
the ship; and some of them had put it into the head of the
rest, that the captain only gave them good words for the
present, till they should come to some English port, and that
then they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their lives.
The ninte got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it,
upon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a. great
man among them, should go down with the mate, and satisfy
the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they
behaved well "the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the
time post should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing
my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, and the more
so when I caused the two men that were in irons to be released
and forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night;
the wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our
two men, who had been laid in irons, had stolen each of them
a musket, and some other weapons (what powder or shot they.
had we knew not), and had taken the ship's pinnuce, whicr,
was not yet hauled up, and run away with her go their

'l'hoy \rol'o going on in this little thriving position when the
t-hrve unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in more
humour, and to insult them, come and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs: that the governor, meaning me,
had given them the possession of it, and nobody else had any
right to it; and that they should build no houses upon their
ground, unless they would pay rent for them. Tho two mouJ
thinking they were jesting at first, asked them to come in uml
sit down, and see what tine houses they were that they hm]
. Juilt, and to tell them what rent they demanded; and one of
lthem merrily said, if they were the ground-landlords, he
hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, and mode
improvements, they would, according to the custom of loud-
lords, grant a long loose: and desired they would got a.
Scrivener to draw the writings. One of tho three, cursing
and raging, told them they should see they were not in jest;
and going to 0. little place at 9. distance, where the honest men
had made a fire to dress their vietuuls, he takes a firobrond,
and chips it to the outside of their hut, and set it on fire:
indeed, it would have been all burned down in a few minutes,
if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away,
and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not without some
dilliculty too.

The fellow was in such 9. rage at the honest man's thrusting
him away, that he returned upon him, with a, pole ho had in
his hand, and had not the man avoided the blow very nimhly,
and run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. I-lis
comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, run in after
him, and immediately they come both out with their xnuskets,
and the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked
the follow down that began the quarrel with the stock of his
musket, and that before the other two could come to help him ;

._ and then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together.
and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, hnu'e
them stand 0E.

The others had fire-arms with them too; but one of the
two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and mode desperate
by his danger, told them, if they offered to move hand or foot,-
they were dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay down
their arms. They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but
seeing him so resolute, it brought them to o. poi-lay, and they
consented to take their wounded man with them and be gone:

J'inglishman replied, like a rough tnrpauling, "They might

" But what must they do then, migniori " said the Spaniiu'd.
Another of tho brnton returned, "Do? they should he

" by the same rule, we must be your servants too." "Ay,"
returned the bold dog, "aml so you shall, too, before we
have done with you; " mixing two or ihroe oaths in the
proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at
that, and made him LB answer. However, this little dis-
course had heated them, and starting up, one says to the
other (I think it was he they milled Will Atkins), "Come,
Jack. let's go, and have t'other brush with them; we'll
demolish their castle, I'll warrant you 3 they shall plant no
colony in our dominions."
Upon this they were all creeping away, with every man
a gun, a pistol, and a. sword, and muttered some insolent
things among themselves, of what they would do to the
Spaniards too, when opportunity offered; but the Spaniards,
it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to know all
the particulars, only that, in general, they threatened them
hard for taking the two Englishmen's part. Whither they
went, or how they bestowed their time that evening, the
Spaniards said they did not know; but it seems they
\wandored about the country part of the night, and then
lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they
were weary and overslept themselves. The case was this:
they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the
two poor men when they were asleep, and as they acknow-
ledged afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts while
they were in them, and either burn them there, or murder
them as they came out. As malice seldom sleeps very sound,
it was very strange they should not have been kept awake.360 Li M: AND Am'nx'ruum

was as breve a man as could he, and, withal, a strong, well-

who had tired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, luoing
in the rave. came out. and calling to him not to shoot, they
stopped in, secured the other two, and took their arms from
them.

When they were thus disarmod, and found they had made
all tho Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own (mind-ry-
own. they began to cool. and, giving the Spaniards hotter
words. would have had their arms again; but the Slumiards,
considoring tho fond that was between them and the other
two l'lnglislnm'n, and that it would he the best method they
could take to hoop them from killing one another. told them
they would do them no harm; and if they would live {mace-
ably, they would he very willing to assist and associate with
them as they did before; but that they could not think of
giving them lhui r arms again, while they appeared so resolved
to do niisrhiot' with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them their servants.

'l'he rogues were now quite deaf to all reason, and being
refused their arms, they raved away like lnadmon, threatening
what they would do, though they had no lire-arms. But the
Spaniards, despising their threatening, told them they should
take care how they oll'erod any injury to their plantation or
tattle: for if they did they would shoot them as they would
ravenous. beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell
into their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged.
However, this was far from cooling them, but away they
wont, raging and swearing like furies. As soon as they were
gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage enough also,
though of another kind; for having been at their plantation,
and finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above men.-
tionod, it will easily ho supposed they had provocation enough.
They could scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards
were so eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange enough
to (ind that three men should thus bully nineteen, and re-
ceive no punishment at all. .

The Spaniards. indeed, despised them, and especially, having
thus disarmed them. made light of their threatenings; but
the two Englislunon resolved to have their remedy against.
.them, what pains seever it cost to find them out. But the
Slumiiu'ds interposed here too, and told them, that as they
had disurmed them, they could not consent that they (the
two) should pursue them with lire-arms, and perhaps kill
them. " llut," said the grave Spaniard, who was their gover~
nor, "we will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you
will leave it to us : for there is no doubt but they will come to
us again, when their passion is over, being not able to subsist
without our assistance. We promise you to make no peace
with them without having full satisfaction for you ; and, upon
this condition, we hope you will promise to use no violence
with them, other than in your own defence." Tho two
l'luglishmcn yielded to this very awkwardly, and with great
whwhnwu : but the Spaniards protested that they did it only
tn kccp ihom from bloodshed, and to make the-1n ull eusyat
last. " For," said they, "we are not so many of us; here is
room enough for us all, and it is a great pity that we should
not be all good friends." At length they did consent, and
waited for the issue of the thing, living for seine days with
the Spaniards ; for their own habitation was destroyed.

In about five days' time the vagmnts, tired with wandering,
and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on
turtlos' eggs all that while, came back to the grove; and
finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor,
and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek,
they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and
begged to be received again into the society. The Spaniards
used them civilly, but told them they had acted so unnatumlly
to their countrymen, and so very grossly to themselves, that
they could not come to any conclusion without consulting the
two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they would go
to them and discourse about it, and they should know in
half an hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard
put to it; for, as they were to wait this half-hour for an
answer, they begged they would send them out some bread in
the meantime, which they did, sending, at the some time, a
large piece of goat's flesh, and a boiled parrot, which they ate
very eagerly.

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and
along debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them
with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder
them; all which they owned before, and therefore could not
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them ; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen
not to hurt the three while. they were naked and unarmed, so
they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows'
two huts, one to be of the same and the other of larger di-
mensions than they were before: to fem-o their ground again,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land
again for planting corn. and, in a word. to restore everything
to the same state as they found it, that i:, as near as they
could.

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly,
and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably
together again; only that these three fellows could never be
persuaded to work -'I mean for themselves--except now and
then a little. just as they pleased: however, the Spaniards
told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and
friendly truether, and study the good of the whole plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and let them walk
about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus, having lived
pretty well together for a month or two, the Spaniards let
them have arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad
with them as before.

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad. before the ungrateful creatures began to be as
insolent and troublesome as ever: however, an accident
happened presently upon this, which endangered the safety of
them all, and they were obliged to lay by all private resent-
ments, and look to the preservation of their lives.

It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard
,whose life I had saved, who was new the governor of the
rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by
no means get any sleep : he was perfectly well in body, only
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men fight-
ing and killing one another; but he was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he lay agreat
while, but, growing mom and more uneasy, he resolved to
rise. As they lay, being so many of them, on goat-skins laid
lthick upon such couches and pads as they made for them-
selves, so they had little to do, when they were willing to
rise, but to get upon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat,
such as it was, and their pumps, and they were ready for

going any way that their thoughts guided them. Being thus

got up, he looked out; but, being dark, he could see little or

nothing, and besides, the trees which I had planted, and

which were now grown tell, intercepted his sight, so that he

could only look up, and see that it was a starlight night, and,

hearing no noise, he returned and lay down again; but to no-
purpose: he could not compose himself to anything like rest;

but his thoughts were to the lust degree uneasy, and he knew
not for what. Having made some noise with rising and

walking about, going out and coming in, another of them

waited, and asked who it was that was up. The governor told

him how it had been with him. " Say you so?" says the

other Spaniard; " such things are not to be slighted, I nssme

you ; there is certainly some mischief working near us; " and

presently he asked him, " Where are the Englishmen 2 "--

"They are all in their huts," says he, " safe enough." It seems

the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment, and
had made a place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last

mutiny, were always quartered by themselves, and could not
come at the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, " there is
something in it, I am persuaded, from my own experience. I
am satisfied that our spirits embodied have a converse with,
and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied, end in-

habiting the invisible world ; and this friendly notice is given

for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come,

let us go and look abroad ; and if we find nothing at all in it
to justify the trouble, I'll tell you a. story to the purpose, that

shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it "

They went out presently to go up to the top of the hili
where I used to go 3 but they being strong, and a good com-
pany, nor alone, as I was, used none of my cautions to go up
by the ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up 9. second

men, not of one or two, but of a great number.

one Englishman, to drive away all the goats to the great valley
whom the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the
very cave itself. Could they have soon the savages all together
in one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they were
resolved, if there had been a hundred of them, to attack
tlwm; but that could not be done, for they were some of
them two miles oil' from the other; and, as it appeared after-
wm-da, were of two dill'erent nations.

After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, they resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to send the
old savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them,--as what they came for, what
they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it ; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of
the savages were, away he wont. After he had been gone an
hour or two, he brings word that he had been among them
umlisoovorod;A that he found they were two parties, and of
two several nations, who had war with one another, and had
a grout battle in their own countr ; and that both sides
having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were,
by more chance, landed all on the same island, for the devour-
ing their prisoners and making merr '; but their coming so
by claim-o to the same place had spoiled all their mirth,--
that they were in a great rage at one another, and were so
near, that he believed they would light again as soon as day-
light began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had
any notion of anybody being on the island but themselves.
lle had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they
could lwrceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two
little armies were engaged in a. bloody fight. Friday's father
used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie
close, and not he soon ; he told them their safety consisted in
it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the
savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the
rest would go away; and it was so too tittle. But it was
impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen ; their
curiosity was so importunate, that they must run out and see
the battle: however, they used some caution, too: they did
not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther
into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where
they might seemer see them manage the light, and, as they _
thought. not be soon by them ; but the savages did see them,
as we shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe the
Englishmen. one of them said he could perceive that some of
them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of
great policy in guiding the light. The battle, they said, held
two hours before they could guess which party would be
beaten; but then that party which was nearest our people's
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some time more,
some of them began to fly; and this put our men again into
a great consternation. lest any one of those that fled should
run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and
thereby im'oluntarily discover the place: and that, by con-
sequence. the pursuers would also do the like in search of them.
Upon this. they resolved that they would stand armed within
the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to
mlly out over the wall and kill them, so that. if possible, not
one should return to give an account of it; they ordered also
that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting
them. for fear of mixing an alarm by the noise.

As they expert-ed it fell out; three of the routed army fled
for life. and crossing the creek. ran directly into the place.
not in the least knowing whither they went. but running as
into a thick wood for shelter. The scent they kept to look
abroad gave notice of this within, with this comforting addition,
that the conquerors had not pursued them. or seen which way
they were gone: upon this, the Spaniard governor, a man of
immunity. would not sulfur them to kill the three fugitives,
but sen-ling three men out by the top of the hill, ordered
(hem to go round. come in behind them. and surprise and take
them prisoners: which was done. The residue of the con-
quered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the
victors retired, made. no pursuit, or very little, but drawing
themselves into a body together, gave two great screaming
shouts. most likely by way of triumph--and so the fight ended :
the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon. they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the
island again free to themselves, their fright was over, and they
saw no savages for several years after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their
den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about two-
nnd-thirty men dead on the spot; some were killed with
long arrows, which were found sticking in their bodies; but
most of them were killed with great wooden swords, sixteen
or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle, and
us many bows, with a. great many arrows. These swords
were strange, unwieldy things, and they must be very strong
men that used them; most of those that were killed with
them had their heads mashed to pieces, us we may say, or, as
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several
their arms and legs broken: so that it is evident they fight
with inoxpressihle rage and fury. We found not one man
that was not stone dead ; for either they stay by their enemy
till they have killed him, or they carry all the wounded men
that are not quite dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our ill-disposed Englishmen fore.
grout while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the
consequences ltppfltll'ed terrible to the last degree, especially
upon supposing that some time or other they should fall into
the hands of those cieatures, who would not only kill them
as enemies, but for food, as we kill our cattle; and they
professed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like
beef and mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be
till they were dead, had something in it so horrible that it
nauscated their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with such unusual
terror, that they were not themselves for some weeks after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have
been speaking of ; and for a. great while after they were
tractable, and went about the common business of the whole
seciety well enough--planted, sowed, reaped, and began to
be all naturalized to the country. But some time after this
they fell into such simple measures again, as brought them
into a great deal of trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these
three being stout young fellows, they made them servants.
and taught them to work for them, and as slaves they did
well enough; but they did not take their measures as I did
by my men Friday, viz. to begin with them upon the prin-
ciple of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in
the rational principles of life; much less did they think of

tom-hing them religion. or attempt civilizing and mdncing
them by kind usage and affectionate arguments. As they
gave them their food every day, so they gave them their
work too. mid kept them fully employed in drudgery enough ;
hut- t-hey failed in this by it, tlmt they never had them to
assist. them and light for them as I luul my man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very tlesh upon my bones.

But. to come to the family part2. Being all now good
friends for common danger, as 1 said above. lmd ettectnn-lly
roe-mailed them they began to consider their general eircum~L
stances; and the first thing that eume under consideration
was \rliet-her. seeing the savages pzu'tieulnrly haunted that
side of the island. and that, there were more remote and
retired parts of it. equally adapted to their way of living.
and manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather
move their habitation, and plant. in some more proper place
for their safety. and especially for the security of their
cattle and corn.

Upon this. after long dehate. it was coneluded that they
Wmlld not remove their habitation; because that, some time
or other. they thought they might hear from their governor
again. meaning me: and it [ should send any one to seek
them. i should he sure to direet them to that side. where. if
they should timl the place demolished. they would eonelndo

supply \rnuhl go too. lint. :Is to their eorn and cattle, they
agreed to remove them into the valley where mycavo was,
where the land was :Ls proper for both, and where. indeed,
there was land enough. llon'ever. upon second thoughts,
they altered one part of their resolution toe, and waolved.
only to rumore part of their rattle. thither. and plant part of
their rern there : so that if one part, was destroyed. the other
might lw saved. And one part of prudence they luekily used :'
they u '\'el' trusted those three savages which they had taken
prisoners with knowing anything of the plantation they had
made in that. Valley. or of any eettle they had there. much
less of the care at that plan-e. which they kept. in case of
neeessity, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also
the two barrels of powder, which I had sent them at my
coming away. They resolved. however, not to elumge their
habitation ; yet, as I had carefully covered it. first with a.
wall or fortification, and thou with a. grove of trees, and an
lhoy were now fully convinced their safety consisted entirely
in their being concealed, they set to work to cover and conceal
the place yet more effectually than before. For this purpose
us I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which in time
all gmw up to he trcos, for some good distance befom the
entrance into my apartments, they went on in the some
Winner, and filled up tho rest of that whole space of ground
from tho troos I had not: quite down to the side of the ('l't't'li,
where I lnmlod my floats, and even into the very ooze whore
the tide (lowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or
any sign that there lmd been any landing thereuboutg--thc-se
stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow, they took
care to have them generally much larger and taller than those
which I had planted. As they grow Alpaca, they planted
them so very thick and cl se together, that; when they had
boon three or four years grown, there was no piercing with
the eye nny considerable way into the plantation. As for
that port, which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick
as a man's thigh, and among them they had placed so many
other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a. polisado
a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to
penetrate it, for a little dog could hardly get between the
trees, they stood so close.

But this was not: all; for they did the same b all the
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even to
the side of the hill, leaving no way, not. so much as for them-
selves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to the side of
the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the first
stage up to the top: so that. when the ladder was taken down,
nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could
come at them. This was excellently well contrived : nor was
it; less than what they afterwards found occasion for, which .
served to convince me, that as human prudence has the autho-
rity of Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless the direc-
tion of Providence to set it to work ; and if we listened
carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent
many of the disasters which our lives are now, by our own
negligence, subjected to.

They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and
had no more visits from the savages. They had, ingeed, an

alarm given them one morning, which put them into a great
consternation ; for. some of the Spaniards being out early one
morning on the west side, or end, of the island (which was
that end where I never went, for fear of being discover 1d),
they we1e surprised with seeing above twenty 1 woes of Indians
just coming on shore. They made the best of their way homLl
in hurry enough; and giving tho alarm to their comrades,
they kept close all that day and the next, going out only at
night to make their observation; but they had the gmd luck
to be undisemvered, fer wherever the savages went, they did
not land that time on the island, but pur sued some. other desiun.

And now they had another broil wilh the three English-
men; one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being 111 a r: "e
at one of the three captive slaves, bemuso the fellow had not
done something right which he bid him do, and somned a little
untmctable in his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-
belt, which he were by his side, and fell upon the poor sav: go,
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards,
who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with
the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but strut]: into his
shoulder. so that he. thought he had cut the poor ereaturo's
arm ell". ran to him. and. entreating him not to murder the
poor man. placed himself between him and the sa\': "e, to
prevent the mischief. The follow. being enraged the 111eroat
this. struck at the Spaniard with his hatehot, and swore. he
would serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow. and with a shovel
which he had in his hand (for they were all working in the
field about their corn land) knocked the brute down. Another
of the Englishmen, running up at the same time to help his
cmnrade. knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards
1110111 came in to help their man, and a third Englishman fell
in upon them. They had none of them any fire-arms or an)
other \\ eapons hut hatchots and other tools, except this third
Englishman; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which
he made at the two last Spanimds, and wounded them both.
This fray set the w hole family In an uproar, and mom he];
coming in. they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should be done with them? They

desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what course toTl": SPANIARD INTBRHRB '05 THE SLAVELira AND mvnmuass or noumsos causes. 375

take with them, for they were mischievous to the highest
degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any man; so
that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country, he would
have hanged them; for all laws and all governors were to
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the society
ought to be expelled out of it ; but as they were Englishmen,
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman
.that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he
would use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them
to the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were their
countrymen. One of the two honest Englishmen stood up,
and said they desired it might not be left to them,--" For,"
says he, "I am sure we ought to sentence them to the
gallows;" and with that he gives an account how Will
Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the five
Englishmen join together, and murder all the Spaniards when
they were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to \Vill
Atkins, " How, Seiguior Atkins, would you murder us all?
What have you to say to that?" The hardened villain was
so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and swore
they would do it still before they had done with them. "Well,
but Soignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " what have we done
to you, that you will kill us'l What would you get by killing
us? And what must we do to prevent you killing us?
Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to
the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard
very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage
at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been
held by three men, and withal had no weapon near him, it
was thought he would have attempted to kill the Spaniard
in the middle of all the company. This hair-brain carriage
obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done. The
two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage,
were of the opinion that they should hang one of the three,
for an example to the rest, and that particularly .it should be
he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had
done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition
with the wound ho had 1' 'eeived, that it was thought. he could
not live. But. the governor Spaniard still said No ; it was an
Englishman that, had saved all their lives, and he would never
consent be put an Englishman to death, though he had mur-
dered half of them; nay, he. said if he had been killed
himself by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it
should he that: they should pardon him.

This was my positively inslott'tl on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it : and as nu-reiful counsels are
most apt to Prevail. where they are so earneetly pressed, so
they all came into it : hut then it was to he considered what.
should he done to keep them from doing the llllot'lllef they
designed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means were
to he med for preserving the society from danger. After a
long debate, it. was agreed that they should be disarmcd, and
not permitted to have eitlu r gun, powder, shot, sword, or any
weapon: that. they should he turned out of the. moiety, and
left. to live where they would, and how they would, by them--
selves : but that none of the rest. either Spaniards or English,
:hould hold any kind of converse with them, or have anything
to do with them: that they should he foihid to cmre within
a. certain distance of the l)l:l('0 where the rest. dwelt; and if
they offered to commit- any diwrder, so as to spoil, burn, hill,
or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or
cattle. belonging to the society. they should die. without- money,
and would shoot them wherever they could find them.

The humane governor. musing upon the. sentence, considered
a little upon it ; and turning to the two honest Englishmen,
said, "' llold: you must reflect that it will be long ore they
can raise corn and wattle of their own, and they must not
starve; we must therefore allow them provisions." So he
'aused to be added, that: they should have a proportion of corn
given them to last them eight: months, and for seed to sow, by
which time they might be. supposed to raise some of their
uun: that they should have six mile-legends, four lie-goats,
and six kids given them, as well for present: subsistence as for
a store ; and that they should have tools given them for their
work in the fields, but, they should have none of these tools
or provisions. unless they would swear solemnly that they
"Ulllll not. hurt. or injure any of the Spaniards with them. or
of tlu 1r fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out
to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refrac-
tory, as neither content to go away nor to stay ; but, as there
was no remedy, they wont, pretending to go and choose a
place where they would settle themselves; and some provi-
siom were given them, but no weapons. About four or five
days after. they came again for some victuals, and gave the
governor an account where they had pitched their tents, and
marked thennelroa out a hibitation and plantation; and it
WM a very convenient place iude .d, on the remotost part of
tile lilztnll, N. E., much about the place where I providentially
landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea. in
my foolish attempt to sail round the island.

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and con-
trived them in a manner like my first habitation, being close
unlnr the side of a hill, Irwin,y some trees already growing on
three. sides of it. so that by planting others, it would be very
o-ixily envemd from the sight. unless narrowly searched for.
'i'hey desired some dried goth-skini, for beds and covering,
which were given th nn ; an I up m giving their words that they
would not disturb the rest. or injure any of their plantations,
they give them hatchets, and what other tools they could
spare; some peas, barley, and rice. for sowing ; and, in a
word, anything they wau'ed, except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and
1|:lll got in their first lnrvost. though the quantity was but
small, the parcel of land they had planted being but little.
Judi-oil. luring all their plantation to form, they had a great
deal of work upon their hands; and when they exune to make
hoards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their
element, and could make nothing of it; therefore when the
rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the eurth, they
could not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger of
spoiling. This humbled them much : so they came and
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily
[lid ; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things
from the rain : but it was a. poor place at best, compared to
mine, and especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments in it.

About three quarters n5 9. year after this separation, a. new
frolic took these roguos, which, togot-hor with the former
villany they had cmnmittcd, brought mischief enough upon
them, and had very near boon tho ruin of the whole colony.
The three new asxm'iaios begun, it seems, to bo weary of tho
laborious lilo they led, and that without hopc of hath-ring
their circumstancos : and a whim took thcm that thoy would
make n. voyage. to tho continent. from whonco tho savages
camo, and would try if lhcy could scizo upon some prisoners
among tho nativcs them. and bring them homo. so as to mako
thom do the laborious part of tho work for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no
further. llut they did nothing, and proposed nothing. but had
either mischief in the design. or mischief in tho event. And
if I may givo my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast
from Iloavcn: for if we will not allow a visiblo curso to
pursue visihlo crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of
things with tho Divino justice? lt was certainly an apparent
vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought
them to tho stato they worn in: and they showed not the
least remorso for tho crimo. hut. addod ncw villanios to it,
such as tho picco of monstrous crnolt-y of wounding a poor
slay-o because he did not. or porhaps could not, understand to
do what ho was dircclvd. and to wound him in auoh a manner
as made him a cl'ipplo all his lifo, and in a. plum whom no
surgeon or modicino could ho had for his curo ; and, what was
still worse, tho intentional mnrdcr. for such to ho sm-o it was,
as was anon-wards the formed design they all laid, to murder
the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep.

The thrco follows came down to the Spaniards ono morning.
and in very humblo torms desired to ho admittcd to spunk
with them. Tho Spaniards very readily hoard what. thoy
had to say, which was this :---that they wero tired of living in .
the mannor they did, and that thoy were not handy enough to
make. tho nccossarics they wanted. and that having no help,
thoy found thny should be starved; but if the Spaniards
would give them leavo to tako one of tho canons which thoy
came over in, and giro them arms and ammunition propow
tionod to thoir defonco, thoy would go ovcr to the main, and
seek their fortunes, and so deliver thorn from tho trouble of
supplying them with any other provisions.

The Sluiuiards were glad enough to got rid of them, but

u
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they
were running into ; told them they had suffered such hardships
upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of
prophecy, tell them they would be starved or murdered, and
bade them consider of it. The men replied audaciously, they
should be starved if they stayed here, for they could not work,
and would not work, and they could but be starved abroad;
and if they were murdered, there was an end of them; they
had no wives or children to cry after them; and, in short,
insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring they
would go, whether they gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men,
and be in no condition to defend themselves; and that
though they could ill spare fire-arms, not having enough for
themselves, yet they would let them have two markets, a
pistol, and a cutless, and each man a hatchet, which they
thought was sufficient for them. In a word they accepted
the olfer; and having baked broad enough to serve them a
month given them, and as much goats' flesh as they could eat
while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried grapes, a pot
of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in
tha canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at least
forty miles broad. The boat, indeed, was a large one, and
would very well have carried fifteen or twenty men, and
therefore was rather too big for them to manage; but as
they had a fair breeze and flood-tide with them, they did well
enough. They had made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of
four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced
together; and away they went merrily enough. The Spaniards
"called after them, " Ben wyajo ; " and no man ever thought
of seeing them any more.

; The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the
two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and-
oomfortably they lived, now these three turbulent fellows were
gone. As for their coming again, that was the remotest thing
from their thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, after
two-and-twenty days' absence, one of the Englishmen, being
abroad upon his planting-work, sees three strange men coming
towards him at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders. .

Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as if330 1.11'1'. 111111 A111'12N'1'11111-ts

113 they took in the wars; 111111 then they ow nod they made a
gmut feast, and 1116 their pr'isonexs.
The Englishmen inquiied when they had had a feast of that
kind; and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to
the moon and to two fingers ; and that their great king had
two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war,
and they were feeding them to make them fat for the next
feast. Tho Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing those
prisoners 3 but the others mistaking them, thought they were
desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own
eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of
the sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that
the next morning at snnrieing they would bring some for
them; and, accordingly, the next morning they brought down
five women and eleven men, and gave them to the English-
men, to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would
bring so many cows and oxen down to o seaport town to
victual a ship.

As brntish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest affront to the savage gentry that could he oifered
them, and what to do with them they knew not. However,
after some debate, they resolved to accept of them; and, in
return, they gave the savages that brought them one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets;
which, though they did not understand their use, they seemed
particularly pleased with; and then tying the poor creatures'
hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the boat
for our men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they
had them, or else they that gave them this noble present
would certainly have expected that they should have gone to
work with them, have killed two or three of them the next
morning, and, perhaps, have invited the donors to dinner.
But having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks
that could well pass between people, where, on either side,
they understood not one word they could say, they put (iii
with their best, and came back towards the first island ; where,
when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty,
there being too many of them for their occasion. In their
voyage, they endeavoured to have some communication with
their prisoners; but it was impossible to make them under-
stand anything. Nothing they could say to (hem, or give
them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going to murder
them. They first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures
screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had just
felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately concluded
they were unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave
them anything to eat, it was the same thing; they then con-
cluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be
fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more
particularly, the party presently concluded it was to see
whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first ; nay,
after they had brought them quite over, and began to use
them kindly, and treat them well, still they expected every
day to make a dinner or supper for their new masters.

When the three \rauderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them
where their new family was; and being told that they had
brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts,
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (the
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place and see
them ; and did so, and Friday's father with them. When
they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound ; for when
they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands,
that they might not take the boat and make their escape;
there, I say, they sat. all of them stark naked. First, there
were three comely fellows, well shaped, with straight limbs,
about thirty to thirty-five years of age; and five women,
whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more about
four or five-and-twenty ; and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden,
about seventeen. The women were well-favoured, agreeable
persons, both in share and features, only tawny; and two of
them. had they been perfect white, would have passed for
very handsome women, even in London, having pleasant
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour; especially
when they came afterwards to be clothed and dressed, though
that dress was very indifferent, it must he confessed.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of
the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humour, that
ever 1 met with : and, in particular, of the most modesty: I
say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and
five naked women, all together bound, and in the most
miserable circumstances that human nature could be supposed
to ho, viz. to be expecting every moment to be dragged out,
and have their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up
like a calf that is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's
father, to go in, and see first if he knew any of them, and
then if he understood any of their speech. As soon as the
old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none
of them; neither could any of them understand a word he
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to
satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen
were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women;
and that they might be sure they would not he killed. As
soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy,
and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to
describe; for it seems they were of several nations. The
woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place,
to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work
for the men who had brought them away, to save their lives;
at which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
taking up this, and .another that, anything that lay next,
to carry on their shoulders, to intimate they were willing
to work.

The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently he attended with some inconvenience,
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the
three men what they intended to do with these women, and
how they intended to use them, whether as servants or as
wives? One of the Englishmen answered, very boldly and
readily, that they would use them as both; to which the
governor said: " I am not going to restrain you from it--Tyoni
are your own masters as to that ; but this I think is but Just,
for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it
of you for that reason only, viz. that you will all engage, that
if any of you take any of these women as a wife, he shall take
but one; and that, having taken one, none else shall touch
her; for though we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is
but reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman any of384 1.11'1; 111m Anvnmmms

111111 1111111111 he his wife--I moan," says he, "while he con-
tinues here, and that none also shall have anything to do
with her." All this appeared so just, that every one agreed
to it without any dillieulty.

Then the I'Inglixlnuen asked the Spaniards if they designed
to take any of them? But every one of them answered
" No" name of them said they had 11 hes in Spain, and the
(111111111 did not like 1101111111 that new not ('hnstians' , and all

so they set up 11 new form of living; for the Spaniards and
Friday's father lived in my old habitation. which they had

these c":111ie.d on the main p1'11t of the colony, supplied all the
reat with food. and misisted them in anything 11s they could,
or as they found necessity required.

lrut the 11111111111 of the story was, how five such refiactm y,
ill- matched fellows should ogrie about these women, and that
some two of them should not choose the some 1101111111,
especially seeing two 01' three of them were, without enm-
pmison, nieio agreeable than the others; but they took a
good 11 ~13 enough to plevent quanelling among themselves,
for they set the the "omen by themsolws in one of their
huts. and they went all into the other hut, and drew lots
among them who should choose first.

Iliin tlmt drew to choose first went away by himself to the
hut where tho poor naked creatures were. and fetched out hm?
he. chose ; and it was worth observing. that he that chose first,
took hel that 11 as 191 konod the homeliest and oldeet of tho'
five which made 11111 th enough mnongst the rent; and 01 on the
Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow conside1ed bettoi than
any of them that it was application and business they 11' ore to
expert assistance in, as much as in anything else; and she
proved the. best wife of all the parcel.

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus,
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition
returned upon them again. and they firmly believed they were
now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the English
sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a.
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their
leave of her with such ugonies and affection as would have
grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor was it possible
for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be
inunediutely murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
father, who immediately let them know that the five men,
who were to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for
their wives. When they had done, and the fr'ght the women
were in was a. little over, the men went to work, and the
Spaniards came and helped them; and in a few hours they
had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging
apart; for those they had already were crowded with their
tools, household stufi, and provisions. The three wicked ones
had pitched furthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but
both on the north shore of the island, so that they continued
separated as before ; and thus my island was peopled in three
places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
built.

And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence
are, in such a. disposition of things, I cannot say), the two
honest fellows had the two worst wives; and the three
mprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for
nothing, and neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious
wives; not that the first two were bad wives, as to their
temper or humour, for all the five were most willing, quiet,
passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives;
but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or
industrious, or alike cleanly and neat. Another observation 1!
must make, to the honour of a diligent application on one
hand, and to the disgrace of e slothful, negligent, idle temper
on the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the
several improvements, plantings, and management of the
scrcml little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the
three, that there was no comparison. They had, indeed, hath
of them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, and
the reason was, because, according to my rule, nature dictated
that it was to no purpose to sow more com than they wanted;

23 B
but tho difference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the
fences. and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to be seen at
first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about
choir huts. so that, when you came to the plum, nothing was
to be seen but a wood ; and though they had twice had their
plantation demolished, once by their own country-1mm, and
once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they
had restored all again, and orerything was thriving and
flourishing about them; they had grapes planted in order,
and managed like a vineyard. though they had themselves
never seen anything of that kind; and, hy their good
ordering their vines. their grapes were as good again as any
of the others. They had also found themselves out a wtrcat
in the thickest part of the woods. where. though there was
not a natural care. as .I had found. yet they made one with
incessant lahour of their hands. and where, when the mischief
which followed happened, they secured their wives and
children so as they could never he found; they having, by
sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which, as 1
said, grew so readily, made the grove inqmssaldo. except in
some places. when they ulimhed up to get over the outside
part. and then went on by ways of their own leaving.

As to the three reprohales, as I justly -all tin-in. though
they were much civilised by their settlement compared to
what they were hefore. and were not so (lion-n-lsonie, having
not the same opportunity : yet one of the certain eomyanicns
of a prulligale mind never left Ila-m. and that was their
Idleness. It is tine. they planted coin and made fences;
but Solomon's words were never hotter verified than in them.
"I went by the vineyard of the slothful. and it was all
.overgrown with ihorns:" for when the Spaniards came to
View their crop they could not see it in some places for weeds,
the hedge had several gaps in it. where the wild goats had got
Ill and eaten up the corn: perhaps hero and there a. dead linsh
was erannned in. to stop them out for the present, but it was
only shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen.
\Vhercas, when they looked on the colony of the other two,
there was the very face of industry and success upon all they
did : there was not a. weed to be seen in all their com. or a,
gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the other hand,
verified Solomon's words in another place, "that the diligent
hand maketh rich ;" for everything grew and thrived, and
they had plenty within and without; they had more tamz
cattle than the others, more utensils and necessaries within
doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing
and cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said.

"was a cook's mate on board the ship, they dresxod their
[husbands' victuals very nicely and well; whereas the others.
could not be brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I say, had been cook's mate, did it himself But as
for the husbands of the three wives, they loitered about,
fetched tnrtles' eggs, and caught fish and birds; in a word,
anything but labour ; and they fared amordingly. The
diligent lived well and comfortably, and the slothful hard
and beggarly: and so, I believe, generally speaking, it is all
over the world.

But I now come to a scene different from all that had
happened before, either to them or to me; and the origin of
the story was this: --Early one morning, there came on shore
live or six canoes of Indians or savages, call them which you
please, and there is no room to doubt they came upon the old
errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was new
so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they
did not concern themselves about it, as I did: but having
been made sensible, by their experience, that their only
business was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by
any of the savages, they would go oil again quietly, when
their business was done, having, as yet, not the least notion
of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having
lbuon made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give
notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, and
not show themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place,

' to give notice when the boats went to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right 5 but a disaster spoiled
all these measures, and made it known among the savages
that there ware inhabitants there; which was, in the end,
the desolation of almost the whole colony. After the canoes
with the savages were gone off, the Smniards pooped abroad
again 3 and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place

they new seith upeu and heund: mid afraid. like the
women. that they should he murdered and eaten: for it
seems. these preple think all the world dues as they dn, in
eating men's lleeh ; but they were soon made easy as to that,
and away they carried them.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them
home to the castle, 1 mean to my palace under the hill ; but
they carried them first to the bewar, where was the chief of
their country work, such as the keeping the goats, the plant--
ing the corn, &c.; and afterward they carried them to tho
habitation of the two l'lnglithon. Here they Were not to
work, though it was not much they lllhl for them to do; and
whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they
thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of them run away, and, taking to the woods, they
could never hear of him any more. They had good reason to
believe he got home again soon after in some other boats or
canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks
afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went
elf in two days' time. This thought terrified them excoedingl y;
for they concluded, and that not without good cause indeed,
that if this fellow came home safe among his comrades, he
would certainly give them an account that there were people
in the island, and also how few and week they were ; for this
savage, as observed before, had never been told, and it was
very happy he had not, how many there were, or where they
lived ; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their
guns, much less had they shown him any of their other retired
places; such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat
which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given in-
telligence of them Was, that about two months after this, six
canws of savages, with about seven, eight, orton men in a canoe,
came rowing along the north side of the island, where the}
never used to come before, and landed, about an hour after
sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation
of the two Englishmen, where this escaped men had been
kept. As the chief Spaniard said, had they been all there,
the damage would not have been so much, for not a men of
them would have escaped; but the case differed now very
much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. The two
men had the happiness to discover them about a league off, so
that it was above an hour before they landed; and as they
landed a. mile from their huts, it was some time before they:il'tl LIFE AND ADVICN'I'I'IU'IS

ranld mine at them. New. having great romon to believe that
they were hot ayed, the first, thing they did was to bind the two
slarex whieli were left. and cause two of the three men whom

that. thesarnge.' might think they were all lured wild ; but the
rngue whe came with them was ten running for that. and gave
them an aeemint of it all. for they went. directly to the place.

When the two pnm- frightened men had secured their wives
and goods. they sent the ether slave they had of the three
who canu- with the. women, and who was at. their place by
accident. away to the Spaniards with all speed. to give them
the alarm. and desire speedy help. and, in the meantime. they
leek their arms. and what annnnnitien they had. and retreated
towards the plaee in the weed where their wires were sent;
keeping at a. distanee. yet so that. they might see, if possible,
whieh way the >:I\':lg'es took. ll'lley had not. gene far, but
that [rem a rising grnnnd they could see the little army of
their enemies come on directly to their habitation. and, in a
mnnzent inure. eenhl see all their huts and household stuff
flaming up legelllel'. tn their great grief and inertitimtion;
[or this was a great less in them, irretrievahle, indeed, for
same time. They kept their station for a while. till they
found the savage". like wild hea spread themselves all over
the place. rlnnnmging every way. and every place they could
think ef. in search of prey : and in particnl 2- fur the people,
at when] new it plainly appeared they had intelligence.

The twu l-anlislnnen seeing this. thinking themselvm not
secure where they stood. hecauxo it; was likely some of the
wild people might came that way, and they might come we
many together, theught it- proper to make another retreat
ulmnt. half a mile farther; believing. as it afterwards
happened. that the farther they strolled, the fewer would
be together. Their next. halt was at the entrance into a. very.
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a
tree stood, which was hollow and very large; and in this tree
they both took their standing, resolving to see there what
might oll'or. They had not stood there long before two of the
savages amicared running directly that way, as if they already
had notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack
[hum : and a little way farther they espied three more coming
after them, and live more beyond them, all coming the same
way : besides which, they saw seven or eight more at adistanco,
running another way ; for, in a word, they ran every way, like
sporismen heating for their game. \

The poor man were new in great perplexity whether they
should stand and keep their posture, or fly; but, after a very
short debate with themselves, they considered, that if the
savages ranged the country thus before help come, they might
perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would
be lost; so they resolved to stand them there, and if they
were too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top
of the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend them-
selves, tire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted,
though all the savngw that were landed, which was near
fifty, were to attack them.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether
they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so
take the middle party, by which the two and the five that
followed would be separated; at length they resolved to let
the first two pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree,
and come to attack them. The first two savages confirmed
them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them.
towards another part of the wood ; but the three, and the
five after them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they
had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so
stmight towards them,'they resolved to take them in a. line as
they come; and as they resolved to fire but one at a. time,
perhaps the first shot might hit them all three; for which
purpose the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets
into his piece; and having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a.
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen,
waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree,
so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on.
they plainly saw that; one of the three was the runaway
savage that. had escaped from them ; and they both know him
distinctly. and resolved that. if possibh'. ho should not IIsIIIIIIII.

Our two menl as they confessed to me, were grieved to b0

obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who had no notion of
their (longer; yet, having them all thus in their ower, and
the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to at fly both
higothor among them ; and singling out, by agreement, which
to aim at, they shot together. and killed, or very much
wounded, four of them; the fifth, frightened oven to death,
though not hurt, foll with the rest; so that our men, seeing
them all full together, thought they had killed them all.

Tho belief that the savages were all killed mode our two
men come boldly out from the tree, before they had charged
their guns, which was 0. wrong stop; and they were under
some surprise when they come to the place, and found no loss
than four of them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and
one not at all. This obliged them to fell upon them with the
stocks of their muskots; nnl first they made sure of the
runaway savage, that had besn the cause of all the mischief,
and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out
of thoir pain; then the man that was not hurt at all, came
and kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and
made piteous means to them, by gestures and signs, for his
life, but could not say one word to them that they could
understand. However, they made signs to himto sit down at
the foot of a tree hard by ; and one of the Englishmen, with
n. piece of rope--yarn, which he had by great chance in his
pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they left
him ; and with what speed they could, made after the other
two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of
them, should [ind the way to their covered place inthe woods,
where their wives. and the few goods they had left, lay. They
come once in sight of the two men, but it was at a. great .
distance : however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross
over a. volley towards the see, quite the contrary way from
that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of;
nnd being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree,
where they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was de-
livered by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of
rope-yawn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the foot
of the tree.

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing
what course to take. or how near the enemy might be, or in
what number 3 so they resolved to go away to the place whereHill lll-'l-l AND Anvl-LN'I'I'Iu-zs

their wires were. to soo if all was well there. and to make

and brought him along with them: where. however. they
were obliged to hind him again. as they had the two others
who were left when the third ran away.

The prisoners now hogan to he a burden to them : and they
were so afraid of thoi r escaping. that they "'('l'0ml00 resolving

cave in tho valley. and he. kept there, with two Spaniards to
:zuard them, and have food for their subsistence, which was
done: and they wero hound there hand and foot for that
night.

When the Spaniards ramo, the two Englishmen were so on-
couraged. that they could not sniisfy themselves to slay any
longer there: but taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves,
with four mnskots, and a pistol among them, and two :3th
quart-ensures, away they went. in quest of the savages. And
first they eamo to the (roe where the men lay that had been

I

had been there, for they had attempted to carry their dead
men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, but had
given it over. From thence they advanced to the first rising
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed,
and where they had the mortifiontion still to see seine of the
smoke; but neither could they here 808 any of the sovogea.
They then resolved, though with all possible caution, to go
forward towards their ruined plantation; but, a little before
they come thither, coming in sight of the see-shore, they saw
plainly the savages ell embarked again in their canoes, in order
to be gone. They seemed sorry at first, that there was no
way to come at them, to givi- them 9. porting blow ; but, upon
the whole, they were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being new twice ruined, and all their
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help
them to rebuild, and assist them with neodful supplies. Their
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least
inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for
they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till
till was over), come and offered their help and assistance, and
did, very friendly, work for several days to restore their
habitation, and make necessaries for them. And thus in a
little time they were set upon their legs again.

About two days after this they had the farther satiefnction
of seeing three of the snvnges' canoes come driving on shore,
and, at some distance from them. two drowned men, by which
they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at
sea. which had overset some of them; for it had blown very
lmrd the night after they went oil. However, as some might
mimirry, so, on the other hand, enough of them escaped to
inform the rest, as well of what they had done as of what had
happened to them; and to whet them on to another enterprise
of the some nature, which they, it seems, resolved to attempt,
with soilicient force to carry all before them; for except what
the first men had told them of inhabitants, they could say
little of it of their own knowledge, for they never saw one
man; and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they
had no other witness to confirm it to them.

It was live or six months after this before they heard any
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes
they had either forget their former bad luck, or given over396 m H: mm AIIVEN'I'IYREH

hatchet. Two of the Women could not ho prevailrd upon but
they would come into the light, and they had bows and arrows,
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the
first action happened, which I have spoken of, where the
Indians fought with one another; and the women had hatchets
too.

The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, commanded
the whole; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful follow
for wickedness. was a most daring. bold fellow, commanded
umlrr him. The savages came forward like lions; and our
man, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in
their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a
most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a
small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to
lot the first of them pass by, and then lire into the middle of
them. and as soon as he had tired. to make his retreat as
nimbly as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in
behind the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of
trees before them.

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every
way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and "fill Atkins
lot about fifty of them pass by him; then seeing the rest
('oluo in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men
to lire. having loale their muskets with six or seven
bullets apiece. about as big as large pistol bullets. How
many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the
eomtornation and surprise was inexpressible among the
sum-gm: they were frightened to the last degree to hear
such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle
of their fright, \Vill Atkins and his other three let lly
again, among the thickest of them; and in less than a
minute, the first three being loaded again, gave them 9.
third volley.

lIad Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon
as they had tired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest
of the body been at hand, to have poured in their shot con-
linually, the savages had been effectually routed; for the
terror that was among them came principally from this.
that they were killed by the gods with tlmnder and
lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. But
\Vill Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat:
some of the savages who were at a dietenoe spying them.
came upon them behind; and though Atkins and his men
fired at them also, two or th1eo 8times, and killed above
twenty, retiring as last as they could, yet they wounded
'Atkins himself, and killed one yof his fellow Englishmen
with their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and
one of the Indian s1. ves who came with the women. This
shwo was a. most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately,
killingfi five of th? 111 with his own hand, having no weapon
but one of the armed stares and n hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two
other men killed, 1mm. d to a risinv ground in the 11 end
and the S paniaxds, aftoi thing tlnee volleys upon them:
reheated also; for their number was so g1ent, and they
11cm so desperate, that though above fifty of them were
killed, and more th 111 as many wounded, yet they came
on in the teeth of our men, feailess of danger, and shot
their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed that their
wounded men. who were not quite disabled, 11'-e1o made
outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madnwn.

\Vhen our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman that were killed behind them : and the savages,
when they came up to them, killed than over again in a
w1etched manner, breaking their arms. l1'gs, and heads, with
their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages ,: but finding
our men were gone, they did not seem inclined to pursue them,
but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their
L'usto111,:11nl shouted twice. in token of their victory; after
which. they had the n1o1-titicatio11 to see several of their
wounded men fall, dying.y with the more loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having d1'1111'11 his little body 1111
together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was
'wounded. would have had them march and charge again
1111 together at once: but the Spaniard replied--"Seignior,
Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight: let them
alum: till 111111'ni11g; all the wounded mun will he stiff
and sore with their wounds, and faint with the loss of
blood: and so we shall have the fewer to engage." This
advice was good: but \\'ill Atkins replied merrily, "That
is true. svignior. and so shall" I too: and that is the reason
I would go on while I :1111 warni."-" \\-'1-ll, Soigninr Atkins,"
says the Spaniard. "you have beh11'ed gullantly, and don:1
your part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on 3 but
I think it best to stay till morning : " so they waited. .

But as it was 9. clear moonlight night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men, and a. great noise and hurry among them where they
lay, they afterwards resolved to fell upon them in the night;
especially if they could come to give them but one volley
before they were discovered, which they had a fair oppor-
tunity to do; for one of the Englishmen in whose quarter
it was where the fight began, led them round between the
woods and the sea-side westward, and then turning short south,
they came so near where the thickest of them lay, that, before
they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in among them,
and did dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute
more, eight others fired after them, pouring in their small
shot in such a. quantity, that abundance were killed and
wounded; and all this while they were not able to see who
hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition,
and then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved
to fall in among them all together. They had in each body
eight persons, that is to soy, twenty-two men and the two
women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They divided
the fire-arms equally in each party. as well as the halberts
and stoves. They would have had the women kept back,
but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands.
Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy,
shouting and hellooing as loud as they could; the savages
stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing
the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together.
They would have fought if they had seen us; for as soon as
we come near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and
poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously. But
our men gave them no time, but running up to them, fired
among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends
of their muskcts, their swords, armed stoves, and hatchets,
and laid about them so well, that, in a word, they set up
a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives
which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or
mortally wounded in the two fights about one hundred and
eighty of them ; the rest, being frightened out of their wits,

scoured through the woods and over tho hills, with all the

speed that fear and nimble foot could help them to; and as
we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got
all together to the sea-side, where they landed, and where
their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet;

for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from tho
sea, so that it was impossible for them to go oil' ; nay, the
storm continuing all night, when the tido came up, their>>
.'mmes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so

high upon the shore, that it required inlinito toil to got them

oil ; and some of them were even dashed to pieces against tho-
beach. Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little

rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as well as

they could, they resolved to march to that part of the island

where the savages were fled, and see what posture they were

in. This necessarily led them over the plat-o where the fight

had been, and where they found several of the poor creatures

not quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagree

able enough to generous minds, for a truly great man, though

obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no

delight in his misery. However. there was no need to give

any orders in this ease: for their own savages, who were

their servants, despair-lied these poor crealures with their

ha lchets.

At length they came in view of the place where tho more
miserable remains of tho savages' army lay, where there
appeared about a hundred still; their posture was generally
sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their
mouth, and the head put between the two hands, loaning
down upon the knees. When our men came within two
nuisketsliots of them. the Spaniard governor ordered two
)nuskets to he fired. without hall, to alarm them ; this he did,
that by their countenance he might know what to expect,
whether they were still in heart to tight. or were so heartily
l-eatrn as to be discouraged. and so he might man: (re accord-
ingly. 'l'liis stratagmu took : for as anon as the savages hcard
the iii-st gun, and saw the ilash of the second. they started up
upon their feet in the gleatest consternation imaginable; and
as our men :Hl\:llll'('ll swiftly towards them, they all ran
screaming and yelling away, with a kind of howling noise,
which our men did not understand, and had never heard
before ; and thus they ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had 'been
calm, and they had all gone away to sea ; but they did not
then consider that this might probably have been the occasion
of their coming again in such multitudes as not tobe resisted,

'.or, at least, to come so many and so often, as would quite
desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore,
who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them,
proved the best counsellor in this case: his advice was, to'
lake the advantage that offered, and step in between them
and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the island. They consulted
long about this ; and some were against it for fear of making
the wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and so
they should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to
stir out about their business, and have their plantations con-
tinually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, in short,
he reduced to a life of continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a
hundred men than with a hundred nations; that as they
must destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men. or be
all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed
them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it ,-
so they went to work immediately with the boats, and getting
some dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire, but they were so wet that they would
not burn; however, the fire so burned the upper part, that it
soon made them unfit for use at sea.

When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them
:ame running out of the woods, and coming as near as they
could to our men, kneeled down and cried, "0a, 0a, Warm.
mokoa," and some other words of their language, which none
of the others understood anything of; but as they made
pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to understand
they begged to have their boats spared, and that they would
be gone, and never come there again. But our men were now,
satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, or to'
save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of these:
people from ever going home again: depending upon this,

more: and it. was very I'eIIunkahle that this was the some
barbarous follow that out the poor savage slave with hisor lummsou vuusmz. .103

hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murdered the
Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time
than mine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains
of barley and rice, and got into the manner of planting and
.rnising my corn, and my tome cattle; for now they had, as 1
'lnmy say, n..hundred wolves upon the island, which would
dovonr over rthing they could come at, yet could be hardly
come at themselves.

When they enw wlmt their circunmtnnt-es were, the first
thing they concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive
the savages up to the further part of the island, south-west,
that if any more come on shore they might not find one
another; then, that. they would daily hunt and harass them,
and kill us mnny of them as they could come at, till they had
reduced their number; and if they could at. last tome them,
and bring them to anything, they would give them corn, and
tom-h them how to plnnt. and live upon t-heirduily labour. In
order to this. they so followed them, and so terrified them
with tlu ir guns, that in n iow days, if unyof them fired uglm
at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down
for fear. So dreadfully frightened were they that they kept
out of sight further and further; till, at last, our men fol-
lowed them, and almost every day killing or wounding some
of them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much,
that it reduced them to the ntnmst misery for want of food ;
and many were afterwards found (lend in the woods, without
any hurt, absolutely starved to death.

When our men found this, it made their hearts lelont, and
pity moved them, especiully the generous-minded Spuniord
governor: and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them
alive, and bring him to understand what they meant, so for no
to be able to not as interpreter, and .20 among them ond see if
they might be brought to some conditions that might be
depended upon, to save their lives and do us no harm.

.it was some while before any of them could be token ,' but
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised
and mode a. prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would
neither out nor drink; but finding himself kindly used, and
victunls given to him, and no violence ofiered him, he at last
grew tractable, and come to himself. They often erlzlght old

After this. Ihe colony enjoyed :I perfect tranquillity. with
respect. to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was
about two years after; not but that, now and then. some
canons of savages came on shore for their triumphul, IIn-
natural feasts; but as they were of several nations, and
perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or the
reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after
their countrymen ; and if they had, it would have been very
hard to have found them out.

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that hap-
pulled to them till my return, at least that was worth notice.
"he Indians were wonderfully civilised by them, and they
frequently went among them; but they forbid, on pain of
death, any one of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again. One thing
was very remarkable, viz. that they taught the savages to
make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon outdid their
nmsters: for they made abundance of ingenious things in
wicker-work, particularly baskets, sieves, birdvcages, cup-
boards, (to. ; as also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being very
ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way
of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because
we furnished tln-m with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-
axes, and all things of that kind which they could want.
"With the help of these tools, they were so very handy that
they came at last to build up their huts or houses, very
handsomely, raddling or working it up like basket-work all
the way round. This piece of ingenuity, although it looked
very odd, was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat
as against all sorts of vermin ; and our men were so taken with
it, that they got the Indians to come and do the like for
them; so that when I came to see the two Englishman's
colonies, they looked, at a. distance, as if they all lived like
bees in a hive.

As for Will Atkins, who was new becomeavery industrious,
useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of
basket-work as, I believe, was never seen ; it was one hundred
and twenty paees round on the outside, as I measured by my
steps ; the walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels
or squares of thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing
about seven feet high; in the middle was another not above
twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, being octagon in
its form, and in the eight corners stood eight very strong
posts; round the top of which he laid strong pieces, knit to-
gether with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for406 Ltr r. mm .uwt-tsrt'mas

of tho inner circln; and four largo warehouses, or barns, or
what you please to call them, which went through one another,
two on either hand of the passage, that led through the outer
door to the inner tent. Such a piece of basket-work, I believe,
was never seen in the world, nor a house or tent so neatly
contrived, much less so built. In this great bee-hive lived
the three families, that is to say, Will Atkins and his com-
panion; the third was killed, but his wife remained with three
children, and the other two were not at all backward to give
the widow her full share of everything, I mean as to their
corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or found a.
turtle on the shore ; so that they all lived well enough;
though, it was true, they were not so industrious as the other
two, as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for
religion, I do not know that there was anything of that kind
among them; they often, indeed, put one another in mind
that there was a God, by the .very common method of seamen,
swearing by His name: nor were their poor ignorant savage
wives much better for having been married to Christians, as
we must call them; for as they knew very little of God them-
selves, so they were utterly incapable of entering into any
discourse with their wives about a God, or to talk anything to
them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the
wives had made from them was, that they had taught them to
speak English pretty well 3 and most of their children, who
were near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too,
from their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke
it in a very broken manner, like their mothers. None of
these children were above six years old when I came thither,
for it was not much above seven years since they had fetched.
these five savage ladies over; they had all children, more or
less: the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet"-
laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one another"
mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I cannot call
them husbands), and lacked nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married ; both of
which were happily brought about afterwards by my means,
or at least in consequence of my coming among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my runagete Englishmen, I must say some-
thing of the Spaniards, who were the main bony of the
family, and in whose story there are some incidents also
remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their cir-
cumstances when they were among the savages. They told
me readily that they had no instances to give of their
application or ingenuity in that country; that they were a
poor. miserable, dejected handful of people; that even if
means had been put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned
themselves to despair, and were so sunk under the weight of
their misfortune, that they thought of nothing but starving.
One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was con-
vinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part of
wise men lo give themselves up to their misery, but always
to take hold of the. helps which reason olIered, as well for
present support- as for future deliverance: he told me that
grief was the. most senseless, insignificant passion in the
world. for that it regarded only things past, which were
gem-rally impossible to he recalled, or to be remedied. but had
no views of things to come, and had no share in anything that
looked like deliverance but rather added to the affliction than
proposed a remedy; and upon this he repeated 3. Spanish
proverb. which. though I cannot repeat in the same words
that. he. spoke it. in. yet I remember I made it into an English

proverb of my own. thus :--

" ln trouble. to be troubled,
ls to have your trouble doubled."

lie then ran on in remarks upon all the little improvements
T had made in my solitude: my unwearied application, as he
called it : and how I had made a condition, which in its
circumstances was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand
times more happy than theirs was, even now when they were
all together. He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen
had a greater presence of mind, in their distress, than any
people that ever he met with; that their unhappy nation and
the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to struggle
with misfortunes; for that their first step in dangers, after
the common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under
it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper
remedies for escape.
I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without
supply of food, or present- sustenance till they could provide
for it; that, it was true, I had this further disadvantage and
discomfort, that I was alone; but then the supplies I had
proridentially thrown into my hands, by the unexpected
driving of the ship on shore, was such a help as would have
encouraged any creature in the world to have applied himself
as I had done. " Soignior " says the Spaniard, " had we poor!
Spaniards been in your cam ve should never have got half those
things out of the ship, as :ou did: nay," says he, " we should
never have found means to have got a raft to carry them, or
to have got the raft on shore without heat or sail; and how
much less should we have done, if any of us had been alone! "
"Well, I desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with
the history of their coming on shore, where they landed. He
told me they nnhappily landed at a place where there were
people without provisions ; whereas, had they had the common
sense to put off to see. again, and gone to another island a
little further, they had found provisions, though without
people: there being an island that way, as they had been told,
where there were provisions, though no people--that is to say,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there. and
had filled the island with goats and hogs at several times,
where they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and
sea-fowls were in such plenty, that they could have been in
no want of flesh, though they had found no bread ; whereas,
here, they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs,
which they understood not, and which had no substance in
. them, and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough;
and they could treat them no better, unless they would turn
'cannibals, and eat men's flesh.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to'
civilise the savages they were with, and to teach them rational
customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how
they retorted upon them, as unjust, that they, who came there
for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for in-
structors to those that gave them food; intimating, it seems,
that none should set up for the instructors of others but those
who could live without them. They gave me dismal accounts
of the extremities they were driven to; how sometimes thev
were many days without any food at all, the island they were

upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more
indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with the
necessaries of life than they had reason to believe others were
in the same part of the world : and yet they found that these
Ravager: were 1052: ravenous and voracious than those who had
better supplies of food. Also they added, they could not
but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodnes'e'
the governing providence of God d'i'eets the events of things'i
in this world. which' they said: ppearod in their circum-
stances: for if, pressed by the .'"-n.v.iships they were under.
and the harrenness of the country where they were, they had
searched ail-er a hotter to live in, they had then been out of
the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.
They then gave me an account how the savages whom they
lived amongst exported them to go out with them into (heir
wars ; and. it was true. that as they had lire arms with (hem,
had they not had the disaster to lose their annuunition. ihey
could have been servieealile not only to their friends, hot have
made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies: but
being without powder and shot, and yet in a condition that
they could not in reason deelino to go out with their landlords
to their wars; so when they came into the field of battle,
they were in a. worse condition than the savages themselvea,
for they had neither hows nor arrows. nor could they use those
the savages gave them. So they could do nothing but stand
still and he wounded with arrows, till they came up to the
teeth of their enemy: and then. indeed, the three halhords
they had were of use to them; and they would often drive
a whole little army before them with those hallverds. and
sharpened stieka put into the monies of their musket-s.
But. for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with multi
tudes. and in great danger from their arrows, till at last they
found the way to make themselves large targets of wood,
which they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names
they knew not. and these covered them from the arrows of
the say: "es : that. notwithstamling these. they wow sometimes
in great danger; and five of them were once knocked down
together with the clubs of the savages, which was the time
when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the
Spaniard whom I relieved. At first they thought he. had been
killed; but when they afterwards heard he was taken prisOner,
they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and would
willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him.

They told me that when they were so knocked down, till
rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them
fighting till they were come to themselves, all but him whom
'they thought had been dead ; and then they made their way

(with their halberds and pieces, standing close together in a

line, through a body of above a thousand savages, beating
down all that came in their way, get the victory over their
enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with the
loss of their friend, whom the other party, finding alive,
carried oli', with some others, as I gave an account before.
They described, most afiectionately, how they were surprised
with joy at the return of their friend and companion in
misery, who they thought had been devoured by wild beasts
of the worst kind, wild men; and yet, how more and more
they were surprised with the account he gave them of his
errand, and that there was a Christian in any place near,
much more one that was able, and had humanity enough to
contribute to their deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the sight of
the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of
broad--things they had not seen since their coming to that
miserable place; how often they crossed it and blessed it as
braid sent from Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was
to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had
sent for their supply; and, after all, they would have told me
something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and
pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from
whence all three new comforts came. But it was impossible
to exlu'ess it by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving
them to unlit-coming oxtravugances, they had no way to do-
scribo them, but by telling me they bordered upon lunacy,
having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the
sense th it was upon them; that in some it worked one way,
and in some another; and that some of them, through a
surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad,
and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely
ali'ected me, and called to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he
met his father, and the poor people's ecstasy when 1 tool: them
up at sen of tor their ship was on fire; the joy of the mate of
the ship when he found himself delivered in the place where
he expected to perish; and my own joy, when, after twanty-
eight years' eaptivit-y, 1 found a good ship ready to carry
we to my own country. All those things made me more
sensible ol' the. rotation of these poor men, and more affected
with it.

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found
them. i must relate the. heads of what I did for these people,
and the condition in which I. left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too. that they would be troubled no more with tho
savages. or if they were, they would be able to cut them
oil". if they were twice as many as before; so they had no
concern about that. Then I entered into a serious discourw
with tho Spaniard. whom I call governor, nbout their stay in
the island : for as I, was not come to carry any of them oil". so
it would not be. just to carry olT some and leave others. who,
perhaps. would be unwilling to stay if their strength was
diminished. On the other hand, I told them I come to
establish them there. not to remove them; and then 1 let
them know that 1 had brought with me relief of sundry
kinds for them: that I had been at a great charge to supply
them with all things newsxary, as well for theirconvenience as
their defence; and that 1 had such and such particular persons
with me. as well to increase and recruit their number, as by
the particular necessary employnients which they were bred
to, being nrtiticers. to axsist them in those things in which at
present they were in want.

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought. I asked
them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first;
nnimosities that had been among them, nnd Would shake'
hands with one another, and engage in a strict h'lt'ndhhil) and
union of interest. that so there might be no more misunder-
standings and jealousies.

\Vill Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good
humour, said they had met with ntlliction enough to make
them all sober. and enemies enough to make them all friends ;
that, for his part, he would live and die with them, and was
so far from designing anything against the Spaniards, that ho
owned they had done nothing to him but what his own mad
humour made necessary, and what he would have done, and
perhaps worse, in their case; and that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he
had done to them, and was very willing and desirous of living
in terms of entire friendship and union with them, and would
do anything that lay in his power to convince them of it; and,
as for going to England, he cared not if he did not go thither
those twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill
conduct, as they had let me know, and they appealed to me
for the necessity they were under to do so; but that Will
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they
had with the savages, and on several occasions since, and had
showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general
interest of them all, that they had forgotten all that was
passed, and thought he merited as much to be trusted with
arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them ; that they
had testified their satisfaction in him, by committing the
command to him next to the governor himself ; and as they
had entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
acknowledged they had merited that confidence by all the
methods that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted ;
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me
this assurance, that they would never have any interest
separate from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appointed the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we
made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate

. to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's
mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six
pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's
provisions, with our punchbowl, and materials to fill it; and,
in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and
ten bottles of English beer ; things that neither the Spaniards
nor the English had tast for many years, and which it may
be supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to
our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted; and three
of them were sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore,
as we did with their salt meat from on board.

we4 l4 LII-1': AND nm'l-m'runre'.

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry,
1 brought my cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be
no dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was a
sulliciem-y for them all, desiring that they might all take an
ultlul quantity, when made up, of the goods that were for
wearing. As. first 1 distributed linen sullicienttemake every
one of them {our shirts, and, at the Spaniard's request, after-
wards made them up six; these were exceeding comfortable
to them, having been what they had long since forgot the use
of, or what it was to wear them. I allotted the thin English
stull's, which I mentioned before, to make every one a light
coat, like a frock, which I judged lillost for the heat of the
season, cool and loose: and ordered that whenever they de-
enyed, they should make more, as they thought lit; the like
for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, the. I cannot express what
pleasure sat upon the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and how well I
had furnished them. They told me 1 was a father to them ;
aml that. having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a
part of tho world, it would make them forget that they were
left in a desolate place: and they all voluntarily engaged to
me not it) leave the. place without my consent.

Then 1 pre<enled to them the people I had hrought with
me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the. two carpenters,
all of them most necessary people ; but, above all. my general
artilieer, than when) they could not name anything that was
more useful to them ; and the tailor, to show his concern for
them. went to work immediately. and, with my leave, made
them every one a shirt, the first. thing he did: and, what was
still more. he taught the women not only how to sew and
stitch, and use. the needle, but made them assist to make the
shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest. As to (he;
current-0N. I scarce need mention how useful they were; tori
they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made
clever convenient tables, stools, hodsteads, cupboards, lockers,
shelves, and everythingthey wanted of that kind. But to let
than see how nature made artilicers at first, I carried the
carpenters to see Will Atkins' basket-house, as I called it;
and they both owned they never saw an instance of such
natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so
handily built, at least of its kind ,' and one of them. when he
saw it, after musing a good while, turning about to me. "I
am sure," says he, "that man has no need of us 5 you need
do nothing but give him tools." -

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had
no barrows or plough ; and to every separate place a pickaxe,
a crow, a. broad axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as
iofton as any were broken or worn out, they should be supplied'
without grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.
'Nnils, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and
all sorts of ironwork, they had without reserve, as they re-
quired ; for no man would take more than he wanted, and he
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account
whatever; and for the use of the smith, I left two tons of
unwrought iron for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice
at them; for now they could march as I used to do, with a
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion; and were
able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little
advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if
they had occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober,
well educated, religious young woman, and behaved so
inofiensively that every one gave her a good word; she
had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman
in the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After
a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way
of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came
to me, and desired I would give them leave to remain
on the island, and be entered among my family, as they
called it. I agreed to this readily; and they had a little
plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three tents
or houses set up, surrounded with a. basket-work, palisadoed
like Atkins', adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were
contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to
lodge in, and a middle tent like a great storehouse, to lay
their goods in, and to eat and to drink in. And new the
othor two Englishman removed their habitation to tho name
pluco; and so tho island was dividod into throo colonies, and
no nlorc, viz. tho Spaniards, with old Friday and tho first
sol-rants, at my habitation under the hill, which was, in a
word, tho capital city, and whoro they had so enlarged and
oxtcndod thoir works, as well under as on tho outsido of tho
hill. iliat they lirod. though pcrfcctly concoalod, yct full at
largo. Novor was thcro such a littlo city in a wood, and so
hid, in any part of tho world: for l wrily lwliorc that a
thonsxuld mcn might have rangod tho island a month.
and, if thoy had not known thcro was such a thing, and
lookod on purposo for it, thoy would not haro found it.
lndocd, tho trccs stood so thick and so close. and grow
so fast wovon ono into anotlior, that nothing but cutting
thcm down first could discover the place, cxccpt tho only
two narrow ontranccs whoro thoy wont in and out could ho
found, whirh was not voryoasy; ono of thom was closo
down at tho watcr's odgo, on tho side of tho crock, and
it was aftcrwards ahoro two hundred yards to tho plaro:
and tho othcr was up a ladder at twice. as l haro olrcady
doscrilwd it ; and they had also a largo wood, thickly planted,
on tho top of tho hill. containing abovo an acro, which grew
apaco. and conccalod tho placo from all discovor ' (how. with
only ono narrow placo hctwcon two treos, not oasily to he
discovored. to cntor on that sido.

'J'ho othcr colony was that of 'Vill Atkins, whcro thoro
woro four families of Englishmen, I moan thoso 1 had loft
thoro. with thoir wircs and children: three :uu'agos that
wcro sl:|\'L'.\'. tho widow and tho childicn of thc l'Inglish-
man (hat was killcd. tho young man and tho maid. and,
by tho way. \\'u mado a. wil'o of her lu-l'oro wo wont awn)'.
'l'horo \vcro ln-sidos tho two carpentors and tho tailor, whom
I brought with mo for tlicnl: also tho smith. who was a \1 r3;
ncccss: ' man to thrill, cspocially as a gunslnith. to tako cam
of thoir arms: and my other man. whom I callcd Jack-of all"
tradcs. who was in himself as good alliiost as twonty own:
for hc was not only a Tory ingcnions follow, but a \'cry merry
follow. and hoi'orc I wont away wc married him to tho hours-t
maid that came with tho youth in the ship 1 nmntioncd
bci'orc.

And our I speak of marrying, it brings mo naturally to
say something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought
with me out of the ship's crew whom I tool: up at sea. It is
true this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give offence
to some hereafter if I leave anything extraordinary upon
record of a man whom, before I begin. I must (to set him
out in just colours) represent in terms very much to his
disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as, first, that
he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest; and, thirdly,
a French Popish priest. But justice demands of me to give
him a due character; and I must say, he was a grave, sober,
pious, and most religious rson ; exact in his life, extcnsivc
in his charity, and exemp ry in almost everything he did.
What then can any one say against being very sensible of the
value of such a man, notwithstanding his profession? though
it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of
others who shall read this, that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse with him after he
had agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason
to delight exceedingly in his conversation ; and he first began
with me about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable.
" Sir," says he. "you have not only under God (and at that
he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted
me to go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging
civility, have taken me into your family, giving me an
opportunity of free conversation. New, sir, you see by
my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation
what yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it
is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring
all the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to
embrace the Catholic doctrine; but as I am here under your
permission, and in your family, I am bound in justiw to your
kindness, as well as in decency and Igood manners, to be under
your government; and therefore shall not, without your
leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion in
which we may not agree, further than you shall give me
leave."

I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but
acknowledge it ; that it was true we were such people as they
call heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had
conversed with, without falling into inconveniences, or carr ~
ing the questions to any height in debate: that he should not

' n n418 ms: AND mvmrrunss

find himself tho worse used for being of it different opinion
from us, and if we did not converso without any dislike on
oit-hor sido. il- should ho his fault. not ours.

llo ropliod that ho thought nll our conversation might
ho easily sopnrm-od from disputes; that it was not his
husinoss to cup principles with every man he convorsod with ;
and that. ho rnthor (losirod nm to mnrorso with him as u

sail. moi supposing he should meet with a. ship there bound to
Moi-tinico, he went on board, in order to soil to the Madeims;
but the muster of the Portuguese ship being but an indifferent
nmrinor, had been out of his reckoning, and they drove to
Falynl: whoro. however. he happened to find a. very good
market for his rorgo, which was com. and therefore resolved
not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle of May,
and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in
this exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty
good voyage as for no the Banks (so they cell the place
where they catch the fish), where, meeting with a French
ship bound from France to Quebec, and from thence to
Mul'tinice, to carry provisions, he thought he should have
an opportunity to complete his first design; but when he
(none to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel
min-mm no further; so the next voyage be shipped himself for
France, in the ship that was burned when we took them up at
sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I have
already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five voyeges,'
all. as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have
occasion to mention further of him. \

But I shall not make digression into other men's stories
which have no relation to my own; so I return to what
concerns our afiairs in the island. He came to me one
morning (for he lodged among us all the while we were upon
the island), and it happened to be just when I was going to
visit the Englishmen's colony, at the furthest part of the
island ; I say, he came to me, and told me, with a very grave
countenance, that he had for two or three days desired an
Opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped would
not be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some
measure correspond with my general design, which was, the
prosperity of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at
least more than he yet thought it was, in the way of God's
blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse,
and turning a. little short, " How, sir," said I, " can it be said
that we are not in the way of God's blessing, after sucln.
visible assistanoee and deliverances as we have seen here, ands
of which I have given you a large accounti"---"If you had'
pleased, sir," said he, with a world of modesty, and yet great
readiness, " to have heard me, you would have found no room
to have been displemd, much less to think so hard of me,
that I should suggest that you have not had wonderful
assistances and deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf,
that you are in the way of God's blessing, and your design is
exceeding good, and will prosper. But, sir, though 2it were

I) n
more so than is even possible to you, yet there may be some
among you that are not equally right in their actions: and
you know, that in the story of the children of Israel, ono
Achan in the camp removed God's blessing from them. and
turned His hand so against them, that sixand-thirty of them,
.thnugll not concerned in the crime, were the objects of divine
vengeance, and bore the weight of that punishment.

I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him
nis inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so
sincere, and was really so religious in its own nature. that I
was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to go
on; and. in the. meantime, because it seemed that what we
had both to say might take up some time. ]. told him I was
going to the. l'lnglishmen's plantations, and asked him to go
with me. and we might discourse of it by the way. He told
me he would the more willingly wait on me. thither. because
there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to
me about : so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and
plain with me in what. he had to say.

" Why, then, sir." says he, " be pleased to give me leave to
lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of what 1 have
to say, that we may not dill'er in the general principles, though
we may be of some differing opinions in the practice of par-
ticulars. First. sir. though we dillcr in some of the doctrinal
articles of religion (and it is very unhappy itis so, especially in
the case before us, as I shall show afterwards), yet there are
some general principles in which we both agree--that there is a
God ; and that this God having given us some stated general
rules for our service and obedience, we ought not willingly
and knowingly to offend Him, either by neglecting to do what
He has commanded, or by doing what He has expressly for-

this general principle is readily owned by us all, that the
blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous
sinning against llis command; and every good Christian will
be alfectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his
care living in a total neglect of God and His commands. It

I could not yet imagine what be aimed at, and told him I
granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would
so far concern himself for us: and begged he would explain-
the particulars of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to
take his own parable, I might put away the accursed thing
from us. a

" Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you'
give me; and there are three things, which, if I am right"
must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your endeavours
here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake and their own.
to see removed. And, sir, I promise myself that you will
fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name them;
especially because I shall convince you that every one of them
may, with great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be
remedied. First, sir," says he, " you have here four English-
men, who have fetched women from among the savages, and
have taken them as their wives, and have had many children
by them all, and yet are not married to them after any stated
legal manner, as the laws of God and man require. To this,
sir, I know, you will object that there was no clergyman or
priest of any kind to perform the ceremony; nor any pen and
ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have
it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you, I mean of the agreement
that be obliged them to make when they took those women,
viz. that they should choose them out by consent, and keep
separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of 9. mar--
riage, no agreement with the women, as wives, but only an
agreement among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling
But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he
nlled it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual
consent of the parties to take one another as man and wife,
but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the
contract to compel the man and woman, at all times, to own
and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to abstain
from all other women, to engage in no other contract while
these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to
provide honestly for them and their children; and to oblige
the women to the same or like conditions. on their-side. New.

"WE
sir," says be, "these men may, when they please, or when
occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their children,
leave them to perish, and take other women, and marry them
while these are living;" and here he added, with some
warmth, " llow, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful
liberty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours
in this place, however good in themselves, and however
siucew in your design, while these men, who at present
are your subjects, under your absolute government and
dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery 'l "

I confess I was struck with the thing itself. but much mole
with the convincing arguments he supported it with : but 1
thought to have got oil my young priest by telling him that
all that part was done when l. was not them : and that they
had lived so many years with them now, that if it was
adultery, it was past remedy; nothing could be done in
it now.

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such freedom, you
are right in this, that. it being done in your absence, you could
not he charged with that part of the crime: but, 1 beseech
you, Hatter not yourself that you are not, therefore, under an
obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to it. You
should legally and ell'octually marry them; and as, sir, my
way of marrying may not be easy to reconcile them to,
though it will be efl'eetuul, even by your own laws, so your
way may be as well before God. and as valid among men. .[
mean by a written contract. signed by both man and woman,
and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe
would decree to be valid."

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sin>>
,cerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse
<<as to his own party or church, and such true warmth for
preserving people that he had no knowledge of or relation to,
from transgressing the laws of God. But rccollecting what
he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which I
knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and
told him I granted all that he had said to be just, and on his
part very kind; that I would discourse with the men upon
the point now, when I came to them; and I knew no reason
why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I
know well enough would be granted to be as authentic and
valid in England as if they were married by one of our own
clergyman.

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much
his debtor for the first, and thanked him heartily for it. He
told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the
second, and hoped I would take it as well; and this was, that,
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he called
them. had lived with these women almoet seven years, had
taught them to speak English, and even to reed it, end that
they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding,
and capable of instruction, yet they had not, to this hour,
knight them anything of the Christian religion--no, not so
much as to know there was it (led. or a worship, or in what
manner God wan to be served, or that their own idolatry, and
worshipping they know not whom, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was en unaccountable neglect, and what God
would certainly call them to account for, and perhaps at last
take the work out of their hands. He sznke this very
all'octionately and warmly.

" lain persuaded," says he, " had those men lived in the
savage country whence their wives came, the savages would
have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters,
and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as I
can see, have taken with them to teach the knowledge of the
true God. Now, sir,"naid he. " though I do not acknowledge
your religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad to see the
devil's servants and the subjects of his kingdom taught
to know the general principles of the Christian religion ;
that they might, at least, hear of God and u Redeemer,
and of the resurrection, and of a. future state--thing>>
which we all believe; that they might, at least, he so much
nearer coming into the bosom of the true church than they
are now in the public profession of idolatry and devil.
worship."

I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and
embraced him eagerly. "How far," said I to him, "have I
been from understanding the most essential part of a. Christian,
viz. to love the interest of the Christian church, and the good
of other men's souls! I scarce have known what belongs to

'the being a Christian."--"0h. sir! do not say so," replied
no; " this thing is not your fault."--" No," said I; " but why
did I never lay it to heart as well as you? "--" It is not too
late yet," said he ; " be not too forward to condemn yourself.' '
--~-" But \1 hat can be done now?" said I. "you seal am going
away." --" Will you give me leavoto talk with these poor men
about it'l"---"Yes, 111th all my hear, " said I: " and will
oblige them to give heed to what you say too." ---"As to
tlmt," said he, " we must leave them to the mercy of Christ;
but it is your business to assist them, encourage them, and
instruct them ; and if you give me leave, and God his blessing,
I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought.
home to the gieat cinlo of Christianity, if not into the par-
ticular faith we all e111b1ace, and that even while you stay
hell'. " Upon this 1 said, "I shall not only give you leave,
but give you a thousand thanks for it."

I. now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame. " \Vhy, really," says he, "it is of the some nature. It
is about your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your con-
quered subjects. It. is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to he
received among all Christians, of what church or pretended
church soex er, that the Christian knowledge ought to be pro-
pagated by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. It
is 011 this p1inciple that our church sends missionmies into
Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, even of the
superim amt, willixnvly engage in the most hazaidous voyages,
and the most dangerous residence amongst murderers and bar-
barians to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to
bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir. you
hm e such an opportunity how to have six or seven- "and thi1ty

1001 savages bro1wht over PS10111 :1 state of idolatry to the
howled-w of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder
how you can pass such an occasion of doing good, which it
really worth tho expense of a man's whole life."

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to
my. I had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and
mligion before 1110. As for me, I had not so much as enter-
tained a thought of this in my heart before, and I believe I
should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these
savages as slaves, and people whom. had we not had any work
for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have
been glad to have transported them to any part of the world;
for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all have
been satisfied if they had been sent -to any country, so they
had never seen their own. I was confounded at his discourse,
and knew not what answer to make him.

He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion--"Sir,"
says he, " I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you
any ofience."--" No, no," said I, " I am offended with nobody
but myself ; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think
that I should never take any notice of this before, but with
reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, ,'
sir," said I, " what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the
East Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, .and to whom it
would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship
here, the men lying all this while at victuals and wages on the
owners' account. It is true, Iagreed to be allowed twelve days
here, and ii I stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling
per diem demurrege; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight
days more, and I have been here thirteen already; so that
I am perfectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would
suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which case, if
this single ship should misoarry in any part of her voyage,
I should be Just in the same condition that I was left
in here at first. and from which I have been so wonderfully
delivered." He owned the case was very hard upon me as to
my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the
blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing
all I had in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as he
was. I replied to him thus : " Why, sir, it is a valuable thing,
indeed, to bean instrument in God's hand to convert thirty-
seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an
ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so it seems so
naturally to fall in the way of your profession; how is it,
then, that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it
than to press me to do it? " j

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along,
and putting me to a full stop, made me a. very low bow. " I
most heartily thank God and you, sir," said be, "for giving
me so evident a call to so blessed a work ; and if you think
yourself discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all
the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, disappointed126 LII-'15 AX!) .\l)\'l" 'l'lllll'Ih' 0|" ROBINSON CllCSOK.

I discovered :L kind of rapturo in his face while he spoko

I was sensibly touched at; his requesting Friday, he nuso I
could not. think of parting with him. and that, for many
reasons; ho had been the companion of my travels; ho was
not- only faithful to me, but sincerely allectionatu to the lust
degree; and I had resolved to do something considerahlo for
him if he outlived me. as it was probable he would. Then I
knew that. as l hml ln'ed Fri-lay up to be a Protestant, itTHE PRIKST uuulu I'III WNVI'MION (IV THE IBUI'Jwould quite confound him to bring him to embrace another
religion; and he would never, while his eyes were 0 en,\
believe that his old master was a heretic, and woul be
damned; and this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's
principles, and so turn him back again to his first idolatry.

owever, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it-
was this: I told him I could not say that I was willing to
'part with Friday on any account whatever, though a work that
to him was of more value than his life, ought to be of much
more value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But,
on the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no
means agree to part with me; and I could not force him to it
without his consent, without manifest injustice; because I
had promised I would never send him away, and he had
promised and engaged to me that he would never leave me,
unless I sent him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one
word of their language, nor they one of his. To remove this
difficulty, I told him Friday's father had learned Siam} h,
which I found he also understood, and he should serve in as
an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to con-
:firtlflhgem ; but Providence gave another very happy turn to

t ' .

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and
after some account given them of what I had done for them,
viz. what necessary things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and
very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous
life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the'
clergyman had taken of it; and arguing how unchristian and
irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were married
men or hmhelorst They soon explained their condition to me,
and showed that two of them were widowers, and the other
three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what
conscience they could take these women, and call them their
wives, and have so many children by them, and not belawfully
married to them? They all gave me the answer I expected,
viz. that there was nobody to marry them; that theyagreed
before the governor to hoop them as their wives, and to main-
tain them and own them as thoir wives ; and they thought, as
things stood with them, they worn as legally married as if
thoy had been married by a parson and with all the formalities
in tho world.

[ told thorn that no doubt they were married in tho sight
of God. and wero bouml in conscionco to km'p them as their
wives: but that tho laws of men boing otherwise. they might;
lost-rt tho poor womon and ehildrou horoat'thor: and that their
wives. lioing poor dosohito womon. friondless und moneyloss,

should continuo together as man and wife: for that, it was
both scandalous to men and otl'onsive to God. who they could
not think would luloss thom if they went on thus.

.-\ll this went- on us I expect-ml; and they told me. ospoeially

loved their wivos as Well as if they had been horn in thoir

what-over: and they did verily believe thut- their wives weru
as virtuous and as modest. and did. to tho utmost. of their

could possibly do; and they would not. put-t- with them on any

This was just as 1 would have it. Tho priest. was not with
me :it that moment. hut- wus notfur off: so to try him further.
i told him 1 had a elergymmi with me. and, if ho was sincere.
1 would have him married next. morning. and bade him con-
sider of it. and talk with the rest. 110 said. as for himself,
ho neod not consider of it. at all. for ho was very ready to do
it. and was glad I had a minister with me. and ho believed
they would be. all willing also. I then told him that my
friend. the minister. was a Frenchman, and could not speak
English, but I would act the clerk between them. He never
so much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant,
whieh was. indeed, whatl was afraid of. We then parted,
and 1 went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in
to tall: with his companions. I desired the French gentleman
not to say anything to them till the business was thoroughly
ripe: and l' told him what answer the men had given me.

liefore I went from their quarter. they all mine to me, and
told me they had been considering what l' lllld mid ; that they
were glad to hear I had a elergyman in my company, and they
\rere very willing to give me the ratisfaction I desired, and
to be formally married as soon as l pleased; for they were
far from desiring to part with their wives, and that they
meant nothing but what was very honest when they chose
them. So ] appointed them to meet me the next morning;
and, in the meantime. they should let their wives know the
waning of the marriage law; and that it was not only to
prevent any scandal. but also to oblige them that they should
not forsake them, whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of
the thing. and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed,
they had reason to be: so they failed not to attend all together
at my apartment next morning, where I brought out my
clergyman; and though he had not en a minister's gown,
afler the manner of England. or the habit of a. priest, after
the manner of France, yet having a black vest something like
a tussock. with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a
minister; and as for his language, I was his interpreter. But
the seriousness of his behaviour to them. and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, because they were not baptized
and profeSsed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence
for his person; and there was no need. after that, to inquire
whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed. I was afraid his
scrnples would have been carried so far as that he would not
have married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was
able to say to him, be resisted me. though modestly, yet very
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless
he had first talked with the men and the women too; and
though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed
to it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design.
When he name to them. he let them know that 1 had
iii-quaintml him with their oireumstiuicos, and with the present
design; that ho was very willing to perform that part of his
function. and marry them. m: I had desired; lmt that before
he could do it. he must take the liberty to talk with them.
He told them. that in the sight of all indill'oreut men, and in
the sense of the laws of smioty. they had lived all this while
in a state of sin; and that it was true. that nothing but the
consenting to marry, or olloctnally sewn'ating them from one
another, could now put an end to it; but there was a dillicull-y
in it too. with respect to tho laws of Christian matrimony.
which he was not fully satisfied about. that of marrying one
that is a professed Christian to a savage. an idolatol'. and a
heathou,~--one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not
see that there was time left to endoiwour to persuade tho
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of Uhrist. whom
they had. he donhtoil. heard nothing of, and without which
they could not ll' lmptized. lle told them he doubted they
were but imlill'ereut Christians themselves; that they had
but little knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he
could not expect that they had said much lo their wires on
that head yet; but that unless they would promise him to use
their endmvours with their wives to persuade them to become
Christians. and would. as well an they could, instruct them in
the knowledge and belief of God that made them, and to wor-
ship Jesus ('hrist that redeemed them, he could not marry them;
for he Would have no hand in joining Christians with savages,
nor was it consistent with the principles of tho ("-hristiau
religion, and was, indeed. expressly forbidden in God's law.

'.l.'hey heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very "
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words an
I could: only sometimes adding something of my own, to
convince them how just it was. and that I was of his mind ;
and 1 always very faithfully distinguished between what I
said from myself, and what wore the clergymnn's words.
They told me it was very true what the gentleman said, that
they were very indifferent Christians themselves. and that
they had never talked to their wives about religion. " Lord,
sir." says Will Atkins, " how should we teach them religion?
Why. we know nothing ourselves; and besides, sir," said he,
"should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and
heaven and hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us
what we believe ourselves. And if we should tell them that
we believe all the things we speak of to them, such as of good
people going to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they
would ask us, where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all
this, and are such wicked follows as we indeed nre'i Why,
sir, 'tiu enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first'
hearing; folks must have some religion themselven before theyi
begin to teach other people."--" Will Atkins." said I to him,i
" though I am afraid that what you say has too much truth in
it. yet can you not tell your wife she in in the wrong; that
there is a (iod, and a religion hotter than her own ; that her
gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak ; that
there is a great lining that made all things, and that can
destroy all that he has made; that ho rewards the good and
punishes the bud: and that we are to be judged by him at
last for all we do here? You are not so ignorant, but even
nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and 1 am
satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself."
-- --" That in true, sir," said Atkins, ; " but with what face can
I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me
immediately it cannot be true '3 "---" Not true I " said I; " what
do you mean by that? "--" Why, sir," said he, " she will tell
me it cannot be true that this God I shall tell her of can be
just. or can punish or reward, since I am not uniuhed and
Fl'llia to the devil, that have been such a. wioke creature as
she knows I have been, even to her, and to everybody else;
and that 1 should he suffered to live, that have been always
acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, and to
what I ought to have done."-----" Why, truly, Atkins," said I,
" l am afraid thou speakeet too much truth; " and with that
l informed the clergyman of what Atkins had said, for he
'was impatient to know. "0h," said the priest, "tell him
(there isone thing will make him the best minister in the]
world to his wife, and that is, repentance; for none teach
wpontnnce like two penitents. He wants nothing but to
repent. and than he will be so much the better qualified to
instruct his wife; he will then be able to tell her that there
is not only a God. and that he in the just rewarder of good
and evil, but that he is a merciful being, and with infinite
goodness and long-suffering forbears to punish those that

ment, till they come into another world; and this will lead
him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of
the last judgment. Let him but repent himself, he will bean
iexcellent preacher of repentance to his wife."

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all
the while, and, as we could easily perceive, was more than
ordinarily aliected with it ; when being eager, and hardly
suffering me to make an end --" I know all this. master,"
says he, " and a great deal more; but I have not the im-
pudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience
know, and my wife will be an undeniable evidence against me,
that I have lived as if I had never heard of a God or future
state, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas l
(and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the
tears stood in his eyes) 'tis past all that with me."---" Post it,
Atkins'i " said I: "what dost thou mean by that? "--" I
know well enough what I mean," says he; " I mean 'tis too
late, and that is too true."

I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said, and this
affectionate man could not refrain from tears; but, recovering
himself, said to me, " Ask him but one question : Is he easy
that it is too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not
so 'l " I put the question fairly to Atkins; and he answered,
with a great deal of passion, " How could any man be easy in
a condition that must certainly end in eternal destruction?
that he was far from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he
believed it would one time or other ruin him."--" What do,
you mean by that? " said I. " Why," he said, " he believed
he should one time or other out his throat, to put an end to the
terror of it."

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his
face, when I told him all this 3 but turning quick to me, upon
it, says, "If that be his case, we may assure him it is not too
late; Christ will give him repentance. But pray," says he,
"explain this to him; that as no man is saved but by Christ,
and the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him.
how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he
think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine
mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear,
but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we,
that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at
all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that
sincerely repent : so that it is never too late to repent."

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnest-
ness ; but it seemed as if he turned 08 the discourse to the
rest, for he said to me, he would go and have some talk with
his wife; so he went out a while, and we talked to the rest. I
perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of
religion, as much as I was when I went rambling away from
my father; yet there were none of them backward to hear
what had been said; and all of them seriously promised that
thoy would talk with their wives about it, and do their
endeavours to persuade them to turn Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last
shaking his head, "We that are Christ's servan ," says he,
"can go no further than to exhort and instruct: and when
men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask,
'tis all we can do ; we are bound to accept their good words;
but believe me, sir," said he, " whatever you may have known
of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe he is
the only sincere convert among them: I will not despair of
the rest; but that man is apparently struck with the sense of
his past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion
to his wife, he will talk himself efiectnally into it: for attempt-
ing to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching
ourselves. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, he will assuredly talk
himself into a thorough convert, make himself a penitent, and
who knows what may follow."

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above,-
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity,
he married the two other couple ; but Will Atkins and his
wife were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waitin; }
a while, was curious to know where Atkins was gone, and
turning to me, said, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, " St.
Paul! St.1'aull behold.he prayeth." I was afraid Atkins
would hear him, therefore i entn'ated him to withhold himself
a while, that We might see. an end of the scene, which to me,
1 must confess, was the most affecting that ever I saw in my
life. Well, he strove with himself for a while, but was in
such ruptures, to think that the poor heathen woman was
become a Christian, that he was not able to contain himself ;
he wept several times, then throwing up his hands and cross
ing his breiwt, said over several things ejaculatory, and by the
way of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of
the success of our endeavours. Some he spoke softly, and I
could not. well hear others; some things he said in Latin,
some in h'roneh ; then two or three times the tears would in-
terrupt him, that he could not speak at all ; but I begged that
he would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and fully
observe what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene
not being near ended yet; for after the poor man and his wife
were risen again from their knees, we observed he stood talk-
ing still eagerly to her, and we observed her motion, that she
was greatly affected with what he said, by her frequently
lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such
other postures as ex rose the greatest seriousness and atten-
tion: this continue about half a quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away, so we could are no more of them
in that situation.

I took this interval to say to the clergyman, first, that I
was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to;
that, though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet
that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the
man and his wife. however ignorant they might both he, and
I hoped such a beginning would yet have a more happy end :
" lint, my frien ," added I, " will you give me leave to start
one dilliculty here? I cannot tell how to object the least
thing against that affectionate concern which you show for the
turning of the poor people from their Paganism to the
Christian religion ; but how does this comfort you, while these
people are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic
church, without which you believe there is no salvation? so
that you esteem these but heretics, as effectually lost as the
Pagans themselves."

To this he answered. with abundance of candour, thus:
"Sir, lam a ('atholic of the Roman church, and a priest of
the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of
the Roman faith ; but yet, if you will believe me, and that I
lie not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my cir.
cumstancos and your cirilities; 1 say nevertheless, I do not
look upon you, who call yourselves reformed, without some
charity. I dare not say (though I know it is our opinion in
general) that you cannot be saved; I will by no means liuit
the mercy of Christ so far as think that he cannot receive
you into the bosom of his church, in a manner to us unpercciv-
able ; and 1 hope you have the same charity for us: I pray
daily for your being all restored to Christ's church, by what--
soever method 119., who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In
the meantime. surely you will allow it consists with me as a
Roman to distinguish far between a Protestant and a Pagan ;
between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which
I do not think is according to the true faith, and asavage or a
barbarian. that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and
if you are not within the pale of the Catholic church, we hope
you are nearer being restored to it than those who know no-
thing of God or of his church : and Irejoicc, therefore, when I
see this poor man, who. you say, has been a prolligate, and
almost a murderer. kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as
we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened; believing
that God, from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly
touch his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of
that truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife,
I can never believe that he shall be cast away himself. And
have I not reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer any are brought
to the knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought
quite home into the bosom of the Catholic church just at the
time when I desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to
perfect his work in his own time, and in his own way?
Certainly, I would rejoice if all the savages in America were
brought, like this poor woman, to pray to God, though they
were all to be Protestants at first, rather than they should
continue Pagans or Heathens ; firmly believing, that He thator summer Cltli-'iUl-l. 439

had bestowed the first light on them would further illuminate
them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them into
the pole of his church when he should see good."

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious
Papist, us much us I was oppressed by the power of his
reasoning; and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if
such a temper was universal, we might be all Catholic Christ
ions, whatever church or particular profession we joined in;
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right
principles; and as he thought that the like charity Would
make us ull Catholics, so I told him I believed, had all tho
members of his church the like modemthm, they would soon
all be Protestants. And there we left that port; for we
never disputed at all. However, I talked to him another way,
and taking him by the hand, " My friend," says I, " I wish
all the clergy of the Romish church were blessed with such
moderation, and had an equal share of your charity. I am
entirely of your opinion; but I must tell you that if you should
preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you
into the 1nquisition."--" It may be so," said he; " I know not
what they would do in Spain or Italy ; but I will not say they
would be the better Christians for that severity; for I am sure
there is no heresy in abounding with charity."

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business
there was over, so we went back our own way; and when we
came back, we found them waiting to be called in : observing
this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush or not ; and it was his
opinion" we should not, but that we should talk to him first,
and hear what he would say to us : so we called him in alone,
nobody being in the place but ourselves, and I began by asking
him some particulars about his parentage and education. Ile

ltold me frankly enough that his father was a clergyman who
would have taught him well, but that he, Will Atkins, despised
all instruction and correction; and by his brutish conduct cut
the thread of all his father's comforts and shortened his days,
for that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most afiectionate treatment a father ever gave.

In what he said there seemed so much sincerity of repent-
ance, that it infully affected me. I could not but reflect
that I. too, he? shortened the life of a good tender father by440 1.er an>> Ant'nnruass

my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. '[ was, indeed, so
surprised with what he had told me, that I thought, instead of
my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made
a teacher and instructor to me in a most unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
allected with it. and said to me, "Did I not say, sir, that
when this man was converted he would preach to us all? I
tell you, sir, if this one man be made a true peniteut. here
)will he no need of me: he will make Christians of all in tho
dsiand."--But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins. " But \Vill," said I, " how
comes the sense of this matter to touch you just no"r 7 "

W. A.----Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a
dart through my very soul : I have been talking about God
and religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me. to make
a Christian of her, and she has preached such a sermon to me
as I shall never forgot while I live.

If. 0.-----No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you; but
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience
has (lung them back upon you.

W. A.--Ay, sir. with such force as is not to be resisted.

If. 0.--Pray, \Vill, let us know what passed between you
and your wife; for I know something of it already.

W. A.--Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it ;
I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it;
but let her have said what she will, though I cannot give you
an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved to
amend and reform my life.

R. C'.----But tell us some of it: how did you begin, \Villl
For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She
has preached a sermon, indeed, if she has wrought this open
you.

W. A.---\Vhy, I first told her the nature of our laws about
marriage, and what the. reasons were that men and women
were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in
the power of one nor other to break; that otherwise, order
and justice could not be maintained, and men would run from
their wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with
one another, and neither families be kept entire, nor inheri-
tances be settled by legal descent.

R. C.--You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her
understand what you meant by inheritance and families!
They know no such things among the savages, but marry
anyhow, without regard to relation, consanguinity, or family;
brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father
and the daughter, and the son and the mother.

W. A.---l believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps,
for any further relations, they may not be so exact as
we are; but she tells me never in the near relationship you
speak of.

R. C'.----Well, what did she say to what you told hex-t

W. A.--She said she liked it very well, as it was much
better than in her country.

R. C.--But did you tell her what marriage was'i

W. A.---Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her if
she would be married to me our way. She asked me what
way that was; I told her marriage was appointed by God;
and here we had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man
and wife had, I believe.

N.B--This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife,
Ivhich I took down in writing just after he told it me, was as
ollows :--

Wife.--Appointed by your God 1 Why, have you a God in
your country 'I

W. A.----Yes, my dear, God is in every country.

Wife--No your God in my country; my country have the
great old Bonamuckee God.

W. A.--Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is;
God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea,
and all that in them is.

Wife--No makes de earth; no you God makes all earth;
no makee my country.

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.

Wife--No laugh ; why laugh me? This no tins: to laugh.

[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more,
serious than heat first.]

W. A.--That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any more
my dear.

Wife--Why you say you God makes all!

W. A.--Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you,
and me, and all things ; for he is the only true God, and them
is no God but him; he lives for ever in heaven.

Wifi.--\Vhy you no tell me long ago?

W. A.--Th:it's true, indeed ; but I have been a wicked
\vrotch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
anything before, but have lived without God in the world
myself.

Wife--What, have you a. great God in your country, you no
know him? No say 0 to him? No do good ting for him?
That no possible.

W. A.--It is true; though, for all that, we. live as if there
was no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

Wife--But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you
good live?

W. A.--It is all our own fault.

Wife--But you say me he is great, much great, have much
great power ; can makes kill when he will : why he no umkeo
kill when you no serve him? no say 0 to him? no be good
mans l

W. A.--Thst is true, he might strike me dead ; and I ought
to expect it, for I have been a. wicked wretch, that is true;
but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.

Willa--But then do you not tell God thunkee for thottool

W. A.--No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy,
any more than I have feared God for his power.

Wife--Then you God no God 3 me no think, believe he be
such one, great much power, strong : no makee kill you,
though you make him much .

W. A.--Wha.t, will my wicked life hinder you from believing
in God! What a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad
truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the con-
version of hesthensl

Mfi.--How me tink you have great much God up then
[she points up to heaven], and yet no do well, no do good
ting! Can he tell? Sure he no tell what you do? _

W. A.---Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hears us
speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do
not speak. '

Mfi.--Whetl he no hear you curse, swear, speak do great
dsmn 'l

W. A.--Yes, yes, he hears it all.

u
or nomnsos causes. 443

Wife--Where be then the much great power strong?

W. A.--He is merciful, that is all we can say for it ; and
this proves him to be the true God 5 he is God, and not men,
and therefore we are not consumed.

[Hero Will Atkins told us he was struck with honor. to
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and
hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and all,
that we do, and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things
he had done.]

Wife.-- Merciful I What you call dot?

W. A.--He is our father and maker, and he pities and
spares us.

ll'g'fex-- So then he never makes kill, never angry when you
do wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able.

W. A.~--Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and in-
finitely greut, and able to punish too; and sometimes, to show
his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger to destroy
sinners and make examples 3 many are cut off in their
sins.

Wilt--But no makes kill you yet; then he tell you, may
be, that he no makes you kill: so you makes de bargain with
him, you do bad thing, he no be angry at you when he be
angry at other mans.

W. A.---No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon his
goodness; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me,
as he has done other men.

WifiL--Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what
you say to him for that? You no tell him thankee for all
that too?

W. A.--I am on unthnnkful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.

Wife--Why he no makee you much good better? you say
he makes you.

W. A.--He made me as he made all the world: it is I have
deformed myself and abused his goodness, and made myself
on abominable wretch.

Wife--I wish you makee God know me. I no makes him
angry--I no do bad wicked thing.

[Here Will Atkinsseid his heart sunk within him, to hear
a poor unteught creature desire to be taught to know God,
and hr .1 uch a wicked wretch, that he could not say one word
to her about God, but what the reproach of his own carriage
would make most irrational to her to believe; nay, that
already she had told him that she could not believe in God,
because he, that was so wicked, was not destroyed]

W. :l.--My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to
know God, not God to know you ; for he knows you already,
and every thought in your ln-urt.

ll'i/h.-- -Why, then. he know what I say to you now: he
know me wish to know him. How shall me know who
nmkee me?

W. A.---Poor creature, he must teach thee: I cannot teach
thee. I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and
forgive me, that am unworthy to teach thee.

[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him
to make her know God, and her wishing to know him. that he
said he fell down on his. knees before her, and pmyod to God
to enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his bring the
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of
religion: after which he sat down by her again, and their
dialogue went on. This was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and hold up his hands.]

Wifi.--"'liat you put down the knee for? \Vhat you hold
up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to?
What is all that?

W. A.----1\Iy dear, I bow my knees in token of my sub
mission to him that made me: I said O to him, as you call it.
and as your old men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I
prayed to him.

Wife--What say you 0 to him for?

W. A.--I prayed to him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know him, and be accepted by him.

Wife-Cum ho do that too?

W. A.--Yes, he can : he can do all things.

"Va--But now he hear what you say"!

11'. .-i.--Yes, he has hid us pray to him, and promised to
hear us.

Wye--Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid
you? What you hear him speak?

W. A.--No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that
God has revealed himself to us by his word, and what his
woul was; but at last he told it her thus :--]
W. A. --God has spoken to some good men in former da y,s
even from heaven, by plain words; and God has inspiredg 00d

min 1113 his Spirit; and they have written all his laws down 1n
11. oo

Wi e.--Me no understand that; where is book?

W. A .---Alasl my poor c1eature, I have not this book; but
I hope I shall one time or othel get it for you, and help you
to read it.

[Here he embraced her with great afi'ection, but with inex-
pressible grief that he had not a Bible]

W fa. --But how you makes me know that God teachee them
to write that book!

W. A.--By the same rule that we know him to be God.

"We--What rule? What way you know himi

W. A. ---Because he teaches and commands nothing but what
is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly
good, as well as perfectly happ y; and because he forbids, and
commands us to avoid, all that 18 wicked, that 15 evil in itself,
or evil' in its consequence.

Wife--That me would understand, that me fain see ; if he
teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all
thing, he hear me when I say 0 to him, as you do just now;
he makes me good, if I wish to be good 5 he spare me, no
makes kill me, when I no be good : all this you say he do, yet
he be great God; me take, think, believe him to be great God;
me say 0 to him with you, my dear.

He1e the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her
up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to
instruct her in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and
that by some good providence, if possible, she might, some
time or other, come to have a Bible, that she might read the
"Word of God, and be taught by it to know him. This was
the time that we saw him lift hei up by the hand, and saw
him kneel down by her, as above.

They had several other discourses, 1t seems, after this; and
part1cula1ly she made him promise that since he confessed his
ou-n life had been a wicked, abominable course of p1ovocations
against God, that he would 1oform it, and not make God angry446 me A!!!) onsuruass

any more, lest he should make him dead, as she called it, and
then she would be left alone, and never be taught-to know this
led better; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told
her wicked men would be after death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both,
but particularly to the young clergyman; he was, indeed,
wonderfully surprised with it, but under the greatest affliction
imaginable that he could not talk to her, that he could not
speak English, to make her understand him ; and us she spoke
but very broken English, he could not understand her; how-
ever, he turned himself to me. and told me that he believed
that there must be more to do with this woman then to marry
her. I did not understand him at first ; but at length he 0. -
plaiued himself, viz. that she ought to be baptized. I agreed
with him in that part readily, and wished it to be done
presently. "' N o, no ; hold, sir," says he; " though I would
have her be baptized, by all means. for I must observe that
Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a won-
derful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life, and
has given her just ideas of the being of a God ; of his power,
justice, and mercy: yet I desire to know of him if he has said
anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of
sinners: of the nature of faith in him, and redemption by
him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment,
and the future state. "

1 called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but the poor
fellow fell immediately into tears, and mid us, he had said
something to her of all those things, but that he was himselfl
so wicked a creature, and his own conscience so reproaohed
him with his horrid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the
apprehensions that her knowledge of him shculd lessen the
" ttention she should give to those things, and make her rather
eontemn religion than receive it; but he was assured, he said
that her mind was so disposed to receive d ue impressions of nl
,those things, and that if I would but discourse with her, she
'1 would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would

not be lost upon her.

Accordingly I called herin, and placing myself as interpreter
between my religious priest and the woman, 1 entreatod him
to begin with her: bift sure such a sermon was never preached
by a Popish priest in these latter ages of the world ; and, as I
told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all
the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a. Roman
Catholic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the
Roman bishops were, before the church of Rome assumed
spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men. In a. word,
he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of
Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder and aston-
ishment only, as she did the first notions of a. God, but with
joy and faith; with en affection, and a surprising degree of
understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be express-
ed ; and, at her own request, she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entrested him that
he would perform that oilice with some caution, that the man
might not perceive he was of the Roman church, if possible,
because of other ill consequences which might attend a differ-
ence among us in that very religion which we were instructing
the other in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel,
nor proper things for the oflice, I should see he would do it in
a manner that I should not know by it that he was a Roman
Catholic myself, if I had not known it before ; and so he did;
for saying only some words over to himself in Latin, which I
could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water upon
the women's heed, pronouncing in French, very loud, " Mary
(which was the name her husband desired me to give her, for
I was her godfather), I baptize thee in the name of the Father, .
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; " so that none could
know anything by it what religion he was of. He gave the
benediction afterwards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did
not know but it was French, or else did not take notice of
it at that time.

As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the
marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very
affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in, but to support the convictions
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life: told
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his
crimes; represented to him how God had honoured him with
being the instrmncnt of bringing his wife to the knowledge of
the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he did
not dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did, he would
see the heathen at better Christian than himself 3 the savage
converted, and the instrument east away. He said a great

many good things to them both ; and then. recommending them

to (:od's goodness. gave them the benediction again, I repeating
everything to them in English; and thus ended the ceremony.

I think it was the most pleasant and agreeable day to me that

over 1 passed in my whole life. But my clergyman had not

done yet : his thoughts hung continually upon the conversion

of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would have stayed

upon the island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him,

first, that his undertaking was imprmtieahlo in itself; mul,'
secondly, that porimpa i would put it into a way of being done '
in his absence to his mtisimstion.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow com-
pass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young
man I had taken out of the famishod ship's company came to
inn. and told he understood I had a clergyman with me, and
( hat I had caused the lilnglishmon to he married tothe savages :
that ho had a match too, which he desired might be finished
before i went. between two Christians, which he hoped would
not he disagreeable to me.

I knew this must he the young woman who was his mother's
servant. for there was no other Christian woman on the island:
so I hogan to persuade him not to do anything of that kind
raahly, or because he found himself in this solitary circum-
shnre. ] represented to him that he had some considerable
substance in the world, and good friends, as I understood by
himself . and the maid also; that the maid was not only poor,
and a servant. but was unequal to him, she being six or seven
and twenty years old. and he not above seventeen or eighteen;
that he might very probably, with my assistance, make a
remove from this wildernese, and come into his own country
again ; and that then it would be a thousand to one but he
would repent his choice. and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. i was going to say more,
lad he interrupted me. smiling. and told me, with a great deal
of nuxlesty, that l mistook in my guesses,---that he had
nothing of that kind in his thoughts: and he was very glad
in hear that I had an intent of putting them in a way to see
their own country again; and nothing should have made him
think of staying there, but that the voyage I was going was
so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite
out of the reach of all his friends ; that he had nothing to
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little
property in the island where he was, give him a servant or
two, and some few necessaries, and he would live here like a
planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I returned to
England, I would redeem him. He hoped I would not he un-
mindful of him when I came to England: that he would give
me some letters to his friends in London, to let them know
how good I had been to him, and in what part of the world.
and what circumstances I had left him in: and he promised
me that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the
improvements he had made upon it, let the value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his
youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I
would deliver his letters, and do his business efl'ectually; and
that he might depend I should never forget the circumstances
I had left him in 3 but still I was impatient to know who was
the person to be married; upon which he told me it was my
Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably
surprised when he named the match; for, indeed, I thought it
very suitable. The character of that man I have given
already ; and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religious young woman: had a very good share of
sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand-
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when
requisite, nor impertinently forward when it was not her
business ; very handy and housewifoly, end an excellent
manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess to the whole
island; and she knew very well how to behave in every respect.

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them
the same day ; and as I was father at the altar, and gave her
away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her
husband a handsome large space of ground for their plants.-
tion; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the young
gentleman made to give him a small property in the island,
put me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might
not quarrel afterwards about their situation.

2 r
This sharing out the land to them I left .30 Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly
reformed, exceedingly pious and religious; and, as for as 1
may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily
believe he was a true penitent. He divided things so justly,
and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I
caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed, setting out the
bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and testifying
that 1 gave them thereby severally a right to the whole pos-
session and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms
with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all
the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent
for every particular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing
an attested copy of the same writing. As to the government
and laws among them, I told them I was not capable of giving
them better rules than they were able to give themselves;
only I made them promise me to live in love and good neigh~
hum-hood with one another; and so I prepared to leave
them.

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being new
settled in a kind of Commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was odd to have seven-and-
thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independent, and,
indeed, unemployed; for excepting the providing themselves
food, which they had diilioulty enough to do, sometimes they
had no manner of business or property to manage. I pro-
posed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he should go
to them. with Friday's father, and propose to them to remove,
and either plant for themselves, or be taken into their several
families as servants, to be maintained for their labour, but
without being absolute slaves ; for I would not permit them
to make them slaves by force, by any means; because they
had their liberty given them by capitulation, as it were
articles of surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all
very cheerfully along with him: so we allotted them land and
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in the several families we
had settled Thus my colony was ins. manner settled as
follows :--The Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city, and extended their plantations all
along the side of the brook, which made the creek that I have
so often described, as far as my bower; and as they increased
their culture, it went always eastward. Tho English lived in
\lhc north-east part, where \Vill Atkins and his comrades
began, and came on southward and south-west, towards the
hack part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great
addition of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that
they need not jostle one another for want of room. All the
east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any of
the savages should come on shore there only for their usual
customary barbaritics, they might come and go; if they
distin'bed nobody, nobody would disturb them: and no doubt
but they were often ashore, and went away again; for I
never heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed
any more.

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my
friend the clergyman that the work of converting the $11.ng
might perhaps he set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction,
and I told him that now I thought that it was put in a fair
way; for the savages, being thus divided among the Christians,
if they would but every one of them do their part with those
which came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very
good eil'ect.

He agreed presently in that, if they did their palt. " But
how," says he, "shall we obtain that of them'l " I told him
we would call them all together, and leave it in charge with
them, or go to' them, one by one, which he thought best; so
we divided it,--he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all
Papists, and I to speak to the English, who were all Pro-
testants; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and
made them promise that they would never make any distinc~

'tion of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to
turn Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of the
true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they like-
wise promised us that they would never have any difiei'ences
or disputes one with another about religion

When I cameto Will Atkins's house, I found there the
young woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife.
were become intimates; and this prudent, religion; young

woman had perfected the work \Vill Atkins had begun; and
though it was not abovo four days after what I have related,
yet the now--baptized savage woman was made such a Christian
as I have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversa-
tion in the world. It came next into my mind in the morning
boforo I wont to them, that amongst all the needful things I
had to leiwe with tlu'lu, I had not left them a Bible, in which
I showed myself less considering for them than my good
friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of
a hundred pounds from Lisbon. where she packed up three
Bibles and a Prayelubook. However, the good woman's
charity had a grvatcr extent than ever she imagined, for they
were reserved for the comfort and instruction of those that
made much better use of them than I had done.

1 took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to
Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and
Atkins's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together
--for \Vill Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy--1 asked
if they were together now, and he said, Yes ; so I wont into
the house, and he with me, and we found them together very
earnest in discourse. "0h, sir," says Will Atkins, " when
God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring
home, he never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new
instructor: I knew I was unworthy as I was incapable of that
work; that young woman has been sent hither from heaven,
----she is enough to convert a whole island of savages." The
young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired
her to sit- still ; I told her she had agood werk upon her hands,
and I hoped God would bless her in it.

\ we talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any
'book among them, though I did not ask ; but I put my hand
into my pocket, and pulled out my Bible; " Here," said I to
Atkins, "I have brought you an assistant that perhaps you
had not before." The man was so confounded that he was
not able to speak for some time; but. recovering himself, he
takes it with bot-h his hands, and turning to his wife, " Here,
my dear," says he " did not I tell you our God, though he lives
above. could hear what we have said? Here's the book I
prayvd for when you and I kneeled down under the bush ;
now God has heard us, and sent it." When he had said so,
the man fell into such passionate transports, that between the
joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran
down his face like a child that was crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a
mistake that none of us were aware of: for she firmly believed

Bod had sent the book upon her husband's petition. It i
true that providentinlly it was so, and might be taken so in a.
Consequevt sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult
mattor at that tixno to have persuaded the poor woman to have
'n-liovod that an express messenger canto from Honvon on
purposo to bring that individual book. But it was too serious
a matter to sul'iur any (lolnsion to take place, so 1 turned to
tho young woman, and told hor wo did not desire to im-
poso upon tho ln'w ounrvrt in her first and more igno'ant

that Hod may ho wry proporly said to answer our petitions,

and doslm'atvly wicked. yet this man is n. standing rule to us

tho force of their education returns upon them, and tho early
instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have been
many yours laid asleep, but some time or other they may find
tho lwnolit of it. Thus it was with this poor man : however
ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he found
ho had some to do with now more ignorant than himself, and
that the least part of the instruction of his good father that
now came to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest. it Occurred to him, he said, how his father
used to insist so much on the incxprossible value of the Bible.
and the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and
persons; lint he never entertained the least notion of the
worth of it till now, when being to talk to henthens,
savages. and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written
oracle for his assistance. The young woman was glad of it
also for the present occasion, though she had one, and so had
the youth, on board our ship among their goods, which were
not yet brought on shore. And now, having said so many
things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story
more of her and myself, which has something in it very
instructive and remarkable.

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman
was reduced ; how her mistress was starved to death, and died
on board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole

ship's company was reduced to the last extremity. The gentle- ~-

woumn, and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to
pro visions, and at last total] y neglected and starved,-----that is to
my, brought to the last extremity of hunger. One day, being
discoursing with her on the extremities they suffered, I asked
her if she could describe, by what she had felt, what it was to
starve, and how it appeared? She said she believed she could,
and told her title very distinctly thus :--

" First, we had for some days fared exceedingly hard, and
suffered very great hunger; but at last we were wholly
without food of any kind, except sugar, and a little wine and
water. The first day after I had received no food at all, I
found myself, towards evening, empty and sick at the stomach,
and nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I lay
down on the couch in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about
three hours. and awakcd a. little refreshed, having taken a
glass of wine when I lay down ; after being about three hours
awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stonuwh sickish, and lay down again,
but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill ; and thus I
continued all the second day with a strange variety,---iirst
hungry, then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second
night, being obliged to go to bed again without any food, more

than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed L

was at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked
with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and
went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach was full
after this, as it would have been after a good dinner; but
when I awaited, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find
myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of wine we
had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its having some
spirit to supply nourishment; but there being no substance in
the stomach for the digesting office to work upon, I found the
only olioct of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from
the stomach into the head ; and I lay, as they told me, stupid
and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third day, in
tho morning, after a night of strange, confused, and incon-
-sisi-cnt dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked
ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not
my understanding returned and conquered it, whether, if I
had been a mother, and had had a little child with me, its life
would have been safe or not. This lasted about three hours,
during which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can now
inform you.

" In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down
and struck my face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which
my mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed out of
my nose ; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat
down and bled into it a great deal; and as the blood came
from me, I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or
fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous port of the
hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit, but could
not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I
had bled some time I swooned, and they all believed I was
dead ; but I came to myself soon after, and then had a most
dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described--not like the
colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for food; and towards night
it wont oil' with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food.
I took another draught of water with sugar in it ; but my
stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again; then
I tool: a draught of water without sugar, and that stayed wit):
me ; and I laid me down upon the bed, pmying most heartily
that it would please God to take me away; and composing my
mind in hopes of it, I slumbered a while, and then waking,
thought myself dying, being light with vapours from an
empty stomach. I recommended my soul then to God, and
then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into
the sea.

" All this while mv mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,

.o

expiring, but she bore it with much more patience than I, and
(mm the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young
master, who would not have taken it, hot she obliged him to
eat it; and I believe it saved his life. Towards the morning
I slept again ; and when I awoke I fell into a violent passion
of crying, and after that had a second fit of violent hunger.
I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition; and once
or twice I was going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the
basin in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day
before: I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and
such a. greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it
before and afraid it should be taken from me now. After it
was down, though the thoughts of it filled me horror, yet it
checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draught of
water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours after.
This was the fourth day ; and thus I kept up till towards
night, when, within the compass of three hours, I had all
the several circumstances over again, one after another, viz.
sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then
ravenous again, then sick, then lunatic, then crying, then
ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour, and my
strength wasted exceedingly; at night I lay me down, having
no comfort but in the hope that I should die before
morning.

"All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping,
by wind, instead of food having found its way into the bowels ;
and in this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised by
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who called out _
to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little
for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead,
though she was able to give very little signs of life. I had
then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some sus--
tenance, as I cannot describe; with such frequent throes and
pangs of appetite, as nothing but the tortures of death can,
imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen '
above cry out, ' A sail ! a sail! 'and halloo and jump about as
if they were distracted. I was not able to get oil from the
bed, and my mistress much less; and my young master was so
sick, that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open
the cabin door, or get any account what it was that Occasioned
such confusion; nor had we had any conversation with the ship's
company for two days, they having told us that they had not458 urn AND Anvmunns or nosmsou causes.

a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; and this they told
us afterwards,--they thought we had been dead. It was this
dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our
lives; and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and
better too."

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was ex~
coeding instructive to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to
be a true account, because the youth gave me an account of a
good part of it; though I must own, not so distinct and so
feeling as the maid; and the rather, because it seems his
mother fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor
maid, whose constitution was stronger than that of her
lnistl'oss, who was in years, and a weakly woman too, might
struggle harder with it ; nevertheless, she might be supposed
to fool the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who
might be allowed to keep the last bit something longer than
she parted with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the
case is here related. if our ship, or some other, had not so
pro'videntially met them, but a few days more would have
ended all their lives. I now return to my disposition of things
among the people. And, first, it is to be observed here, that
for many reasons I did not think fit to let them know anything
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of setting up
among them; for I found, at least at my first coming, such
seeds of division among them, that I saw plainly, had I set
up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon every
light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one another;
or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the island a den
of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and religious

maple, as I intended it; nor did I leave the two pieces of
hrass mnnon that I had on board, or the extra two quarter-
deck guns that my nephew had provided, for the same reason.
I thought it was enough to qualify them for a. defensive war
against any that should invade them, but not to set them up
for an ofiensive war, or to go abroad to attack others ; which,
in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon them.
I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service
another way, as I shall observe in its place.

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good
circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on

 

_ .~ , ...s>>i.~UIIUSUE HIDE A LAST FAnKWZLL TU TI"; {SUNS}.
board my ship again on the 6th of May, having been about
twenty~tive days among them: and as they were all resolved
to stay upon the island till I came to remove them, I promised
to send them further relief from the Brazils, if I could
possibly find an opportunity. I particularly promised to send
them some cattle such as sheep, hogs, and cows: as to the two
cows and calves which I brought from England, we had been
obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for
want of hay to feed them.

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the
Brazils in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable
in our passage but this: that about three days after we had
sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the
E.N.E., running, as it were, into a bay, or gulf on the land
side, we were driven something out of our course, and once or
twice our men cried out, "Land to the eastward!" but
whether it was the continent or islands we could not tell by
any means. But the third day, towards evening. the sea
smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered towards the land with something very black; not
being able to discover what it was, till after some time, our
chief mate, going up the main shrouds a little way, and
looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was an army.
I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and thwarted
him a little hastily. " Nay, sir," says he, " don't be angry,
for 'tis an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are a

thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along, for they
are coming towards us space."

I was a little surprised then indeed, and so was my nephew, V

the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it, but said. two or three times,
we should all be devoured. I must confess, considering we
were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore,
I liked it the worst; however, I bade them not be afraid, but

bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to'

know that we must engage them The weather continued calm,
and they came on space towards us, so I gave orders to come to
ananchor, and furl all. our sails ; as for the savages, I told them
they had nothing to fear but fire, and therefore they should
get their boats out, and fusion them, one close by the head.
and the other by the stern, and man them both well, and wait
the issue in that posture: this I did, that the men in the boats
might be ready with sheets and buckets to put out any the
these savages might endeavour to fix to the outside of the
ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they emno up with us ; but never was such a horrid sight seen
by ('hristians: though my mate 'ns much mistaken in his
ealenlation of their number, yet when they came up no
reekoned about a hundred and twenty-six canoes; some of
them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some mot",
and the least six or seven. When they came nearer to us,
they seemed to be. struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a
sight which doubtless they had never seen before; nor could
they at first, as we afterwards understood, know what to
make of us; they rune boldly up, however, very near to us,
and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our
men in the boats not to let them come too near them. This
very order brought us to an engagement with them, without
our designing it; for live or six of the large canoes came so
near our long-boat. that our men beckoned with their hands to
keep them bark, which they understood very well, and went
lmek: but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us
from these boats. and one of our men in the long boat was
very much wounded. However, 1 called to them not to fire by
any means: but we handed down some deal boards into the
boat. and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like
waste boards. to cover them from the arrows of the savages,
if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern what :
they were, though we could not tell their: design; and Ieasily '
found they wero some 01' my old friends. the same sort of
savages that I had been used to engage with. In a. short
time more they rowed a little further out to sea, till they
rame directly broadside with us, and then rowed down
straight upon us. till they came so near that they could hear
us speak; upon this i ordered all my men to keep close, lest
they should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns
ready: but being so near as to be within hearing, I made
Friday go out upon the dock, and call out aloud to them in
his language, to know what they meant. Whether they
understood him or not, that I knew not ; but as soon as he
had called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or
nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping
down, showed us their naked backs; whether this was a
defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in
mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately'
Friday cried out they wore gwing to shoot, and, unhappily for
him, poor fellow, they let lly about three hundred of their
arrows, and, to my inexpressihle grief, killed poor Friday, no
other man being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell
very near him ; such unlucky marksmen they were I

I was so annoyed at the loss of my old trusty servant and
companion. that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a
broadside as they had never heard in their lives before.
They were not above half a cable's length off when we fired;
and our gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of
their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one
shot only. The ill manners of turning up their bare backs to
us gave us no great offence; neither did I know for certain
whether that which would pass for the greatest contempt
among us might be understood so by them or not; therefore,
in return, I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns
at them with powder only, which I knew would frighten then
sufficiently: but when they shot at us directly with all the
fury they were capable of, and especially as they had killed
my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and
who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought myself not only
justifiable before God and man, but would have been very
glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and drowned
every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we
wounded at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry
never were seen among such a multitude; there were thirteen
or fourteen of their canoes split and oven-set in all, and the men
all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits,
scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little care to'
save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot;464 mm: A.>> .ibwzmmms

so I suppose that many of them were lost; and our men
took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above an hour
after they were all gone. The small shot from our cannon
must needs kill and wound a great many; but, in short, we
never knew how it went with them, for they fled so fast, that
in three hours or thereabouts. we could not see above three or
four straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest anymore;
for a breeze of wind springing up tho same evening, we
weighed, and set sail for the llrazils.

We had a prisoner. indeed, but the creature was so sullen
that he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he
would starve himself to death. But I took a way to cure
him: for I made them take him and turn him into the long-
boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the see
again, and so leave him where they found him, if he would
not speak; nor would that do, but they really did throw him
into the sea. and came away from him. Then he followed
them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his
tongue. though they knew not one word of what he said;
however at last they took him in again. and then he began to
he more tractable: nor did 1 ever design they should drown
him.

\Ve were new under sail again, but I was the most dis-
consolate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and
would have been very glad to have gone back to the island,
to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion,
but it could not be: so we went on. "'0 had one prisoner,
as l have said. and it was along time before we could make
him understand anything; but, in time, our men taught him
some English. and he began to be a little tractable. After-
wards, we inquired what country he came from; but could
make nothing of what he said; for his speech was so odd, all
gutturals. and he spoke in the threat in such a hollow, odd
manner. that we could never form a word after him ; and we
were all of opinion that they might speak that language as
well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we perceive
that they had any ocmsion either for teeth. tongue, lips, or
palate. but formed their words just as a hunting-horn forms a
tune with an open throat. He told us, however, some time after,
when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they
were going with their kings to fight a street battle. When he
said kings, we asked him how many kings! He said they
Were live nation (we could not make him understand the
plural x), and that they all joined to go against two nation. We
asked him what made them come up to us? He said, "To
main-e to great wonder look." Here it is to be observed, that
all these natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
English, always add two c's at the end of the words where we
use one; and they place the accent upon them, no makde,
titklie, and the like; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave
it ofi', though at last he did.

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take
my last leave of him. Peer honest Friday! We buried him
with all the decency and eolemnity passible, by putting him
into a collin, and throwing him into the sea; and I caused
them to lire eleven guns for him. So ended the life of the
most grateful, faithful, honest, and most ailectionate servant
that ever man had.

"'9 went new away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in
about twelve days' time we made land, in the latitude of five
degrees south of the line, being the north-easternmost land of
all that part of America. We kept on S. by E , in sight of
the shore four days, when we made Cape 5t. Augustine, and
in three days came to an anchor ofi the Bay of All Saints, the
old place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good
and evil fate. Never ship came to this port that had less
business than I had, and yet it was with great diliieulty that
we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on shore:
not my partner himself, who was alive, and made a great
figure among them, not my two merchant-trustees, not the
hune of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain
me that favour. My partner, however, remembering that I
had given five hundred moidores to the Prior of the Monastery
of the Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monaster , and obliged the prior that then
was to go to the governor, and get leave for me personally,
with the (:mein and one more, besides eight seamen, to come
on shore, and no more; and this upon condition, absolutely
capitulnted for, that we should not ell'er to land any goods
out of the ship, or to carry any person away without licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods, that it
was with extreme difiiculty that I got on shore three bales of

G o
English goods, such as fine broadclothe, studs, and some linen,
lvhich I had brought for a present to my partner.

lie was a very generous, open-hearted man; although he
began, like me, with little at first. Though he knew not that
I haul the least design of giving him anything, he sent me on
board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats,
worth about thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three
or four fine medals of gold : but I was even with him in my
present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine broadcloth,
English stuffs, lace, and fine hollnnd; also, I delivered him
about the value of one hundred pounds sterling, in the some
goods, for other uses; and I obliged him to set up the sloop,
which I had brought with Inc from England, as l have said,
for the use of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I
intended to my plantation.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very
few days, for she was already framed ; and I gave the master
of her such instructions that he could not miss the place; nor
did he, as I had an acrount from my partner afterwards. I
got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them; and
one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there,
oll'cred to go with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter to
tho governor Spaniard. to allot him a sufficient quantity of
lnml for a plantation, and on my giving him some clothes and
tools for his planting work, which he said he understood,
having been an old planter at Maryland, and a bumncer into
the. bargain. 1 encouraged the fellow by granting all he
desired ; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom wr
had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the
governor Spaniard to give him his share of everything he
wanted with the rust.

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told u e

how was a certain very honest follow, :1. Brazil planter of his
acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of the
church. '* I know not what the matter is with him," says he,
" but, on my conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart,
and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the
Inquisition." He then told me that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two
daughters; and if I would let them go to my island, and allot
them a plantation, he would give them a. small stock to begin
with,--for the officers of the Inquisition had seized all his
effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a little house-
hold stufi, and two slaves; "and," adds be, "though I hate
his principles, yet I would not have him fall into their hands,
for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does." I granted this
presently, and joined my Englishman with them: and we con-
cealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our
ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea ; and then having put
all their goods on board some time before, we put them on
board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. Our seamen
was mightily pleased with this new partner ; and their stocks,
indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and a
farm,--but nothing to begin with, except as above : however,
they carried over with them, what was worth all the rest,
some materials for planting sugar'canes, with some plants
of planes, which he, I mean the Brazil planter, understood very
we .

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the
island, I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and live
calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows, two
mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my
promise, I engaged three Brazil women to go, and recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could have procured more women, but I remembered that the
poor persecuted man had two daughters, and that there were
but five of the Spaniards that wanted partners,----the rest had
wives of their own, though in another country. All this
cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very
welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addi-
tion, between sixty and seventy people, besides little children,

'of which there were a great many. I found letters at
London from them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back
to England.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of dis-
course about it: and whoever reads the rest of my memoran
dums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it,
and expect to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by
his own harms, much less by those of other men, to beware ,-
not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and disappoint-
ments,--not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, nor
mode cautious by afflictions and distress beyond example.

0 G
I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man
at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire
him to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve
him. Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone
directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I did the other
vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my
people ; taken a patent from the government here to have
secured my property, in subjection only to that of England;
had I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants and
people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified and
strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with
people. as 1 might easily have done ; had I then settled myself
there. and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might
also have done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to
have fitted her out again for our supply,--had I done this, and
stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a. man of com-
mon sense. But 1 was possessed of a wandering spirit, and
scorned all advantages : 1 pleased myself with being the patron
of the people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, pro-
viding for them as if I had been father of the whole family,
as well as of the plantation. But I never so much as pretended
to plant in the name of any government or nation, or to
acknowledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to any
one nation more than another: nay, I never so much as gave
the place a name, but left it as I found it, belonging to
nobody, and the people under no discipline or government but
my own; who, though I had influence over them as a father
and benefactor, had no authority or power to act or command
one way or other, further than voluntary consent moved them
to comply. Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have
done well enough; but as I rambled from them, and came
there no more. the last letters I had from any of them were
by my partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop to
the place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter
till I got to London, several years after it was written, that
they went on but poorly, were discontent with their long stay
thorn: that "'ill Atkins was death--that five of the Spaniards
were come. away--and though they had not been much mo-
lested by tho savages, yet they had had so skirmishes with
them _: and that they beaged of him to wme to ine to think
of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that they
might see their country again before they died.

But I was gone a wildgoose chase, indeed I and they that
will have any more of me, must be content to follow me into a
new variety of follies, hardships and wild adventures, wherein
the justice of Providence may be duly observed; and we may i
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires,
make the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish
us most severely with those very things which we think it '
would be our utmost happiness to be allowed to possess.
Whether I had business or no business, away I went: it is
no time now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my
own conduct, but to come to the history,--I was embarked
for the voyage, and the voyage I went. .

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest Popish
clergyman,--for let their opinion of us, and all other heretics
in general, as they call us, be as uncheritable as it may, I
verily believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good
of all men: yet I believe he used reserve in many of his ex-
pressions, to prevent giving me ofienee; for I scarce heard
him once call on the Blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago, or
his guardian angel, though so common with the rest of them.
However, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sincerity and
pious intentions: and I am firmly of opinion, if the rest of
the Popish missionaries were like him, they would strive to
visit even the poor Tertars and Laplanders, where they have
nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to India, Persia,
China, &c., the most wealthy of the heathen countries; for if
they expected to bring no gains to their church by it, it may _
well be admired how they came to admit the Chinese Confucius-
into the calendar of the Christian saints. '

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest
asked me leave to go thither; being still, as he observed,'
bound never to finish any voyage he began. How happy it'
had been for me if I had gone with him I But it was too late
now: all things Heaven appoints for the best: had I gene
with him, I had never had so. many things to be thankful for,
and the reader had never heard of the second part of the
travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe: so I must here
leave exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. From
the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the
Cape of Good Hope, and Chad 0. tolerably good voyage, our
courso generally south-east, now and then a storm, and some
contrary winds; but my disasters at sea were at an end,----- my
fut-urn rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore, that
it might appear the land was as well prepared to be our
.scourgn as the spa.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a snpcrcargo on

, board, who was to dirnct all her motions after she arrived at

' lhn "'1'"- only being limitrd to a cortain number of days for

' stay. by cliai'ior-p:ii'ty, at the several ports she was to go to.
This was none of my business. neither did I meddle with it:
my m-phew, the captain, and the supormrgo, adjusting all
those things hutwoon them as they thought lit. "'0 stayed at
tho ('upo no longer than was needful to take in fresh water,
but made the best of our way for the coast of Coromandrl.
"'0 were, indood, informed that a French man-of'war, of fifty
guns, and two large morchant ships, were gone for the Indies ;
and us I know wo were at war with France, I had some appro'
honsions of them ; but they went their own way, and we heard
on more of them.

I shall not. pester tho reader with a tedious description of

plan-s. journals of our voyages, variations of the compass,
latilndos, trade-winds, &c.; it is enough to name the ports
and places which wo touched at, and what occurred to us upon
our passago from one to another. 'Vo touched first at the
island of Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and

"'0 worn obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnishod ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always
too curious to look into ovary nook of the world wherever I
came, went on shore as often as I could. It was on the em!
side of the island that we went on shore one evening: and tho
pooplo, who, by tho way, are very numerous, come thronging
about us, and st-mvd gazing at us at a distance. As we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger ; but when we saw the people, we out
three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us ; which, it seems, is a. mark in that country, not only
of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other
side set up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the truce too; but then this is a. known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards
them, nor they to come past your three poles, or boughs,
towards you; so that you are perfectly secure within the three
poles, and all the Space between your poles and theirs is
allowed like a market for free converse, traffic, and commerce;
When you go there, you must not mrry your weapons with'
you; and if they come into that space, they stick up their
javolins and lances all atthe first poles, and come on unarmed;
but if any violence is ofi'ered them, and the truce thereby
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their
weapons, and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all
very friendly and civil; and they brought several kinds of
provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had; the women also brought us milk and roots, and several
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made
us a little tent or hut of some bonghs or trees, and lay on
shore all night. I know not what was the occasion, but I was
not so Well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest 3 and the boat
riding at an anchor at about a stone's cast from the land, with
two men in her to take care of her, I made one of them come
on shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in
\the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay
under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our men
make a. terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake
to bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they won'-
all like to be murdered ; at the same time, I heard the fire of
five muskets, which was the number of guns they had, and
that three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not
so easily frightened with guns as the savages were in America,
where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the
noise, I caused the boat to he thrust in, and resolved, with472 urn AND ant-amount:

"71.! got tho bout soon to tho shoro, but our men were in too much
hustr; for bring come to the shore, they plunged into tho
water, to got to the bout with all the expedition they could,
being pul'suml by lu-twoon three and four hundred men. Our
men were but ninu in all. and only lin- of thmn haul fuxces
fwith them ; tho rest hzul pistols and swords, indeed, but they
woro \f small usv to them.

"'0 took up seven of our men, and with ditliculty enough

' too, throo of thrm being very ill wounded; and that which
was still worse was, that whilo we stood in tho bout to take
our men in, we woro in as much danger as they were in on
shoro ; for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick that
we wore glad to barricndo tho side of thobout up with tho
benches. and two or threo loose bourds, which, to our grout
satisfaction. wo had by more accident in the boat. And yet,
had it boon daylight, they are, it seems, such exact mm'ksmen,
that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us,
they would have bven sure of us. We had, by the light of tho'
moon, :1 little sight of them, as they stood polting us from tho
shore with darts and arrows; and having got roudy our fire-
arms, we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by tho cries
of snmo of them, had wounded several; however, they stood
thus in battlo array on the shore till break of day, which wo
supposed was that they might see the better to take their aim
at us.

In this condition wo lay, and could not tell how to weigh
our anchor, or sot up our suil, boatuse we must needs stand up
in the boat, and they were me sure to hit us as we were to hit
a. bird in n tree with small shot. We made signals of dis--
tress to tho sllip, and, though she rode a league ofi, yet my
nephew, the captain. hearing our firing, and by glassm perceiv'
ing the posture wo lay in, and that we fired towards tho shore.
pretty well understood us ; and weighing anchor with all
spood. ho stood as near the shore as ho durst with tho ship,
and then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist
us. \Ve called to them not to come too near, telling them what
condition wo were in : however, they stood in near to us. and
one of the men taking the. end of n. towdino in his hand,
and keeping one bout between him and the'enemy, so that
they could not yu-fectly see him, swam on board us, and made
fast the line to the bout ; upon which we slipped out a little
cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of
reach of the arrows; we all the while lying close behind the
barricade we had made. As soon as we were got from between
the ship and the shore, that we could lay her side to the shore, she
ram along just by them, and poured in u broadside among them.
loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stall};
besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among them. '

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had
time to examine into the occasion of this fray ; and, indeed,
our supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me
upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to it. At length, it came out that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brought
it within our poles, and a. young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs; and while the old woman
(whether she was mother to the young woman or no they
could not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men offered
some rudeness to the girl that was with her, at which the old
women made a great noise: however, the seamen would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old women's sight
among the trees, it being almost dark; the old women went
away without her, and, as we may suppose, mode an outcry among
the people she came from ; who, upon notice, raised that great
my upon us in three or four hours, and it was great odds
but we had all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a. lance thrown at him just
at the beginning of the attack, as he sollied out of the tent
they had made; the test came off free, all but the fellow who
was the occasion of all the mischief. who paid dear enough for his
brutality, for we could not hear what became of him for a
great while. We luy upon the shore two days after, though
the wind presented, and mode signals for him, and made our
boat sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain;
so we were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had
suffered for it, the loss had been less. I could not satisfy
myself however, without venturing on shore once more, to try
if I could learn anything of him or them: it was the third
night after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I
could by any means, what mischief we had done, and how the

game stood on tho lndiuns' side. I was careful to do it in
the dark, least, we. should be attacked again: but I ought,
indeed. to have been sure that the men I wont. with haul been
under my command. before 1 engaged in a thing so hazardous
and mischievous as l was brought into by it, without design.

"We took twenty as stout- fellows wit-h us as any in the ship,
besides the sulmrcargo and myself, and we landed two hours
before midnight, at- (hc same. place where the Indians stood
drawn up in the evening before. I landed heic, because my
design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted
the field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them 5 and I thought if we could sur-
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might, get our man
again, by way of exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two
bodies whereof the bontswain commanded one, and I the other.
\Ve neither saw nor hoard anybody st-ir when we landed : and
we marched up, one body at a. distance from the other, to the
place. At first we could see Lothiug, it being very dark ; till
by and by our bootswain, who led the first party, stumbled
and fell over a dead body. This made them halt awhile ; for
knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up
there. ""0 concluded to halt till the moon began to rise.
which we know would be in less than an hour, when we could
easily discern the havoc we had made among them. we told
thirty-two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite
dead ; some had an arm, and some a. leg shot off, and one his
head ; those that were wounded, we supposed, they had carried
away. W hen we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of
all we could come to the knowledge of, I resolved on going on
board; but. the boatswoin and his party sent me word that
they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go
along with them; and if they could find them, as they still
fancied they should, they did not doubt of getting a. good
booty; and it might be they might find Tom Jeffry there:
that was the man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I know well enough
what answer to have given them; for I should have oom-
manded them instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard
fit for us to run, who had a ship and ship-loading in our
charge. and a voyage to make which depended very much
upnn the lives of the men; but as they sent me word they'
were resolved to go, and only asked me and my company to
go 9'an with them, I positively refused it, and rose up, for I
was sit-Ling on the ground, in order to go to the boat. One or
tWo of the men began to importune me to go; and when I

 

Was--"y

refused, began to grumble, and say they were not under my
command, and they would go. " Come, J ack," says one of the
men, " will you go with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he
would,---and then women--and, in a word, they all left me
but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a. boy left in the boat.
So the supercergo and I, with the third man, went back to the
beet, where we told them we would stay for them, and take
care to_tnke in as many of them as should be left ; for I told
them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed
most of them would have the fate of Tom J eil'ry.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, d'c. ; so away
they went. I untreated them to consider the ship and the
voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they
were intrustod with the voyage, in some measure; that if they
miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and

Ithat they could not answerfor it to God or man. But I might

as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship: they were
mad upon their journey; only they gave me good words, and
begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for
the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile 03,
though they found it above two miles before they got to it.

Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as
warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had
every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and
the boatswain and two more had poleaxes ; besides all which
they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes. Bolder
fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked
work in the world. When they went out, their chief design
was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold
there ; but a circumstance which none of them were aware of
set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all.

When they came to the few Indian houses which they
thought had been the town, which was not above half a mile
off, they were under great disappointment, for there were not
above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the town was, or
how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore, what to
do, and were some time before they could resolve ; for if they
fell upon these, they must cut all their throats; and it was
ten to one but some of them might escape, it being in the
night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would
run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army
upon them; on the other hand, if they went away and left
those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not
tell which way to look for the town: however, the last was
the best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for
the town as well as they could. They went on a little way,
and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded,
would be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow
certainly belonged to the town before them, or the town
behind them, and if they untied her, they should see which
way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to.
her; but if she went forward, they would follow her. So they
cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow
went on before them, directly to the town; which, as they
reported, consisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and
in some of these they found several families living together.

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep
could make them: and, first, they called another council, to
consider what they had to do; and presently resolved to
divide themselves into three bodies, and so set three houses
on fire in three parts of the town ; and as the men came out,
to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not
be asked what to do then), end so to search the rest of the
houses for plunder : but they resolved to march silently first
through the town, and see what dimensions it was of, and if
they might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them: but while they were animating one
another to the work, three of them, who were a little before
the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them that they
had found Tom Jefiry: they all ran up to the place, where
they found the poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and
his throat out. There was an Indian house just by the tree,
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with us before
and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and our
men found they were awake, and talking one to another in.
that house, but knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them,
as before, that they swore to one another that they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian that came into their hands
should have any quarter; and to work they' went immedi-
Moly, and yet not so madly as might be expected from the
rage and fury they were in. Their first care was to get some-
thing that would soon take fire, but, after a little search, they
found that would be to no purpose; for most of the houses
were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the
country is full 3 so they presently made some wildfire, us we
call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands,
and in a. quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four
or five places, and particularly that house where the Indians
were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened
creatures began to rush out to save their lives, but met with
their fate in the attempt; and especially at the door, where
they drove them back, the boatswoin himself killing one or
two with his poleaxe. The house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called for a. hand grenade, and
threw it among them, which at first frightened them, but,
when it burst, made such havoc among them that they cried
out in a. hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who
were in the open port of the house were killed or hurt with
the grenade, except two or three more who pressed to the
door, which the bontswnin and two more kept, with their
beyonets on the mnzzles of their pieces, and desputrhed all
that came in their way ; but there was another uiuirtment in
the house, where the prince or king, or whatever he was, and
several others, were; and these were kept in till the house,
which was by this time all in n light flame, fell in upon them,
and they were smothered together.

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not
waken the people faster then they could master them; but the
fire began to woken them fast enough, and our fellows were
glad to keep a. little together in bodies; for the fire grew so
raging, all the houses being made of light combustible stn'el',
that they could hardly hear the street between them. Their
business was to follow the fire, for the enter execution : as fast '
as the tire either forced the people out of those houses which
were burning. or frightened them out of others, our people.
were ready at their doors to knock them on the hood. still
calling and hallouing one to another to remember Tom Jellry.

While this was doing, I. must confess I was very uneasy.
and especially when I saw the ilmnes of the town, which. it
being night, seemed to be close by me. My nephew, the
captain, who was roused by his men, seeing;r such a lire, was
very uneasy, not knowing what the matter was, or what
danger I was in, especially hearing the guns too, for by this
time they began to use their fire-arms; a thousand thoughts
oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo, what
would become of us; and at last, though he could ill spare any
more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be in, he
took another host, and with thirteen men and himself came
ashore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the snpercargo in the boat
vith no more than two men ; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to kno'"
what was doing ; for the noise continued, and the Ham.)
increased; in short, it was next to an impossibility for any
men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had
happened, or their concern for the safety of the men: in a
word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, let
what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with
the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the
interest of the owners and merchants, rim. and told him land
the two men would go, and only see if we could at a distance
learn what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell
him. It was in vain to tell: to my nephew, as it was to talk
to the rest before; he would go it, he said ; and he only wished
he had only left but ten men in the ship. for he could not
think of having his men lost for want of help : he had rather
lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all; and away he
went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to
persuade them not to go; so the captain ordered two men to
row hack the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the
long boat at an anchor; and that, when they came back, six
men should keep the two boats, and six more come site;
us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for thr
whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof tw; i
were lost in the late quarrel which brought this mischief or.

Being now on the march, we felt little of the ground we
trod on; and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but
went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the
guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people
were now quite of another nature, and filled us with horror.
I must confess I was never at the sacking a city, or at the
taking a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver CromWell
taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and
child; and I had read of Count Tilly sucking the city of
Magdeburg, and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand,
of all sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing itself
before, nor is it possible to describe it, or tho horror that was
upon our minds at hearing it. However, we went on, and at
length came to the town, though there was no entering ihel
streets of it for the fire. The first object we met with was
the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the
house was consumed; and just before it plainly now to be
seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three women,
killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the heap
among the tire ; in short, there were such instances of rge,
altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what
was human, that we thought it impossible our men could be
guilty of it; or, if they were the authors of it, we thought
they ought to be every one of them put to the worst of deaths.
But this was not all : we saw the fire increased forward, and
the cry went on just as the fire went on ; so that we were in
the utmost confusion. "We advanced a little way further, and
behold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and cryingin
a most dreadful manner, came flying as if they had wings, and
after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same
terror and consternation, with three of our English butchers
in the rear, who. when they could not overtake them, fired in
among them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down
in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their
enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that
pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially
the women ; and two of them fell down, as if already dead,
with the fright. .
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in
my veins, when I saw this; and, I believe, had the three
English sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our
men kill them all; however, we took some means to let the
poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them; and
immediately they came up to us, and kneeling down,-with their!
hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save them,
which we let thou: know we would ; whereupon they crept all
together in a huddle close behind us, as for protection. I left
my men drawn up together, and, charging them to hurt nobody,
but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and see what
devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to do, and
to command them off; assuring them that if they stayed till
daylight they would have a hundred thousand men about their'
ears: I say I left them, and went among those flying people,
taking only two of our men with me ; and there was, indeed,
a piteous spectacle among them. Some of them had their feet
terribly burned with trampling and running through the fire;
others their hands burned ; one of the women had fallen downi
in the fire, and was very much burned before she could get out'
again ; and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs
and thighs, from our men pursuing; and another was shot
through the body, and died while I was there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was;
but I could not understand one word they said; though, by
signs, I perceived some of them know not what was the
occasion themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this
outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back
to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the
town, through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and
put an end to it, cost what it would ; accordingly, as I came
back to my men, I told them my resolution, and commended
them to follow me, when, at the very moment, came four of
our men, with the hoatswain at their head, roving over heaps
of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as
if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men
hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo ; and with much
ado one of them made them hear, so that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.

As soon as the boatswaiu saw us, he set up a halloo like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come;
and, without waiting to hear me, "Captain," says he, " nob]
captain! I am glad you are come; we have not half done yet.

I Villanons, hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor,
Tom has hairs upon his head : we have sworn to spare none of]
them ; we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth , "
and thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word. At last, raising my voice,
that I might silence him a little, "Barbarous dog l" said I,
"what are you doing? I won't have one creature touched
mom, upon pain of death: I charge you. upon your life, to .

n .u
stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a. dead man
this minute."--"Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you.
do, or what they have done? If you want a. reason for what
we have done, come hither ; " and with that he showed me the
poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut.

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time
would have been forward enough; but I thought they had

\mrried their rage too far, and remembered Jacob's words to >>
[his sons Simeon and Levi : " Cursed be their anger, for it was
home; and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I had new a
'new task upon my hands ; for when the men I carried with me
saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restmin
them as I should have had with the others; nay, my nephew
himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that
he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered;
and as to the people, he thought not one of them ought to live;
for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the
poor man, and that they ought to be used like murderers.
Upon these words, away ran eight of my men, with the boat--
swnin and his crew, to complete their bloody work; and I,
seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, much less the
horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into
their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercm'go and
two men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was u
very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as
it were alone ; for as it began now to be almost day, and the
alarm had run over the country, there stood about forty men
armed with lu-nces and bows, at the little place where the
twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by:
accident I missed the place, and came directly to the sea-side":
and by the time I got to the sea-side, it was broad day : imme~
diately I took the pimmce and went on board, and sent her
back to assist the max in what might happen. I observed,
about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the fire was
pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about half an
hour after I got on board, I heard a volley of our men's five-
arms, and saw a. great smoke. This, as I understood afterwards,
was our men falling upon the men, who, as I said, stood at the
few houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seven-
teen, and set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with
the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came dropping in,
not in two bodies as they went, but straggling here and there
in such a manner, that a small force of resolute men might
have cut them all 0E. But the dread of them was upon the
whole country; and the men were surprised, and so frightened.
that I believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight
of but five of our men. Nor in all this terrible action was,
there a man that made any considerable defence : they were
so surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden
attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not which way
to turn themselves; for if they fled one way they were met
by one party, if back again, by another : so that they were
everywhere knocked down; nor did any of our men receive
the lust hurt, except one that sprained his foot, and another
that had one of his hands burned.

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed,
with all the men. but with him in particular,'as well for his
acting so out of his duty, as commander of the ship, and
having the charge of the voyage upon him. as in his prompting,
rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men, in so bloody
and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very
respectfully, but told me that when he saw the body of the
poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel and bar-
barous a. manner, he was not master of himself, neither could
he govern his passion ; he owned he should not have done so,
as he was commander of the ship; but as he was a man, and
nature moved him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of
the men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew
it well enough; so they took no notice of my dislike. The
next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it. Om,
men difiered in the account of the number they had killed;
but according to the best of their accounts, put all together,
they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty people,
men, women, and children, and left not a. house standing in
the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite
deed (for his threat was so cut that his head was half off), it
would do him no service to bring him away ; so they only took
him down from the tree, where he was hanging'by one2 hand.

' n n
However just our men thought this action, I was against
them in it, and I always, offer that time, told them God would
blast the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed
that night to be murder in them For though it is true that
they had killed 'l'om Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had
broken the truce, and had ill-used a young woman of theirs, ,
'who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the'
public capitulation.

Tho hoatswain defended this quarrel when we were after-
wards on board. He said it was true that we seemed to
break the truce, but really had not; and that the war was
begun the night before by the natives themselves, who had
shot at us, and killed one of our men without any just provo-
cation; so that as we were in a. capacity to fight them now,
we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon
them in an extraordinary manner 3 that though the poor man
had taken a little liberty with the girl, he ought not to have
been murdered, and that in such a villanous manner; and
that they did nothing but what was just and what the laws of
God allowed to be done to murderers. One would think this
should have been enough to have warned us against going on
shore amongst heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible
to make mankind wise but at their own expense, and their
experience seems to be always of most use to them when it is
dearest bought.

\Ve were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence
to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal;
where if he missed his business outward-bound, he was to go
out to China, and return to the coast as he came home. The
first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where
five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the
gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed, or
carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were u
not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get 0E their
boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retribution of
Heaven in this case 3 but the boatswain very warmly told me,
he thought I went further in my censures than I could show
any warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 4-,
where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the
Tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galilean: 3
but that which put me to silence in the case was, that not one
of these five men who were now lost were of those who went
on shore to the massacre of Madagascar, so I always called it,
though our men could not bear to hear the word museum's
with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had
Iworsc consequences than I expected ; and the boatswain, who
had been the head of the attempt, mine up boldly to me one
time, and told me he found that I brought that afiair con-
tinually upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon
it, and had used the men very ill on that account, and himself
in particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no
command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they Were not
obliged to bear it ; that they did not know but I might havo
some ill-design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an
account for it when they came to England; and that, there-
fore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also not
to concern myself any further with him, or any of his affairs.
he would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail
with me among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then
told him that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre
of Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my
mind freely about it, though not more upon him than any of
the rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was
true ; nor did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty
of speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us
all; and what concern I had in the voyage was none of his
business; that I was a considerable owner in the ship. In
that claim, I conceived I had a. right to speak even further
than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or any -
one else, and began to be a little warm with him. He made
but little reply to me at that time, and I thought the afi'air
had been over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal ;
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the
supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards
evening was preparixlg to go on board, when one of the men
came to me, and told me he would not have me trouble myself
to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me
on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I
was in at so insolent a. message; and I asked the man, who
bade him deliver that message to mel He told me the
coxswain.

J innuodintely found out the supercm'go, and told him the
story, adding, that I foresaw there would he a mutiny in the
ship; and entreeted him to go immediately on board and
acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared this
intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore, the
matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner,
the carpenter, and all the inferior oflicers, as soon as I was
gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to speak with the
mptein; and then the boatswain, nmking 9. long hnrangue,
and repeating all he had said to me, told the captain that as I
was now gone peaceably on shore, they were 10th to use any
violence with me. which, if I had not gone on shore, they
would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped them-
selves to serve in the ship under his command, they would
perform it well and faithfully; but if I would not quit the
ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave
the ship, and sail no further with him; and at that word all,
he turned his face towards the meinmest, which was, it seems,
a signal agreed on, when the seamen, being got twether there,
cried out, " One <<ml all ./ one and all .1"

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, yet he told
them calmly that he would consider of the matter; but that
he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it.
He used some arguments with them, to show them the un-
reasonubleness and injustice of the thing--but it was all in
vain; they swore, and shook hands round before his face,
that they would all go on shore, unless he would engage to
them not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
to me, and did not know how I might take it. So he began
to talk smartly to them; told them that I was a. very con--
sidereblo owner of the ship, and that if ever they came to
England again, it would cost them very deer; that the ship
was mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he
would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige
me so much: so they might do as they pleased. However, he
would go on shore and talk with me, and invited the boot-
swain to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate
the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal, and
said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if
I came on board, they would all go on shore. " Well," said
the captain, " if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore
and talk with him." 80 away he came to me with this
account, a little after tho message had been brought to meSS
from the coxswain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for
I was not without apprehensions that they would confine him
by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship ; and then I
had been stripped naked in a remote country, having nothing
to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse case than
when I was alone in the island. But they had not come
to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and when my
nephew told me what they had said to him, and how they had
sworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the
ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should
not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore. I
only desired he would take care and send me all my necessary
things on shore, and leave me a sulficient sum of money, and I
would find my way to England as well as I could. This was
a. heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there was no way to
help it but to comply ; so, in short, he went on board the ship
again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on board the
ship; so that the matter was over in a few hours, the men
returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course I
should steer.

I was now alone in a most remote part of the world, for I was
near three thousand leagues by sea farther 03 from England,
than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here

lby land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go
from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and
take the way of the caravans, over the desert of Arabia, to
Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea again to Italy,
and so overland into France. I had another way before me,
which was to wait for some English ships, which were coming
to Bengal from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get
passage on heard them from England. But as I came hither
without any concern with the East Indian Company, so it488 1.1111: AND [1111' 111111;" 14.1

would be dillicult to go from hence without their licence,
unless with great favour of tho captains of the ships, or the
Company's factors ; and to both I was an utter stranger.

I liked this p1 opo~111l very well, and the more so because it
seemed to bo expressed with so much good will. In my loose.
unhinged circumstances, ] was the litter to embrace :1. proposal
for tmdo, or indeed anything else. I might pe1h.1p<1 sov with
some t1 11th that if trade was not my olement,m1nl>lin-v 11:13 .
and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which I had
never seen before could possibly come amiss to me. It was,
however, some time before we could get a ship to our minds,
and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English
sailors ; that is to say, so many as were. necessary to govern the
voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick up there.
After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men. With
'those we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen,
such as they were, to make up.

When all was ready we set sail for Achin, in the island of
Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some
of our wares for opium and some arrack ; the first acommodity
which bears a great price among the Chinese, and which, at
at that time, was much wanted there. Then we went up to
Suskan, were eight months out, and on our return to Bengal I
was very well satisfied with my adventure. Om- peoplc in
England often admire how ollicers, which the Company send
into India, and the merchants which generally stay there, get
such very great estates as they do, and sometimes come home
worth sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time ; but it is
little matter for wonder, when we consider the innumerable
ports and place where they have a. free commerce; indeed, at the
ports where the English ships come, there is such great and
constant demands for the growth of all other countries, that
there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market
abroad for the goods carried out.

I got so much money by my first adventure, and such
an insight into the method of getting more, that had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been tempted to
lllVG stayed here, and sought no farther for making any
fortune; but what was all this to a man upwards of three-
score, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a
covctous desire of gaining by it? A restless desire it really
was, for when I was at home, I was restless to go abroad ; and
when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, what
was this gain to me! I was rich enough already, nor had I
any uneasy desires about getting more money; therefore the
profit of the voyage to me was of no great force for the
prompting me forward to further undertakings. Hence, I490 u H; AND Anvnxrcm-xs

thought that by this voy: we 1 had made no progress at all,
because 1 was mine back, as I might call it, to the place from
whence i came, as to a home: whereas, my eye, like that
which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing. I
was come into a part of the world which l was never in before,
and that part. in particular, which 1 had ln-ard much of, and
was resolved to see as much of it as I could : and then] thought
1 might say i had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

~ But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions : 1 ac-
knowledge his were the more suited to the end of a merchant's
lifo : who, when he is abroad upon adventures. is wise to stick
to that, as the best thing for him. which he is likely to get the
most money by. On the other hand, mine was the notion of
a mad, rambling boy. that- never cares to see a thing twice
over. But this was not all : I had u. kind of impatience upon
mo to be nearer home, and yet an unsettled resolution which
way in go. In the interval of those consulmtions, my friend,
who was always upon the search for business, proposed another
voyage among tho Spice Islands, to bring home a loading of
cloves from the Manillas, or thereaboute.

"in were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it. However, at
last. nothing else offering, and as sitting still. to me espeoiully,
was the unhappiost part of life. I resolved on this voyage
too, which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and
several other islands. and came home in about live months,
when we sold our spices, with very great profit, to the Persian
merchants, who carried them away to the gulf. My friend,
when we made up this account, smiled at me: "\Vell, now,"
said he, with a sort of friendly rebuke on my indolent temper,
" is not this better than walking about here, like a man with
nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense
and ignorance of the Pagans? "--" Why, truly," said I, " my
friend, 1 think it is, and l begin to be a convert to the princi~
pics of merchandising; but I must tell you, by the way, you
do not know what I am doing ; for if I once conquer my
backwardnoss, and embark heartily. old as I 'am, 1 shall
harass you up and down the world till I tire you ; for I shall
pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie stil ."

A little while after this there came in a. Dutch ship from.
Batavia ; she was a. coaster, not on European trader, of about
two hundred tons burden; the men, as they pretended, having
been so sickly that the captain had not hands enough to go to
sea with, so he lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, got
money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go for
Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his ship. This
came to my ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had
a grent mind to buy it; so I went to him and told him of
it. He considered a while, for he was no rash man neither;
and at last replied, " She is a little too big--however, we will
have her." Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agreeing
with the master, we paid for her, and tool: possession. When
we had done so we resolved to engage the men, if we could,
to join with those we had, for the pursuing our business; but,
on a. sudden, they having received not their wages, but their
share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not one of
them was to be found ; we inquired much about them, and at
length were told that they were all gone together by land to
Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence, to proceed from
thence to Surat, and then go by sea, to the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while, as that' I
should miss the opportunity of going with them; for such a
ramble, I thought, and in such company as would both have
guarded and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my
great design ; and I should have both seen the world, and gone
homewurd, too. But I was much better satisfied a few days
after, when I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for,
in short, their history was, that this man they called captain
was the gunner only, not the commander; that they had
been a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on
shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the captain and
three of his men ; and that, after the captain was killed, these
men, eleven in number, having resolved to run away with the
ship, brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men
more on shore.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came
honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess.
examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we never
inquired anything of the seamen, who would certainly have
faltered in their account, and contradicted one another.
Somehow or other we should have had reason to have sus-
pected them ; but the man showed us a bill of sale for the
ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for I
suppose it was all a forgery, and called himself by that name.
and we could not contradict him: and withal, having no
suspicion of the thing, wn went through with our bargain.
W'o picked up some more. English sailors hero after this, and
some Dutch ; and now "-0 resolved on a second voyage to the
south-cast for cloves, Ne. ; that is to say. among the Philippine
and Molucca isles. In short, not to fill up this part of my
istory with trilles, when what is to come is so remarkable, i.
spent, from first to last, six years in this country, trading
from port. to port, backward and forward, and With very good
success, and was now the last year with my new partner,
going in the ship alim'v mentioned. on a voyage to China, but
designing first to go to Siam. to buy rice.
in this voyage. being by contrary winds obliged to beat up
and down a great whilu in the Straits of Malacca, and among
the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those diliicult seas
than we found our ship had sprung a leak, but could not,
discover where it was. This forced us to make some port ;
and my partner, who knew the country better than 1 did,
directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia. ; for 1
had made the J'Inglish mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not
being willing to take the charge of the ship upon myself.
This river lies on the north sndo of the great hay or gulf which
goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on
shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, a gnnnur's mate on board an English East-India ship,
then riding in the same river. " Sir," says he, addressing me,
" you are a stranger to me, and I to you 3 but I have some-
thing to tell you that very nearly concerns you. I am moved
-by the imminent danger you are in, and, for ought. I see, you
' have no knowledge of it."--"I know no danger I am in,"
said 1, " but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out:
but I intend to lay her aground to marrow, to see if I can find
it."~ ~" But, sir," says he, "leaky or not leaky, you will be
wiser than to lay your ship on shore tomorrow, when you hear
what I have. to say to you. Do you know, sir," said he, " the
town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up the river; and
there are two large English ships about five leagues on this
side, and three Dutch 1 "----" Well," said I, " and what is that
to me'l"--" Why, sir," said he, " is it for a. man that is upon
such adventures as you are, to come into a port, and not
examine first what ships there are there, and whether he is able
to deal with them! I suppose you do not think you are a
match for them?" I could not conceive what he meant; and
I turned short upon him, and said: " I wish you would explain
yourself ; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of
any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships. I am no inter-
loper. What can they have to say to me?"--" Well, sir,"
says he, with a smile, " if you think yourself secure, you must
take your chance; but, take my advice, if you do not put to
sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked by
five long-boats full of men. and perhaps, if you are taken, you
will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined
afterwards. I thought, sir," added he, " I should have met
with a better reception than this, for doing you a piece of
service of such importance."--"I can never be ungrateful,"
said I, "for any service, or to any man that 03ers me any
kindness; but it is past my comprehension what they should
have such a. design upon me for : however, since you say there
is no time to be lost, and that there is some villanous design
on hand against me, I will go on board this minute, and put
to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak; but, sir,"
said I, "shall I go away ignorant of the cause of all this?
Can you give me no further light into it? "

" I can tell you but put of the story, sir," says he ; "but
I have a Dutch seamen here with me, and I believe I could
persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for
it. But the short of the story is this--the first part of which
I suppose you know well enough--that you were with this
ship at Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by the
Malays, with three of his men; and that you, or some of those
that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are
since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and you
will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed
with very little ceremony; for you know merchant ships show
but little law to pirates, if they get them into their power."--
" Now you speak plain English," said i, "and I thank you;
and though I know nothing that we have done like what you
talk of, for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the
ship ; yet seeing such a work is doing, as you say, and that you
seem to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard."--" Nay,
air," says he, " do not talk of being upon your guard ; the best
defence is to be out of danger. If you have any regard for
you): life, and tho lives of all your men, put to sea without
fail at. high water; and as you have a. whole tide before you,

venture to follow you far out to sea, especially if it blows. "--.

" Well," said I, "you have been very kind in this : what shall
I do to make you amends? "--" Sir," says he, " you may not
be willing to make me any amends, because you may not be
convinced of the truth of it. I will make an odor to you : I
have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ,
which I came out of England in; and the Dutchman that is
l . - .

With me has seven months' pay due to him. If you Will make'

good our pay to us, we will go along with you; if you find

nothing more in it, we will desire no more ; but if we do con-

vince you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the

lives of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to you. "

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board,
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's
side, my partner, who was on board, came out on the quarter~
deck, and called to me, with a great deal of joy, " We have
stopped the leak--we have stopped the leak 1 "--"Say you
so," said I ; " thank God ; hut weigh anchor, then, imme~
diatoly."--" VVoigh 2 " says he ; " what do you mean by that i

sot all hands to work, and weigh without losing a. minute."
lie was surprised; however, he called the captain, and he im-
mediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and though the
tide was not quite down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we
stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told
him the story; and we called in the men, and they told us the
rest of it ; but as it took up agreat deal of time, before we
had done, a seamen comes to the cabin door, and called out to
us that the captain bade him tell us we were chased by five
sloops, or boats, full of men.--" Very well," said I, " then it
is apparent there is something in it." I then ordered all our _
men to be called up, and told them there was a. design to seize
the ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them if they
would stand by us, and by one another; the men answered

' cheerfully, one and all, that they would live and die with us.
Then I asked the captain what way he thought best for us to
mange a fight with them; for resist them 1 was resolved we
would, and that to the last drop. He said readily, that the
way was to keep them ofi' with our great shot as long as we
could, and then to "so our small arms, to keep them from
bom'diug us : but when neither of these would do nun. longer,<<191'>> LIFE AND An1'nNT111ms

time, one shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet
fell in among the men, and we could easily see did a great
deal of mischief among them. We now were the ship again,
and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three
guns more, we found the boat was almost split to pieces ; in
particular, her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot quite
away ; so they handed her sail immediately, and were in great
disorder. To complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly
two guns at them again; where he hit them we could not
tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and some of the men
already in the water: upon this, I immediately manned out
our pinunce, with orders to pick up some of the men, if they

could, and save them from drowning, and immediately come

on board ship with them, because We saw the rest of the boats
began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their
orders, and took up three men. one of whom was just drowning,
and it was a good while before we could recover him. As
soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail we could
make, and stood farther out to the sea; and we found that
when the other boats came up to the first, they gave over
their chase.

Being thus delivered from a. danger, which, though I knew
not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I
apprehended, I resolved that we should change our course, and
not let any one know whither we were going: so we stood
out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European
ships, whether they were bound to China or anywhere else,
within the commerce of the European nations. When We
were at sea, we began to consult with the two seamen, and
inquire what the meaning of all this should be; and the
Dutchman confirmed the gunner's story, about the false sale
of the ship and of the murder of the captain, and also how that
he, this Dutchman, and four more, get into the woods, where
they wandered about 2. great while, till at length he made his
escape, and swam OE to a Dutch ship, which was sailing near
the shore in its way from China.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest
in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had
run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a. set of pirates,
who were gone a-cruizing in her, and that they had already

taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden.

This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we

knew it to be false ; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepos-

session against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to
have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at
their hands ; especially considering that our uccuscrs had been

our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from

them but what rage would have didated, and an ungoverned '
passion have executed. Therefore it was his opinion we
should go directly hack to Bengal, from whence we came,

without putting in at any port whatever,--because there we
could give a. good account of ourselves, could prov." where we
were when the ship put in, of whom we bought; h r, and the
like; and, what was more than all the rest. if we were put
upon the nocesxity of bringing it before the pro; or judges, we
should be sure to have some justice, and not to be hanged first,

and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's opinion _: but after a little
more Serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a. very
giant hazard for us to attempt. returning to Bengal, for that
we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malnccn, and that.
if tho alarm was given, we should he sure to be wnylnid on
every side: ---t-lmt if we should be taken, as it were running
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the
English sailor's opinion, who said he was of my mind, :md
that we should certainly be taken. This danger o. little
start-led my partner, and all the ship's company, and we
immediately resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin,
and so on to the coast of China,~--and, pursuing: the Ill'si.
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the. country,
such as we could get. This was approved of as the lu-st
method for our security; and accordingly we steered away
N.N.E. keeping above fifty leagues off from the usual course
to the eastward. This, however, put us to some inconvenience:
for, first, the winds, when we came that distance from the
shore, seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing almost
trade, as we call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we were a
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with
victuals for so long a run; and, what was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships, whose
boats pursued us, whereof some were bound that way, might
have got in before us, and if not, some other ship bound to
China. might have information of us from them, and pursue us
with the same vigour. _
' I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself)!
including the late escape from the long-boats, to have been
in the most dangerous condition that ever I was in through,
my past life; for whatever ill circumstances I had been in,'
I was never pursued for a. thief before ; nor had I ever done
anything that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent,
much less thievish. I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as
I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own;
but now I was wofully embarrassed; for though I was per--
fectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence
appear; and if I had been taken, it had been under a. sup-
posed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to
make an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or
what port or place we could go to. My partner endeavoured
to encourage me by describing the several ports of that coast,
and told me he would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or
the buy of Tonquin, intending afterwards to go to Macao,
where a great many European families resided,---and particu-
larly the missionary priests, who usually went thither in order
to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though
after a. tedious course, and very much stmitened for provi-
sions, we came within sight of the coast very early in the
morning ; and upon reflection on the past circumstances of
danger we were in, we resolved to put into a small river,
which, however, had depth enough of water for us, and to see
' if we could, either overland or by the ship's pinnmce, come to
know what ships were in any port thereabouts. This happy
step was, indeed, our deliverance: for though we did not
immediately see any European ships in the bay of Tonquin,
yet the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch
ships ; and a third without any colours spread out, but which
we believed to be aDutchman, passed by at about two leagues'
distance, steering for the coast of China; and in the afternoon
went by two English ships steering the same course; and
thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies both one
way and the other. The place we were in was wild and
barbarous,--the people thieves by occupation; and though,
it is true. we had not much to seek of them, and, except
getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had to do
with them, yet it was with much difficulty that we kept
ourselves from being insulted by them several ways. We
were in a small river of this country, within a few leagues
of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted
northeast, to the point of land which opens the great bay
of Tonquin; and it was in this beating up along the shore
that we discovered we were surrounded with enemies. The
people we were among were the most barbarous of all the
inhabitants of the coast; and among other customs, they
have this one: that if any vessel has the misfortune to be
shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men all prisoners
or slaves; and it was not long before we found a spice of their
kindness this way, one the occasion following.

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at sea,
and that we could not find it out; and it happened that, as I
have said, it was stopped unexpectedly, on the eve of our being
pursued by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam ;
yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as
we desired, we resolved while we were at this place to lay her
on shore, and clean her bottom. and, if possible, to find out
where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the
ship, and brought all our guns and other movables to one
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her
bottom 3 but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her

l, m dry ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants came wondering down the shore to look
it us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a
manner, and heeling in towards the shore, and not seeing
our men, who were at work on her bottom with stages, and
with their boats on the elf-side, they presently concluded that
the ship was cast awa ', and lay fast on the ground. On this
supposition, they came about us in two or three hours' time
with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them eight,
some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on
board and plundered the ship. and if they found us there, to
have carried us away for slaves.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row round
her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the
ship's bottom and side, washing, and graving, and stopping,
as every seafaring man knows how. They stood for a. while
gazing at us, and we, who were a little surprised, could not
imagine what their design was 3 but being willing to be sure.
we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were
at work, to defend themselves with, if there should he occasion
And it was no more than need : for in less than a quarter of R
an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship
was really a wreck, and that we were all at work endea-
vouring to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our
boats; and when we handed our arms into the boat, they
concluded, by that not, that we were endeavouring to save
some of our goods; upon this, they took it for granted we
all belonged to them, and away they came directly upon our
men, as if it had been in a line-of-battle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened,
for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to
know what they should do. I immediately called to the men
that worked upon the stages to slip them down, and get up the
side into the ship, and bade those in the boat to row round
and come on board. The few who were on board worked with
all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights ;
however, neither the men upon the stages nor those in the
boats could do as they were ordered, before the Cochin Chinese
were upon them, when two of their boats boarded our long-
boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a
stout, strong fellow, who havmg a musket in his hand, never
ofiered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a. fool, as I
thought; but he understood his business better than I could
teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by
main force out of their boat into ours, where, taking him by
the ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that
the fellow died in his hands. In the meantime, a Dutchman.
who stood next, took up the musket, and with the butt-end of
it so laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who
attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little towards
resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because ignorant of
their danger, began to throw themselves into the long-boat,
where we had but five men in all to defend it; but the follow-
ing accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our men a
complete victory.

Our wrperrter being prepared to grave the outside of the
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to
stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the best,
one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with resin, tallow,
and oil, and such stuff as the Shipwrights use for that work ;
and the man that attended the carpenter had a. great iron ladle
in his hand, with which he supplied the men that were at work
with the hot stuff. Two of the enemy's men entered the boat
just where this fellow stood in the fore-sheets; he immediately
saluted them with o ladle-full of the stulf, boiling hot, which
so burned and scolded them, being half-naked, that they roared
out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both into the
sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, " Well done, J ack !
give them some more of it: " and stepping forward himself,
takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and
his man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of
all the men in the three bouts, there was not one that escaped
being scalded in a most frightful manner, and made such a
bowling and crying, that I never heard a worse noise.

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger
was imminent before, but as we got this victory without any
bloodshed, except of that men the seamun killed with his
naked hands, and which I was very much concerned at.
Although it may be a. just thing, because necessary (for there
is no necessary wickedness in nature), yet I thought it was a
sad sort of lif , when we must be always obliged to be killing
our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves--and, indeed, I
think so still ; and I would even now suil'er a great deal, rather
than I would take away the life even of the worst person
injuring me; and I believe all considering people, who know
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered
seriously into the consideration of it.

All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who
managed the rest of the men on board, had with great
dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and having got
the guns into their places again, the gunner called to me to
bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not ofier to
fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him; but
bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was
on board, took care of. However, the enemy was so terrified
with what they had met with in their first attack, that they
would not come on again ; and some of them who were farthest
ofi, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we
suppose, to see their mistake, and gave over the enterprise,
finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this -
merry fight; and having got some rice, and some roots and
bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we
resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came
of it; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the
next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-
kettlo would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our
things on board the same evening, and the next morning were
ready to sail: in the meantime, lying at anchor at some dis-
tance from the shore, we were not so much concerned, being
new in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if
any enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our
work within board, and finding our ship was perfectly healed
of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into the
bay of 'l'onquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what
was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been
there ; but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we
kept on N. E. towards the island of Formosa, as much afraid
of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a
Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an
Algerine man-of-war.

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E., as if we
would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands ; and this I
we did that we might not fall into the way of any of the;
European ships; and then we steered north, till we came to.
the latitude of 22deg 30' by which means we made the island of
FormOsa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get
water and fresh provisions, which the people there, who are
very courteous in their manners, supplied us with willingly,
and dealt very fairly and punctunlly with v n all their agree-
ments and bargains. This is what we did find among other
people, and may be owing to the remains of Christianity which
was once planted here by a Dutch miseionary of Protestants,
and it is a testimony of what I have often observed, viz. that
the. Christian religion always civilizes the people, and reforms
their manners; where it is received, whether it works saving
i-ll'ects upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China
at. an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports
of ('hin; where our European ships usually come 3 being
resolved if possible, not to fall into any of their hands,
especially in this country, where, as our circumstances were,
wevould not fail of being entirely ruined. Being now come
to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to put into the first
hauling port we should come at ; and standing in for the shore,
a boat (-mno olf hm leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot
on board, who. knowing us to be an European ship, came to
oll'cr his service, which, indeed, we were glad of and took him
on boanl; upon which, without asking us whither we would
go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back. I
thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man
('al us whither we. would. that I began to talk to him about
carrying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the most northern
part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew the
Gulf of Nankin ver ' well ; but smiling, asked us what we
would do them? I told him we would sell our cargo and
purchase China. wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
d'c. ; and so we would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port would have been to put in at Macao,
where we could not how failed of a market for our opium to
our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all
sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at Nankin.

Not being able. to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he. was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were:
gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go
and see the great city of Pekin, and the famous court of the
monarch of China. " Why, then," says the old man, "you
should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the great canal.
This canal is a navigable stream, which goes through the heart
of that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and
goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near two hund ml
and seventy leagues."-----" Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese,
but that is not our business now; the great question is, if you
can carry us up to the city of Nankin, from whence we can
travel to Pekin afterwards?" He said he could do so veiy
well, and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way
just before. This gave me a. little shock, for a Dutch ship was
now our terror, and we had much rather have met the devil,
at least if he had not come in too frightful a figure; and we
depended upon it that a. Dutch ship would be our destruction,
for we were in no condition to fight them ; all the ships they
trade with into those parts being of great burden, and of much
greater force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, " Sir,
you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I suppose
they are not now at war with your nation l"---" No," said I,
"that's true; but I know not what liberties men may take
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own
country."--" Why," says he, " you are no pirates; what need
you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable merchants,
sure." These words put me into the greatest disorder and
confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to conceal it
so, but the old man easily perceived it.

"Sir," says he, "I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way you
think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I
am." Upon this we fell into further discourse, in which, to
my alarm and amazement, he spoke of the villanous doings
of a certain pirate ship that had long been the talk of mariners
in those seas; no other, in a word, than the very ship he was
now on board of, and which we had so unluckily purchased.
I presently saw there was no help for it but to tell him the
plain truth, and explain all the danger and trouble we had
suffered through this misadventure, and, in particular our
earnest wish to be speedily quit of the ship altogether: for
which reason we had resolved to carry her up to Nankin.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and- told us we
were in the right to go away to the north; and that, if he
might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which
we might well do, and buy or build another in the country;
adding, that I should meet with customers enough for the
ship at Nankin, that a. Chinese junk would serve me very

well 450 go back again; and that he would fimcure me people
both to buy one and sell fihe other. "Well, but, seignior,"
said I, "as you say they know the ship so well, I may, per-
haps, if I follow your measures, be Instrumental to bring
some honest, innocent men into a. terrible broil; for wherever
they find the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by
proving this was the ship."--" Why," says the old man, " I'll
find out a way to prevent that 3 for as I know all those com-
manders you speak of very well, and shall see them all as they
pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and
let them know that they had been so much in the wrong; that
though the people who were on board at first might run away
with the ship, yet it was not true that they had turned
pirates ; and that, in particular, the: e were not the men that
first went olt' with the ship, but innocently bought her for
their trade; and [ am persuaded they will so far believe me,
as at least to act more cautiously for the time to come."

In about thirteen days' sail we came to an anchor, at the
south--west point of the great Gulf of Nankin ; where I learned
by accident that two Dutch ships were gone the length before
me, and that I should ceitainly fall into their hands. I con-
sulted my partner again in this exigency, and he was as much
at a loss as I was. I then asked the old pilot if there was
no creek or harbour which I might put, into and pursue my
business with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of
the enemy. He told me if I would sail to the southward
about foity-two leagues, there was a little port called Quin~
clumg, where the fathers of the mission usually landed from
Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian religion to
the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in; and
ii [thought to put in there, I might consider what further
course to take when I was on shore. He confessed, he said,
it was not a place for merchants, except that at some certain
times they had a. kind of a fair there, when the merchants
from Japan came over thither to buy Chinese merchandises.
The name of the port I may perhaps spell wrong, having lost
this, together with the names of many other places set down
in a little pocket-hook, which was spoiled by the water by an
accident; but this I remember, that the Chinese merchants
we corresponded with called it by a difieront name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, who pronounced it Quin-
chang. As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this
place, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on.508 urn AND Iowan-roars

shore where we were, to get fresh water; on both which 0cm.-
sions the people of the country were very civil, and brought
almmlanoo of provisions to sell to us: but nothing without
money.

Wu did not come to the. other port (the wind being con~
two-y) for five. days; but it was very much to our satisfaction,
and l was thankful, when I set my foot on shore, resolving,
and my partnor too, that if it was possible to dispose of out
so] res and ell'eets any other way, though not profitably, we
would never more set foot- on board that unhappy vessel.
Jndood. I mint aeknmvledge, that of all tho circumstances
of life that ever 1 had any experience of. nothing makes man-
kind so completely miserable as that of being in constant
fear. "'ell does the Scripture say, "The fear of man brings
a shalt-.2" it is a life. of death, and the mind is so entirely
oppwssod by it. that it is mpable of no relief.

Nor did it fail of its usual opemtions upon the fancy, by
hoightoning every danger; representing the English and Dutch
captains to be. men incapable of hearing reason, or of rlis~
tinguishin;r hot-ween honest men and rogues: or between a
story mloulated for our own turn, made. out of nothing, on
purlmse to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole
voyage, progress, and design; for we. might many ways have
convinced any reasonable creatures that we were not pirates;
tho goods we. had on board, the course we steewd, our frankly
showing ourselves. and entering into such and such ports;
and even our Very manner, the force we had, the number of
men. the few arms. the little ammunition, short provisions;
all those would have served to convince any men that we were
no pirates. Tho opium and other goods we had on board
would make it appear the. ship had been at Bengal. The
Dutchmen, who. it was said, had the names of all the men
that were in the ship. might easily see that we were A mix-
ture of English. Portuguese, and Indians, and but two
huh-lumen on hoard. These, and many other particular cir-
emustanres. might have made it evident to the understanding
of any commamler, whose hands we might fall into, that we
Wore no pirates.

But. fear, that blind useless passion. worked another way,
and throw us into the vapours; it bewildered our under-
standings, and set the imagination at work to form a thousand

\
ternble things that perhaps might never happen. We first
supposed, as indeed everybody had related to us, that the
seamen on board the English and Dutch ships, but especially
the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and
especially at our beating off their boats and esca ing, that
they would not give themselves leave to inquire w ether we
.were pirates or no, but would execute us ofi hand, without
giving us any room for a defence. We reflected that there'
really was so much apparent evidence before them, that they
would scarce inquire after any more ; as, first, that the ship
was certainly the same, and that some of the seamen among
them knew her, and had been on board her; and, secondly,
that when we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that
they were coming down to examine us, we fought their boats
and fled. Therefore we made no doubt but they were as fully
satisfied of our being pirates, as we were satisfied of the con-
trary; and, as I often said, I know not but I should have
been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, if
the tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have
made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without
believing, or erhaps considering what they might have to
offer in their efenee.

But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions ;
and both my partner and I scarce slept a night without
dreaming of halters and yard-arms; of fighting, and being
taken; of killing, and being killed: and one night I was in
such a fury in my dream, faneying the Dutchmen had boarded
us, and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I
struck my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in
with such a force as wounded my hand grievously, broke my '
knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it awaked me
out of my sleep. Another apprehension I had was, the cruel
usage we might meet with from them if we fell into their
hands: then the story of Amboyna came into my head, and
how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our
countrymen there, and make some of our men, by extremity
of torture, confess to crimes they never were guilty of, or
own themselves and all of us to be pirates, and so they would
put us to death with a formal appearance of justice; and that
they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and
cargo, worth altogether (out or five thousand pounds. We'510 mm: AM) ADVHN'I'Ulll-ZS or uomxsoN console.

did not consider that tho captains of ships have no authority
to not thus; and ii wu had uurrcmlvrcd prisoners to them,
they could not unswor the destroying us, or torturing us, but;
would be accountable for it when they came to their country.
llowcvur, it they wore to act thus with us, what advantage
would it be to us that they should be culled to an account for
it ?-or if we were first to be murdered, wlmt satisfaction
would it he to us to have them punished when they came
homo?

I cannot mirnin tnhing notico horo whut reflections I now
had upon the wwt vnrivty of my particular (:ircunmtnm-es ; how
hard l thought it that I, who had spout forty years in a. life
of continual ditlioultios, and was at; Inst come. as it wore, to
the port or huvvnwhirh all men drive at, viz. to have rust. and
plenty, should ho a volunlocr in new sorrows by my own un-
happy choice, and that I, who luul Cat'flPNl so many dangers in
my youth, should now umue to ho hungml in my old ago, and
in no remote u phwo. for a crime which 1 was out in the
loust inclined to, much less guilty of. Altar those thoughts,
sonwthing of religion would como in; and I would be con-
sidering that this seemed to me to be :L disposition of imme-
diate Providence, and I ought to look upon it and >ubmit to it

from being innocent as to my Mukor; and I ought to look in
and examine what othor crimes in my life were most obvious
to me. and for which l'rovidenco might justly inflict. this

this, just as 1 would to n. shipwwck, if it hnd plousod (ind to

eyes spm-kle, as if I was engaged, and I always resolved to
take no quarter at their hands; but, even, at last, if I could
resist nolonger, I would blow up the ship and all that was in
her, and leave them but little booty to boast of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater
was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and
my [hither told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy
load upon his back. which he was to carry up a hill, and found '
that he was not able to stand longer under it; but that the
Portuguese pilot came and took it ofi his bank, and the hill
disappeared, the ground before him appearing all smooth
and plain : and truly it was so; they were all like men who
had a. lo id taken 0% their backs. For my part, I had a
weight taken off from my heart that it was not able any
longer to hear; and as I said above, we resolved to go no
more to sea in that ship. When we came on shore, the old
pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging, together with
a warehouse for our goods; it was a little but, with a larger
house adjoining to it, built and also palisadoed round with
canes, to keep out pilferers, of which there were not a few in
that country: however, the magistrates allowed us a little
guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of half-pike, who
stood sentinel at our door; to whom we alloweda pint of rice,
and a piece of money, about the value of three-pence, per day,
so that our goods were kept very safe.

The fair, or mart, usually kept at this place, had been over
some time: however, we found that there were three or four
junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with goods
which they had bought in China, and were not gone away,
having some Japanese merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to
get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who
were in the town, and who had been there some time convert-
ing the people to Christianity; but we thought they made
but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when
they haul done. One of these was a Frenchman, whom they
called Father Simon; another was a Portuguese; and the
third a Genoese. Father Simon was courteous, and very .
agreeable company; but the other two were more reserved,
seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work!

E x .
they came about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate themselves
among the inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity. We
often ate and drunk with those men; and though, I must
confess, the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to
('ln-istinnity. is so far from the true conversion required to
bring hoathon people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to'
amount to little more than letting them know the name of
Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son,
in a. tongue which they understood not. and to cross them--
selves, and the like; yet it must he confessed that the reli-
gi mists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief that
[hos-o people will he saved, and that they are the instruments
of it _; and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue
of the voyage, and the. hazards of living in such places, but
oftentimes death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the
sake of this work.

Father Simon was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief
of the mission. to go up to Pekin, and waited only for another
priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go
along with him. \Ve scarce ever met together but he was
inviting me to go that. journey : telling me how he would show
me all tho glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among
the rest. l'okiu. the greatest city in the world: "a city."
said he. "that your London and our Paris put together cannot
be. equal to." But as I looked on those things with diilerent
oyos from other men. so I shall give my opinion of them in a.
few words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak
more particularly of them.

Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very merry
together. 1 showed some little inclination to go with him ; and
he pressed me and my partner very hard to consent. " Why,
father." says my partner, "should you desire our company
so much 2 you know we are heretics, and you do not love us,'
nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure."--" Oh," says
he. "you may perhaps be good Catholics in time; my busx-
noss here is to convert hoathens. and who knows but I may
convert you tool"~--"\'ery Well. father," said 1, "so you
will preach to us all the vay '? "----" I will not he troublesome
to you." says he; "our religion does not divest us of good
manners: besides, we are here like countrymen; and so we
are, compared to the place we are in ; and if you are
Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may all be Christians at last;
at least, we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, with-
out being uneasy to one another." I liked this part of his
discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of my
priest that I had left in the Brazils 3 but Father Simon did
not come up to his character by a great deal ; for though this
friar had no appearance of a criminal levity in him, yet he
had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere
affection to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic had.

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, no:

solicited us to go with him; we had something else before us -

at first, for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise
to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what we should
do, for we were now in a place of very little business. Once
I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and the
city of Nankin; but Providence seemed now more visibly, as
I thought, than ever to concern itself in our affairs ; and I was
encouraged, from this very time, to think I should, one way or
other, get out of this entangled circumstance, and be brought
home to my own country again, though I had not the least
view of the manner. Providence, I say, began here to clear
up our way a little; and the first thing that ofiered was, that
our old Portuguese pilot brought :1 Japan merchant to us, who
inquired what goods we had ; and, in the first place, he bought
all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us
in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and
some in small wedges, of about ten or twelve ounces each.
While we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into
my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship too, and I
ordered the interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up
his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him; but in'
a few days after he came to me, with one of the missionary
priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to
make to me, which was this: he had bought a great quantity
of our goods, when he had no thoughts of proposals made to
him of buying the ship ; and that, therefore, he had not money
to pay for the ship: but if I would let the same men who
weie in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to
Japan; and would send them from thence to the Philippine
Islands with another loading, whieh he would pay the freight
of before they went from J span: and that at their rezturn he
' K K
would buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposal, and so
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not
but begin to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and
so to set sail from the Philippine Islands away to the South
Sam ; accordingly, I asked the Japanese merchant if he would
not hire us to the Philippine Islands and discharge us there.
_lle said No, he could not do that, for then he could not have
the return of his cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan,
at the ship's return. \Vell, still I was for taking him at that
proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than
myself. persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as
woll of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and
treacherous people; likewise those of the Spaniards at the
Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they.

But to bring this long turn of our alfairs to a conclusion;
the first thing we had to do was, to consult with the captain of
the ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to
go to Japan. \Vhilc I was doing this, the young man whom
my nephew had left with me as my companion came up, and told
me that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and that
there was a great prospect of advantage, and he would be very
glad if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would
give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or as I pleased to
order him ; that if ever he came to England, and I was there
and alive, he would render me a faithful account of his
success, which should be as much mine as I pleased. I was
loth to part with him ; but considering the prospect of advan-
t-igo, which really was cousidemble, and that he was a. young
fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him go; but I
told him I would consult my partner, and give him an answer
'the next day. I discoursed about it with my partner, who
thereupon made a most generous offer: " You know it has
been an unlucky ship," said he, "and we both resolve not to
go to sea in it again ; if your steward (so he called my man)
will venture the voyage, I will leave my share of the vessel to
him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live to meet
in England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall account
for one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us; the
other shall be his own."

If my partner, who was no wa ' concerned with my young
man, made him such an odor, 1 could not do less than ofior
him the same; and all the ship's company being willing to go
with him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and
took a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other,
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a
very punctual, honest man to him; protected him at Japan,
and got him a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans
in general have not lately obtained. He paid him his freight
very punctually; sent him to the Philippines, lowed with
Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who,
trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European goods
again. and a great quantity of spices; and there he was not
only paid his freight very well. and at a very good price, but
not being willing to sell the ship then the merchant furnished
him goods on his own account; and with some money, and
some spices of his own which he brought with him, he went
back to the Manillas, where he sold his cargo very well.
Here, having made a good acquaintance at Manilla, he, got his
ship made a free ship, and the governor of Manilla hired him
to go to Acapulco, on the coast of America, and gave him a
licence to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in
any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made the
voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there he sold his
ship: and having thereaalso obtained allowance to travel by
land to Porto Bello, he found means to get to Jamaica, with
all his treasure, and about eight years after came to England,
exceeding rich.

But, to return to our particular affairs: being new to pant
with the ship and ship's company. it came before us, of course,
to consider what'recompence we should give to the two men,
that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in thol
river Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us a very con-- '
siderable service, and deserved well at our hands; though, by
the way, the were acouple of rogues too ; for, as they believed
the story 0 our being pirates, and that we had really run
away with the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray
the design that was formed against us, but to go to sea with
us as pirates. One of them confessed afterwards that nothing else
but the hopes of going a roguing brought him to do it : how--
ever, the service they did us was not the less, and therefore,
as I had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the
money to he paid them. which they said was due to them on
board their respective. ships : over and above that, I gave ouch
of them a small sum of money in gold, which contented them
wry well. .I thou made the Englishman gunner in the ship,
tho gunner being now mado second mate and pursor; the
Dul-rlnuan l unulc boatswain; so they were both very well
pleased, and provml very serviceable, being both ublo seamen,
:unl very stout follows.

"'0 were now on shore in China; if I thought myself
lizmisluul, and remote from my own country at Bengal, whore
1 had many ways to got homo for my money. what could I
think of myself now, when l was about a thousand leagues
further oil'- from home, and destitute of nll manner of prospect
of return? All we had for it was this, that in about four
months" time (hero was to be another fair at the place where
we were, and then we might be able to purchase vurious'nmnu-
fact-mus of the. country, and wrthal might possibly find some
Chinoso jnuks from 'l'onquin for sale, that would carry us and
our goods whither "'o pleased. This I liked very well, and
resolved to wait: besides, as our particular persons were not
obnoxious. so. if any English or Dutch ships came thither,
perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods,
and got passage to some other place in India nearer home.
Upon those hopes. we resolved to continue here; but, to
divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the
country.

1" irst, we wont ton dag-'3' journey to Nuiikin, a city well
worth seeing: they say it has a million of people in it: it is
regularly built. and the streets - '0 all straight, and cross one
anoiher in llll'L'Ula linrs. lint when I come to oompirc the
miserable pcoplo of those countries with ours, their fabrics,
their nmnuur of living. their government. their r 'ligion, their
wealth. and their glory, as some call it, I must confess that I
smrcoly think it worth my while to mention them here. \Ve
womlrr at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies,
the government, the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct
of these people; not that there is really any matter for wonder,
but because, having a true rotion of the barbarity of those
countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail there,
we do not expect to find any such thing so for 0%". Otherwise,
what are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of
Europe '1. \Vlmt their trade to the universal commerce of
England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities
to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture,
and infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets,
our large and powerful naviesi Our city of London has more
trade than half their mighty empire: one English, Dutch, or
French man-of-war of eighty guns, would be able to fight
almost all the shipping belonging to China : but the greatness
of their wealth, their trade, the power of their government,
and the strength of their armies, may be a little surprising to
us, because, as I have said, considering them as a barbarous
nation of Pagans, little better than sayages, we did not expect:
such things among them. But all the forces of their empire,
though they were to bring two millions of men into the field
together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the country,
and starve themselves; a million of their foot could not stand
before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to
be surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in
number; nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand
German or English foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed,
could defeat all the forces of China. Nor is there a fortified
town in China that could hold out one month against the
batteries and attacks of an European army. They have fire-
arms, it is true, but they aie awkward and uncertain in their
going oif; and their powder has but little strength. Their
armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, or
temper to retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed
strange to me, when I came home, and heard our peo le say
such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, an trade
of the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be
a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, sub-
jected to a government qualified only to rule such a people;
and were not its distance inconceivably great from Muscovys
and that empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill
governed as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with ease drive
them all out of their country, and conquer them in one cam-
paign; and had the Czar (who is now a growing prince) fallen
this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, and equally
improved himself in the art of war, as they say he has done;
and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted
him, he might by this time have been Emperor of China,
instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Nerve,
when the latter was not one to six in number.

As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation,
commerce, and husbandry, are very imperfect, compared to
the same things in Europe; also, in their knowledge, their
learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they are either
very awkward, or defective, though they have globes or
spheres, and a smattering of the matheumtics, and think the)
know more than all the world besides. But they know little
of the motions of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly and
absurdly ignorant are their common people, that when the
sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it,
and is going to run away with it; and they fall a clattnring
with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright the
monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees I

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made
in all the accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make
no more such. It is none of my business, nor any part of my
design ; but to give an account of my own adventures through
a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long variety of changes,
which, perhaps, few that come after me will have heard the
like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people, I have yet to
pass through, more than relates to my own stor , and which
my concern among them make necessary.

I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China,
about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned
from Nankin. I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin,
which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon impel-tuned
me daily to do it. At length, his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary who was to go with him being
arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve
either to go, or not ; so I referred it to my partner, and left
it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved it in the
allirmativo, and we prepared for our journey. We set out
with very good advantage, as to finding the way; for we got
leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind
of Viceroy or principal magistrate 1n the province where they
reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with
great attendance, and great homage from the people, who me
sometimes zreatly impoverished by them, being obliged to
furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in their
journeys. I particularly observed in our travelling with his
baggage, that though we received sufficient provisions both for
ourselves and our horses from the country, as belonging to the
mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay for everything we had,
after the market price of the country, and the mandarin's
steward collected it duly from us. Thus our travelling in the
retinue of the mandarin, though it was a great act of kind-
ness, was not such a mighty favour to us, but was a great
advantage to him, considering there were above thirty other
people travelled in the same manner besides us, under the
protection of his retinue; for the country furnished all the
provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for
them.

We were twenty-five days travelling to Pekin, through a
country exceeding populous, but I think badly cultivated;
the husbandry, the economy, and the way of living miserable,
though they boast so much of the industry of the people: I
say miserable, if compared with our own. but not so to these
poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of the poor
people is infinitely great, and exceeded _by nothing but their
poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which I call their
misery; and I must needs think the savages of America lire
much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as
they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are

proud and insolent, and in the main are in many parts mere

beggars and drudges. Their ostentation is inexpressible; and,
if they can, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves,
which is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt
of all the world but themselves.

I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in
the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here,
and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very
convenient for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to
me than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in
the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my
friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these
occasions, to see their beggarly pride. For example, coming
by the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called
him, about ten leagues oif the city of N ankin, we had first of
all the honour to ride with the master of the house about two

mantles, trappings, 8w. that we could scarce see anything but
their feet and their-heads as they went along.

I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and per-
plexity being over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which
made this journey the pleasanter to me; in which no ill acci-
dent attended me, only in passing or fording a. small river, my
horse fell and made me free of the country, as they call it,--
that is to say, threw me in. The place was not deep, but it
wottod me allover. I mention it because it spoiled my pocket-r
book, wherein I had set down the names of several people and
places which I had occasion to remember, and which not
taking due cure of, tho loaves rotted, and the words were
never after to be read.

At length we ill'l'iVVd at Pekin. I had nobody with me
but the youth whom my nephew had given me to attend me
as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and
my partner had nobody with him but one servant, who was a
kiusman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to
see the court, we bore his charges for his company. and for our
use of him as an interpreter, for he understood the language of
the country, and spoke good French and a little English.
Indeed. this old man was most useful to us everywhere ; for we
had not been above a \\'0l'k at Pckin, when he came laughing.
"Ah, Seiguior lnglese," says he, " I have something to tell
will make your heart glad."--" My heart glad." says I;
"what can that be'l I don't know anything in this country
can either give me joy or grief to any great degree.' '---" Yes,
yes," said the old man in broken English, "make you glad,
mo sorry."---"Why." said 1', " will it make you sorry?"--
"Because," said he, "you have brought me here twenty-five
days' journey, and will leave me to go back alone ; and which
way shall 1 get to my port afterwards, without a ship, with-
out a horse, without parum: ?"---so he called money, being his
broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry
with. In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovito and Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set
out on their journey by land to Muscovy, within four or five
weeks ; and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go
with them, and leave him behind, to go back alone.

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and
had scarce power to speak to him for Some time, but at last-
1 said to him, " How do you know this? are you sure it is
true? "--" Yes," says he; "I met this morning in the street
an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among
them. He came last from Astracan, and was designed to go
to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his
mind, and is new resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow,
and so down the river \Volga to Astracan."---" Well, Seignior,"
says I, "do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone ;
if this be a method for my return to England, it shall be
your fault if you go back to Macao at all." ' We then
went to consult together what was to be done ; and I asked
my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and whether
. it would suit with his afiairs'i He told me he would do just
as I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal,
and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made
a good voyage, if he could invest it in China silks, wrought
and raw, he would be content to go to England, and then
make a voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot would go with us, we would hear his charges to Moscow,
or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to he
esteemed over generous in that either, if we had not rewarded
him further, the service he had done us being really worth
more than that; for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea,
but he had been like a broker for us on shore ; and his pro-
curing for us a Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds
in our pockets. So, being willing to gratify him, which was
but doing him justice, and very willing also to have him with
us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all occasions,
we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I
computed it, was worth one hundred and seventy-five pounds
sterling, between us, and to bear all his charges, both for
himself and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this between ourselves, we called him to let
him know what we had resolved. I told him he had com-
plained of our being willing to let him go back alone, and I
was now about to tell him we designed he should not go back
at all. That as we had resolved to go to Europe with the
caravan, we were very willing he should go with us ; and that
we called him to know his mind. He shook his head and said
it was a long journey, and that he had no perm-726 to carry him
thither. or to subsist himself when he came there. We told
him we believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved to
do something for him that should let him see how sensible we
were of the service he had done us. and also how agreeable he
was to us: and then I told him what we had resolved to give
him here, which he might lay out as we would do our own;
and that as for his charges, if he would go with us we
would set him safe. on shore (life and casualties excepted),
either in Muscovy or England, as he would choose, at our own
charge, except only the carrigo of his goods. He received
the proposal like a man transported, and told us he would go
with us over all the whole world; and so we all prepared for
our journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the
other merchants: they had many things to do, and instead of
being ready in five weeks, it. was four months and some days}
before all things were got together. ;

It was the beginning of February, New Style, when we
set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone
express back to the port where we had first put in, to dispoae
of some goods which we had left. there ; and I, with a Chinese
merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nankin, and who
came to Pekin on his own all'airs, went to Rankin, where I
bought ninety pieces of line damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very fine silk of several sorts, some mixed with
gold, and had all those brought to Pekin against my partner's
return. Besides this. we bought a large quantity of raw silk,
and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about. three thousand live hundred pounds sterling;
which. tngnlhnr with tea and some. like ealivoes, and three
mmels' loads of nutmvg< and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels for our share. besides those we. rode upon : these. with
two or three. spare horses, and two horses loaded with pr -
visions. made together twenty-six camels, and horses in our
retinue. '

The company was very great, and, as near as I can re.-
member, made between three and four hundred horses. and
upwards of one hundred and twenty men, very well armed and
provided for all events 3. for as the eastern caravans am
subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the,
Tartars. The. company consisted of people of several nations :
but there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants;
of Moscow, though of them some were Livonians ; and to our
particular satisfaction. five of them were Scots, who appeared
also to be. men of great. experience in business, and of very.
good substance.

\Vhen we had travelled one day's journey. the guides. wbr
were five in number, called all the pissongors. except the
servants, to a great- council as they called it. At this ('num'il,
every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a common
stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on the way,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the
guides, getting horses, and the like. Here, too, they consti--
tuted the journey, as they call it; viz. they named captains
and oflicers to draw us all up, and give the word of command,
in case of an attack, and give every one their turn of command;
nor was this forming us into order any more than what we
afterwards found needful on the way.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous,
and is full of potters and earth'makers, -- that is to say,
people that temper the earth for'the China ware. As I was
coming along, our Portuguese pilot, who had always some-
thing or other to say to make us merry, told me he would
show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I
should have this to say of China, after all the ill-humoured
things that I had said of it, that I had seen one thing which
was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very
importunate to know what it was ; at last he told me it was
a gentleman's house built with China. ware. " Well," says I,
" are not the materials of their buildings the products of their
own country, and so it is all China ware, is it not? "--" No,
no," says he, " I mean it is a house all made of China ware,
such as you call it in England, oras it is called in our country,
porcelain."--" ell," says I, " such a thing may be; how big
is it 1 Can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can we
will buy it."--" Upon a camel 2" says the old pilot, holding up
both his hands; " why, there is afamily of thirty people lives
in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to
it, it was nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house
built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all
this plastering was really China ware,--that is to say, it was
plastered with the earth that makes China ware. The out>>
side, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked
very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as
the large China ware in England is painted, and hard as if it
had been burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the
little square tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all made of
the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with
extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles
making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar:
being made of the same earth, that it was very hard to seal
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the
same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have
in use in several parts of England; as hard as stone, and
smooth. but not burned and painted, except some smaller
rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the
some tile ; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the
whole house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was
covered with tiles of the some, but of a. deep shining black. This
was a China. warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be called
so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could have stayed
some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They
told me there were fountains and fishponds in the garden, all
paved on the bottom and sides with the some; and fine statues
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain
earth, burned whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they ma ' be
allowed to excel in it ; but I am very sure they excel in their
accounts of it: for they told mo such incredible things of
their perfornmncc in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care
not to relate. as knowing it could not be true. They told me,
in particular. of one workman that made a ship with all its
tackle and masts and sails in earthenware. big enough to carry
fifty men. If they had told me he launched it, and made a.
voyage to Japan in it, I might have said something to it
indeed; but as it was. I knew the whole of the story, which
was, in short, that the fellow lied 3 so I smiled, and said
nothing to it. This odd sight kept me two hours behind the
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined me about
the value of three shillings 3 and told me if it had been three
days' journey without the wall, as it was three days within, he
must have fined mo four times as much, and made me ask
pardon the next council day. I promised to be more orderly ;
and. indeed. I found aftern'nrds tho orders made for keeping
all together were absolutely neceswry for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great Chino. \Vall, made
for 1 fortification against the Torture: and a. very great work
it is, going over hills and mountains in an endless tmck, where
the rocks are impassable. and the precipices such as no enemy
could possibly ente1', or indeed climb up, or where, if they did,
no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a
thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred
in a straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without
measuring the windings and turnings it takes; it is about
four fathoms high, and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing on
our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to
look at it on every side, near and far elf; I mean what was
within my View : and the guide, who had been extolling it fix
the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion
of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep out
the Tartars; which he happened not to understand as I meant
it, and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot laughed :
" Oh, Seignior Inglese," says he, " you speak in colours."--
" In colours! " said I, "what do mean by that'l"--"Why,
you speak what looks white this way, and black that way,--
gay one way and dull another. You tell him it is a good well
to keep out Tartars ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing
but to keep out Tartars. I understand you, Seignior Inglese,
I understand you; but Seignior Chinese understood you his
own way."--"Well," says I, " do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery ; or our engineers, with two companies of miners?
Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army might
enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all,
that there should be no sign of it left 2 "-" Ay, ay," says he,
" I know that." The Chinese wanted mightily to know what
I said to the pilot, and I gave him leave to tell him a few
days after, for we were then almost out of their country, and
he was to leave us a little time after this; but when he knew
what I said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we
heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese power and
greatness while he stayed.

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, some-
thing like the Picts' wall, so famous in N orthumberland, built
by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns, as
being subject to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars,
who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be resisted
by the naked inhabitants of an open country. And here I

began to find the necessity of keeping together in :1. ca 'avan as
\\'o travelled, for We saw wrul'al troops of 'l'artars roving about; ;
but, when l mum to seo them distinctly, I wondered more that
the ('hinose empire could be (mnquerod by such contomptiblo
fellows; for they are a more horde. of wild fellows, keoping no
order, and widen-standing no discipline or manner of light.

which was after we entered tho wilder part. of tho country.
Our leader for tho day gavo leave for about. sixtocn of us to go
a hunting as they call it ; and what was this but a hunting of
sheep l--<<however, it may be called hunting, too, for these

with about forl.y 'l'artars : whether they wero hunting mutt-on,

a hideous blast on a kind of horn. This was to call their
friends about, them. and. in loss than ten minutes, a trocp of
forty or fifty more appeared, at about; a mile distance ; but our
work was over first. as it happened.

and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage
too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command.
As soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their
faces, and then drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion
imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on our
h'ight, where three of them stood, and, by signs, called the

hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Our bmve

We had not a man killed or hurt; as for the Tartars, 11mm
were about five of them killed--how many were wounded we
knew not; but this we knew, that the other party were so
frightened with the noise of our guns, that they fled, and
never made any attempt upon us. 2

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and there-
fore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about
five days we entered a vest wild desert, which held us three
days and nights' march: and we were obliged to carry our
water with us in great lenthern bottles, and to encemp all
night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia.
I asked our guides whose dominion this was in, and they told
me this was a kind of border that might be called no men's
land, being a. part of Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary:
that, however, it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but
that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the
im'oads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go over some
much larger.

In passing this frightful wilderness, we saw, two or three
times, little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon
their own afiairs, and to have no design upon us ; and so, like
the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to say to us,
we had nothing to say to them: we let them go. Once, how-
ever, a. party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at
us. Whether it was to consider if they should attack us or
not, we knew not; but when we had passed at some distance
by them, we made a. rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready
for them, letting the caravan pass half a. mile or thereabouts
before us. After a. while they marched ad, but they saluted
us with five arrows at their parting, which wounded a horse so
that it disabled him, and we left him the next- day, poor
creature, in great need of a. good farrier. We saw no more
arrows or Tertars that time.

We travelled near amonth after this, the ways not being so
good as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor

\of China, but lay for the most part in the villages, some of
(which were fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartars.
"When we were come to one of these towns (about two days
and a. half's journey before we came to the city of Naum), I
wanted to buy a. camel, of which there are plenty to be sold
all the way upon that road, and horses also, such as they are,
because, so many caravans coming that way, they are often
wanted. The person that I spoketo to get me a camel, would
have gone and fetched one for me; but I, like a. fool, must be
oflicious, and go myself along with him: the place was about
two miles out of the village, where it seems they kept the
camels and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being
very desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place
it was a low, marshy ground, walled round with stones, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among them, like a park,
with a. little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away, and
the Chinese that went with me led the camel, when on a
sudden came up five Tartars on horseback. Two of them
seized the fellow and took the camel from him, while the
other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it
were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword,
which could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The
first that came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword,
for they are arrant cowards; but a second, coming upon my
left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till after-
wards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the
matter, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground ;
but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese, had a pistol in
his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars either ;
if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked us, for
cowards are always boldest when there is no danger. The old
man seeing me down, with a hold heart stepped up to the
fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm with
one hand, and pulling him down by main force alittle towards
him, with the other shot him in the head, and laid him dead
upon the spot. He then immediately stepped up to him
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come
forward again, made a blow at him with a scimitar, which
he always wore, but missing the man, struck his horse in
the side of his head, out one of the ears 03 by the root,
and a great slice down by the side of his face. The poor
biast, enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed
by his rider, though the fellow eat well enough too, but
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach;
and at some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down
the Tartar, and fell upon him.

"'11 this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon: however, seeing the Tartar
down, and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him.
and seizing upon an ugly weapon he had by his side, some-
thing like a poleaxe, he wrenched it from him, and made shift
to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man
had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing he did not
fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended,
but stood stock still, the old man stood still too, and fell to
work with his tackle to charge his pistol again ; but, as soon
as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he scoured, and left my
pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a complete
victory.

By this time I was a little recovered. I thought, when I
first began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep 3 but, as
I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the
ground, and what was the matter. A few moment: .'efter, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where ; so
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then
I felt my head ache : and in a. moment memory returned, and
everything was present to me again. , I jumped upon my feet
instantly, and got hold of my sword, but no enemies were in
view: I found a Tartar lying dead, and his horse standing
very quietly by him ; and, looking further, I saw my deliveror,
who had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back
with his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me on my
foot, came running to me, and joyfully embraced me, being
afraid before that I had been killed. Seeing me bloody, he
would see how I was hurt; but it was not much, only what
we call a broken head ; neither did I afterwards find any
great inconvenience from the blow, for it was well again in
two or three days.

We. made no great gain, however, by this victory. for we
lost a (wool and gained a horse. I paid for the. lost camel
and sent for another ; but I did not go to fetch it myself : J
hml had enough of that.

The city of Naum, which we were approaching, is a frontier
of the Chinese empire, and is fortified in their fashion. \Ve
wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this city,
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road
to tell all travellers and camvans to halt till they had a guard
sent for them; for that an unusual body of Tartars, making
ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty
miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers: however, it was
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad to
hear we should have a. guard. Accordingly, two days after,
we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a. garrison of the
Chinese on our left, and three hundred more from the 'city
of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly. The threl

 

 

CREME 18 WOUNDED I)! A SCI'PPLI: WITH THE nnnne.

hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of our camels,
with our baggage and the whole caravan in the centre; in
this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves
a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartar-s, if they
had appeared ; but the next day, when they did appear, it was
quite andther thing.536 ' LIFE mo [roves-run!!!

Early in the morning, when, marching from a. little town
called Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were obliged
to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had
been the time to have attacked us, when the camven being
over, the rear--guard was behind ; but they did not appear
there. About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, we knew, by a.
cloud of dust they raised, that the enemy was at hand, and
presently they came on upon the spur.

Our Chinese guards, in the front, who had talked so big
tho day before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them, a certain sign in a soldier that he is just
ready to runaway. My old pilot was of my mind 3 and being
near me. called out, " Seignior I nglese, those fellows must be
encouraged, or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tartors come
on they will never stand it."--" I am of your mind," said I ;
" but what must be done'i "--" Done? " says he, "let fifty of
our men advance, and flank them on each wing, and encourage
them. They will fight like bruve fellows in brave company ;
but without this, they will every man turn his back." Imme-
diately I rode up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly
of our mind; accordingly fifty of us marched to the right
wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a. line of rescue ;
and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make
a body by themselves, and to guard the camels; only that,
if need were, they should send a hundred men to assist the
last fifty.

At last, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company
they were; how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we
thought, at the least. A party of them came on first, and
viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of
our line; and, as we found them within gunshot, our leader'-
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a.
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done. They
then went off, I suppose to give an account of the reception
they were like to meet with; indeed, that salute cloyed their
stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to con
sider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over
their design for that time, which was very agreeable to
our circumstances.

Two days after, we came to the city of Noun, or Naum; we
thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected to the
value of a. hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day.
This is a. garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred
soldiers kept here ; but the reason of it was, that formerly
the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do,
the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country,
which lies from this city west for about two hundred miles, as
desolate and unfit for use ; and more especially being so very
remote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its defence :
for we were yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy,
properly so called. After this, we passed several great rivers,
and two dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days
passing over; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the
frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think the first town
or fortress, whichever it may be called, that belonged to the
Czar, was called Arguns, being on the west side of the river
Argune.

I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in
a. country governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites
do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians,
yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their
way. It would certainly occur to any reflecting man who
travels the world as I have done, what a. blessing it is to
he brought into the world where the name of God and a
Redeemer is known, adored, and worshipped ; and not where
the peeple, given up to strong delusions, worship the devil,
and prostrate themselves to monsters, elements, horrid-shaped
animals, and monstrous images. Not a town or city we passed
through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples,
and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own
hands. Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christiar

worship appeared ; where the knee was bowed to Jesus: and,

whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was
owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and
adored ; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the
brave Scots merchant with my first acknowledgment of this ;
and taking him by the hand, I said to him, " Blessed be
God, we are once again amongst Christians." He smiled
and answered, "Do not rejoice too soon, countryman 3 these
_Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the
name of it you may see very little of the substance for some
months further of our journoy."----" Well." says I, " but still
it is better than Paganism, and worshipping of devils."--
" \Vhy, I will (ell you," says he ; " except the Russian
soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of
the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for
above a thousand miles further, is inhabited by the worst
and most ignorant of Pagans." And so, indeed. we found it.

We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth that
is to be found in any part of the World: we had, at least,
twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward; two thousand
to the bottom of tho .laltic Sea, westward; and above three
thousand, if we left that sea, and went on west, to the British
and French channels: we had full five thousand miles to the
Indian or Persian Sea, south; and about eight hundred to the
Frozen Sea, north.

"'0 advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate
journeys, and were. very visibly obliged to the care the Czar
has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as
it is possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison,
something like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans
in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I
had read of were placed in llritain. for the. security of volu-
meree. and for the lodging of travellers. Thus it was here:
for wherever we came. though at these towns and stations the,
garrisons and governors were Russians, and professed Chris-
tians, yet the. inhabitants were more pagans. sacrificing to
idols. and worshipping the sun, moon. and stars, or all the
host of heaven ; and not only so. but were, of all the heathens
and pagans that ever i met with. the most harbm'ous, exrept
only that they did not eat men's tlesh.

Some instances of this we met with in the country between
Argnna. where we enter the Mnscovito dominions, and a city
of Tartars and Russians together, called Nortziousky, in which
is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to
travel over. In a village near the last of those places I had
the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most
brutish and unsull'erable. They had, I suppose, a great sacri-
fice that da . ; for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree,
a. diabolical kind of idol made of wood; it was dressed up, too,
in the most filthy manner; its upper garment was of sheep-
skins, with the wool outward ; a. great Tartar bonnet on the
head, with two horns growing through it ; it was about eight
feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion
of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village;
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeet
creatiu-es all lying flat upon the ground round this hideous
block of wood 3 I saw no motion among them, any more than

 

ClllJSOE INSULTB TUE TARTAR IDOL

if they had been all logs, like the idol, and at first I really
thought they had been so; but, when I came a. little nearer,
they started up upon their feet, and raised a howl, as if it had
been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if
they were displeased at our disturbing them. A little way off
from the idol, and at the door of a. hut, made of sheep and cow
skins dried, stood three men with long knives in their hands ;
and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and
one young bullock. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that
senseless log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging
to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people
who nrought tho olTering, and were making their pmycrs to
that stock.

1 confess [ was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hohgoblin than ever I was at anything in my
life, and, overcome with rage, I rode up to the hideous idol,
and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on
its head. and out it in two; and one of our men that was with
me, taking hold of the sheepskin that covered it, pulled at it,
when, behold, a mes-t hideous outcry ran through the village,
and two or three hundred people came about my cars, so thatI
was glad to scour for it, for some had bows and arrows ; but I
resolved from that moment to visit them again. Our caravan
rnxtod three nights at the town, which was about four miles
oil, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several
of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the long march
over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put my
design in execution. I communicated it to the Scot: merchant,
of whose courage I had sufficient testimony ; I told him what
I. had soon, and with what indignation I limlsince thought that
human nature could be so degenerate; I told him if I could
get but four or five men well armed to go with me, I was
resolved to go and destroy that yile, abominable idol, and let
them see. that it had no power to help itself. and consequently
o-mld not he an object of worship, or to he prayed to, much
less help them that oll'orod sacrifices to it.

He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that,
owing to tho gross ignorance of the people, they could not he
brought to profit by the lesson I meant to teach them: and
added that, from his knowledge of the country and its
customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by giving
olfcnce to these brutal idol worshippers. This somewhat
stayed my purpose. hut I was still uneasy all that day to
put my project-in execution; and that evening meeting the
Scots merchant in our walk about the town, I again called
upon him to aid me in it. \Vhen he found me resolute he said
that. on further thoughts, he could not but applaud tho
design, and told mo 1 should not go alone, but he would'
go with me; but he would go first and bring a. stout follow.
one of his count-r rmen, to go also with us; " and one," said
he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be
against such devilish things as these." So we agreed to go,
only We three and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in
execution the following night about midnight, with all
possible secresy.

We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because
the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we supposed
the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction-
upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant,
as steady in his resolution for the enterprise as bold in execut-
ing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a
bonnet, with a. bow and arrows, and had provided the same for
himself and his countrymen, that the people, if they saw us,
should not determine who we were. All the first night we
spent in mixing up some combustible matter, with aqua. vitae,
gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; and
havinge good quantity of ter in a. little pot, about an hour
after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least suspicion of danger

.nttending their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the moon
gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same
posture and place that it did before. The people seemed to be
all at their rest; only that in the great hut, where we saw the
three priests, we sew a. light, and going up close to the door,
we heard people talking as if there were five er six of them;
we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol,
these men would come out immediately, and run up'to the
place to rescue it from destruction ; and what to do with them
we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away, and
setting fire to it at a. distance; but when we came to handle

. it, we found it too bulky for our carriage, so we ware at a loss
again. The second Scotsman was for setting fire to the hut,
and knocking the creatures that were there on the head
when they came out; but I could not join with that; I
was against killing them, if it were possible to avoid it.
" Well, then," said the Scots merchant, " I will tell you
what we will do : we will try to make them prisoners,
tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol
destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine or pmkthread enough about
us, which we used to tie our firelocks together with; so we'

unsolved to attack these people first, and with as little noise as5 l2 Ll r 1-: AND ontm'rmws

we could. 'The first thing we did we knocked at the door,
when one of the priests coming to it, we immediately seized
upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind him,
and led him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might
not make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on
the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another
would come out to see what the matter was ; but we waited so
long till the third man came back to us ; and then nobody
coming out, we knocked again gently, and immediately out
came two more, and we served them just in the same manner,
but were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by
the idol some distance from one another; when, going back,
wo found two more were come out of the door, and a third
stood behind them within the door. We seized the two, and
i mmcdiately tied them, when the third, stepping back and cry-
ing out, my Scots merchant went in after them, and taking
out a composition we had made that would only smoke and
stink, he set lire to it, and thinw it in among them. By that
time the other Scotsman and my man, taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by the arm, led
them away to the idol, and left them there, to see if their idol
would relieve them, making hast-e hack to us.

\Vhon the furzo wo had thrown in had filled the hut with
so much smoke that they were almost. saline-ital, we throw in
a, small leather bag of another kind. which flamed like a.
candle, and following it in, We found time were but four
people, who, as we supposed, had been about some of their
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in short, frightened to
death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able
to speak either, for the smoke.

\Ve quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke soon '
drove us out, bound them as we had done the other, and all
without any noise. Then we carried them all together to tho
idol; when we come there, we fell to work with him. First
we daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and
tallow mixed with brimstone ; then we stopped his eyes, and
ears, and mouth full of gunpowder, and wrapped up a great
piece of wildfire in his bonnet; then sticking all the combus-
ti bles we had brought with us upon him, we looked about to
see if we could find anything else to help to burn him; when
or menses causou.- 543

my Scotsman remembered that by the hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage ; away he and the other
Scotsman ran and fetched their arms full of that. When we
had done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them,
having untied their feet and ungsgged their mouths, and made
them stand up, and set them before their monstrous idol, and
then set fire to the whole. a

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, tilil
the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew
up, and, as we could perceive, had split altogether ; and, in a
word, till we saw it burned so that it would soon be quite
consumed. We then began to think of going away ; but the
Scotsman said, " No, we must not go, for these poor deluded
wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn
themselves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till the
forage was burned down too, and then came away and left
them. After the feat was performed, we appeared in the
morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in
getting ready for our journey; nor could any man suppose
that we had been anywhere but in our beds.

But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great
number of the country people to the town gates, and in a most
outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian
governor for the insulting their priests and burning their
great Chem Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertsinskay were at
first in a great consternation, for they said the Tartars were
already no less than thirty thousand strong. The Russian
governor sent out messengers to appease them, assuring them
that he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in
his garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from anybody
there : but if they could let him know who did it, they should
he exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily, that all
the country reverenced the great Chain Chi-Thaungu, who
dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer
violence to his image but some Christian miscreant; and

. they therefore resolved to denounce war against him and

all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and
Christians.

The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have any
cause of war alleged to be given by him, the Czar having
strictly charged him to treat the conquered country with
gentleness, gave them all the good words he could. At last
he told them there was a caravan gone towards Russia
that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had
done them this injury ; and that if they would be satis-
fied with that, he would send after them to inquire into it.
This seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account how
the thing was ; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan
had done it they should make their escape ; but that whether
we had done it or no, we should make all the haste forward
that was possible; and that, in the meantime, he would keep
them in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor: however, when it
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the
matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were least of all
suspected. However, the captain of the caravan for-the time
took the hint that the governor gave us, and we travelled two
days and two nights, without any considerable stop, and then
we lay at a village called Plothus: nor did we make any long
stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, another Mus-
covite colony, and where we expected we should be safe. But
upon the second days' march from Plothus, by the clouds of
dust behind us at a great distance, it was plain we were
pursued. We had entered a vast desert, and had passed by a
great lake called Schanks Oser, when we perceived a large
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake, to the
north, we travelling west. We observed they went away
west, as we did, but had supposed we would have taken that
side of the lake, whereas we very happily took the south side;
and in two days more they disappeared again: for they, be-
lieving we were still before them, pushed on till they came to
the Udda, a very great river when it passes farther north, but
when we came to it we found it narrow and fordahle.

The third day they had either found their mistake, or had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards dusk.
We had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a cone
Venient place for our camp ; for, as we had just entered upon
a desert above five hundred miles over, where we had no towns
to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena,
which we had yet two days' march to; the desert, however,
had some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which,
ran all into the great river Udda ; it was in a narrow strait,
between little but very thick woods, that we pitched our camp
that night, expecting to be attacked before morning. As it
was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in that
desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every night
against them, as against armies of robbers; and it was, there-
fore, no new thing to be pursued. But we had this night a
most advantageous camp; for as we lay between two Woods
with a. little rivulet running just before our front, we could not
be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or rear :
"he took care also to make our front as strong as we could,
by placing our packs, with the camels and horses, all in a. line,
on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in our rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished. They did not come on
like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us.
to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abused
their priests and burned their idol, that they might burn them
with fire ; and upon this, they said, they would go away, and
do us no further harm, otherwise they would destroy us all.
Our men looked very blank at this message, and began to store
at one another to see who looked with the most guilt in their
{noes ; but nobody--was the word--nobody did it. The leader
of the caravan sent word he was well assured that it was not
done by any of our camp ; that we were peamful merchants,
travelling on our business ; that we had done no harm to them
or to any one else ; and that, therefore, they must look further
for the enemies who had injured them, for we were not the
people ; so they desired them not to disturb us, for if they did
we should defend ourselves.

They were for from being satisfied with this for an answer;
and a. great crowd of them mine running down in the morning,
by break of day, to our camp; but seeing us so well posted.
they durst come no further than the brook in our front, where
they stood, in such number as to terrify us very much;
indeed, some spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and
looked at us a while, and then setting up a. great howl, let fly
a. crowd of arrows among us ; but we were well enough
sheltered under our baggage, and I do not remember that one
of us was hurt.

' Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our
u I
right, and expected them on the rear: when a. cunning fellow,
a Cossack of Jarawena, calling to the leader of the caravan,
mid to him, " I will send all these people away to Siheilka."
This was a city four or five days' journey at least to the right,
and rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and
gutting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as
it wore back to Nertsiuskay; after this he takes a greet
'circuit about, and comes directly on the army of the Tartars,
as if he had been sent express to tell them a long story that
the people who had burned the Chain (lhi-Thaungu were gone
to Silieilka, with u. mravan of miscreants. as he called them---
that is to say Christians : and that they had resolved to burn
the god Seal--Lear, belonging to the Tonguses. As this fellow
was himself a Tartar, and perfectly spoke their language, he
counterfeitcd so well that they all believed him, and away they
drove in a violent hurry to Sibeilka. I n loss than three hours
they were entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any
more of (luau, nor whether they wont to Siboilka or no. So
we passed away xafoly on to Jarawona, where there was a
Russian garrison, and there we rested five days.
l"rom this city we had a frightful desert, which held us
twenty-three days' march. "70 furnished ourselves with some
tents hero, for the better accommodating ourselves in the
night; and tho load-or of the caravan procured sixteen waggons
of the country, for carrying our water or provisions, and those
carriages were our defence, every night round our little unnp;
so that had tho 'J'artars appeared, unless they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to have wanted rest again after
this long journey ; for in this desert we neither saw house nor
two, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of the
Sable-hunters, who are all Tartan; of Mogul Taltery, of which
this country is a part ; and they frequently attack small
mrarans. but we saw no numbers of them together. 1
After we had pissed this desert, we came into a. country '
pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and
castlrs, settled by the Czar, with garrisons of stationary
soldiers, to protect the caravans and defend the country: (vainst
the 'l'artars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous
travelling; and his czarish Innjosty has given such strict
orders for tho \\'\~ll guarding the caravans, that, if there are _
any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments of the
garrison are always sent to see the travellers safe from station
to station. Thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots mer-
ohxrnt, who was acquainted with him, ofi'ered us a. guard of
fifty men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next
station.

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to
Europe, we should find the country better inhabited, and the
people more civilised ; but I found myself mistaken in both;
for we had yet the nation of the Tonguses to pass through,
whore we saw the some tokens of paganism and barbarity as
before; only, as they were conquered by the Muscovites, they
woro not so dangerous, but for rudeness of manners, and
idolatry, no people in the world ever went beyond them. They
are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are built of
tho some ; you know not a man from a. woman, neither by the
ruggedness of their countenanccs nor their clothes ; and in the
winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live under-
ground in vaults, which have cavities going from one to
another. If the Torture had their Chain Chi-Thaungu for a.
whole village or country, these had idols in every but and
every cave. This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I
spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half .of it being
another desert, which took us up twelve days' severe unveiling,
without house or tree; and we won: obliged again to can y our
own provisions, as well water as bread. After we were out of
this desert, and had travelled two days, we crime to J enemy,
in M nscovite city, or station, on the great river J enemy, which,
they told us there, parted Europe from Asia.

All the country between the river Oby and the river J anezay ,
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the re
motost of the Tutors. I also found, which I observed to the
Muscovite governors whom I had an opportunity to converse
with, that the poor pagans are not much wiser, or nearer Chris- '
tizuiit-y, for being under the Muscovite government, which
they acknowledged was true enough--but that, as they said,
was none of their business ; that if the Czar expected to con-
vert his Siberian, Tonguso, or Tartar subjects, it should be
done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers; and
they added, with more sincerity than I expected, that it was

-. an 2548 1.1111: AND Anvnu'runm

not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people
Christians as to make them subjects.

l9' rom this river to the Oby we crossed a wild uncultivated
country, barren of people and good management, otherwise it
is in itself a pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are
sent among them from Russia; for this is the country--I
mean on both sides the river Oby--whither the Muscovito
criminals that are not put to death are banished, and from
whence it is next to impossible they should ever get away. I
have nothing material to say of my particular aiiairs till
I came to 'l'obolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I
continued some time on the following iwcount.

\Vo had now been almost seven months on our journey, and
winter b-uan to come on apace; whereupon my partner and
I called a council about our particular all'airs, 111 which we
found it proper, as we euro bound for England, to consider
how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and
reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time, by
which 111cans, indeed, the .ltussians travel more in winter than
they can in summer, as in these sledgos they ale able to r1111
night and day : the snow being fie/.1211. is one universal
covering to nature, by which the hills, Vales. xiv c1 s, and lakes
are all smooth and hard as a stone. and they run upon the
surface, without any regard to what is underneath.

'rui 1 had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this
kind. 1 was bound to l'hwlund not to \loscow, and my
route lay tWo way - 1 either I must no on as the caravan went
till [12.111111 to Jarhl 1w and then go oil west for Narva. and
the Gulf of Finland. and so on to Dantlic, where I might
possibly sell my China cargo to 1Food advantage; or I must
leave the caravan at a little: town on the Dwina from whence
l had but six days by water to Archangel. and from thence
,might be. sure of shipping either to England, Holland, or
"lanIburgh.

New. to go any of these journeys in the winter would have
been prepostmons; for as to hunt/J11, the Baltic would have
been ire/.1111 up, and 1 could not act passage . and to {In by
lam. in LlluM' r-'uuniiies 11.: 1s lar less sale lhau :unong (he
1"."ng 'l'.1rta1s: likewise, as to Archangel in l.)ctohcr, all the
ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow in the
winter, when the ships are gone; so that I could have nothing
but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of pro-
visions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter.
Therefore, upon the whole, 'I thought it much my better way
to lot the caravan go, and make provision to winter where 1
was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty
degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold
winter with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as the country
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent-
company.

I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved
island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague;
on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my
back, and never made any fire but without doors, which was
necessary for dressing my food, 620. Now I had three good
vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to
the feet, and button close to the wrists; and all these lined
with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. As to a warm
house, I must confess I greatly dislike our way in England of
making fires in every room in the house in open chimneys,
which, when the fire was out, always keeps the air in the
room cold as the climate. So I took an apartment in a good
house in the town, and ordered a chimney to be built like a
furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the
funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come
at the fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept
equally warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat baths in
England. By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and yet we.
saw no fire. nor were ever incommoded with smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be,"
possible to meet with good company here, in a country so
barbarous as this--one of the most northernly parts of
Europe. But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy. as I observed before, are all banished, this
city was full of Russian nobleman, gentlemen, soldiers, and
courtiers. Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the old
German Robostiski, and several other persons of note, and
some ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant whom, never-
theless, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance with
several of these gentlemen; and from these, in the long
winter nights in which I stayed here, I received several very
agreeable visits.

It was talking one night with a. 'certain prince, one of the
banished ministers of state belonging to the Czar, that the
discourse of my particular case began. He had been telling
me abundance of fine things of the greatness, the magnifi-
cence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the Emperor

. of the Russians: I interrupted him, and told him I was a
greater and more powerful prince than ever the Czar was,
though my dominion were not so large, or my people so many.
The Russian grandee looked a. little surprised, and, fixing his
eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant. I
said his wonder would cease when I had explained myself,
and told him the story at large of my living in the island;
and then how I managed both myself and the people that
Were under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They
were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially the
prince, who told me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of
life was to be masters of ourselves; that he would not have
exchanged such a state of life as mine, to be Czar of Muscovy;
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed
to be banished to there, than ever he found in the highest
authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar;
that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers
down to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under
the weight of the greatest storms without. \Vhen he came
first hither, he said, he used to tear the hair from his head,
and the clothes from his back, as others had done before
him ; but a little time and consideration had made him look
into himself, as well as round him, to things without: that
he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought to
reflect upon the state of universal life, and how little this
world was concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly capable
of making a. felicity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and
suitable to its own best ends and desires, with but very little

worldly pleasures, he said he was at leisure to look upon the
dark side of them, where he found all manner of deformity;
and was new convinced that virtue only makes a man truly
wise, rich, and great, and preserves him in the way to a
superior happiness in a future state; and in this, he said,
they were more happy in their banishment than all their
enemies were, who had the full possession of all the wealth
and power they had left behind them. "Nor, sir," says he,
" do I bring my mind to this politically, from the necessity,
of my circumstances, which some call miserable; but. if I
know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though
the Czar my master should call me, and reinstate me in all
my former grandeur."

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it
was the true sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt
his sincerity. I told him I once thought myself a kind of
monarch in my old station, of which I had given him an
account ; but that I thought he was not only a monarch, but
a great conqueror ; for he that had got a victory over his
own exorbitant desires, and the absolute dominion over him-
self, he whose reason entirely governs his will, is certainly
gleuter than he that conquers a city. -'

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter
I thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not so much as
1001: abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a kind of
mask of fur before my face, with only a hole for breath, anl
two for sight: the little daylight we had was for three
months not above five hours a day, and six at most; only
that the snow lying on the ground continually, and the
weather being clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses
were kept, or rather starved, under ground; and as for our -
servants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves and
horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to
haw and take care of, lest they should mortify and fall ofif.

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being
close, the walls thick, the windows small, and the glass all
double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and
cured in the season; bread good enough, but baked as biscuits;
dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of
bufialoes, which is pretty goodJneat. All the stores of pro
visions for the winter are laid up in the summer, and well
cured: our drink was water, mixed with aqua vitae instead of
brandy; and for a treat, nziead ins'ead of win: which. hnw-5.3;: LII-'l-l .Ixn .\I>>II..\'I'I'III:.~' or lllllilNh'IIN ('Iursoc.

OBL'HDD rum THI "ll--I'D NOBLNIAN 1'0 "CAPI-
I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a prison
every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle
at Moscow: however, it came into my thoughts that I might
certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of this
excellent person; and that, whatever hazard I ran, I would
certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this, I took an
occasion, one evening, to tell him my thoughts. I represented
to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there
being no guard over him in the country; and as I was not
going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the
retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in
the stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every
night where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to
Archangel, where I would immediately secure him on board
an English ship, and carry him safe along with me 3 and as to
his subsistence and other particulars, it should be my care till
he could better supply himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me
all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very face that
what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his
colour frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart
fluttered, till it might be even perceived in his countenance;
nor could he immediately answer me when I had done, and,
as it were, hesitated what he would say to it: but after he
had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How unhappy
are we, unguarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest
acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made
tempters of one another'l" He then heartily thanked me for
my oil'ers of service, but withstood resolutely the arguments I
used to urge him to set himself free. He declared, in earnest
terms, that he was fully bent on remaining where he was
rather than seek to return to his former miserable greatness,
as he called it; where the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice,
and luxury, might revive, take root, and again overwhelm
him. "Let me remain, dear sir," he said, in conclusion--
"let me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from
the crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at
the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the future
happiness which I now have 'in my view, but should then, I
fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh; a man, a mere
man; and have passions and afiectiom as likely-to possess
and overthrow mo as any man: 0, ho not my friend and
tompter hoth nigotlwr l "

ll 1 was surprised helm-o. l was quito dumb now. and stood
silent. looking at him. and indeed, admiring what l saw. The
struggle in his soul was so great that. though the weather was
extremely cold. it put him into a most violent heat; no I said
u. word or two. that I would lwwo him to cousidor of it, and
wait on him Again, and thou I withdraw to my own npartmont.

About two hours after, 1 hoard somohody at or noar tho
door of my room, and I was going to opou tho door, but he
had opoued it and mum in. " My dour friuud," says ho.
"you had almost oversot me. but l mu romverod. Do not
tuko it ill that. I do not. elose with your offer. .I assure you
it is not for want of souse of tho kiuduoss of it in you; and
I more to make the most sincero acknowledgmont of it to
you; hut l llopo 'l horn got, tho victory over myself."~----" My
lord." said I. " I hope you am fully satisfied that. you do not
resist tho will of ]|e:u'en."--~-"Sir," said he. "if it had been
from lloaveu. tho mime power would have inlluuncod me to
have :weeplod it; but I hopo, :lllll am fully sntixliod. that. it
is from Heaven that l declino it. and I hm-o infinite satisfac-
tion in the parting, that you shall leave mo an honest man
still. though not n. {we man."

I had nothing to do but to acquiesco. and make professions
to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to servo
him. lleoluhrueml mo very Irwsionatoly. mid assured mo ho
was sensihlo of that. and should always m-hnowh'dgo it; and
with that ho oll'erod mo :\ very lino prosent of subles,--->>too
much. indeed. for mo (o not-opt from a mam in his circum-
stunem. and I would have avoided them. but ho would not ho
refused. The nnxt morning I sent my servant to hix lord-
ship with a small present of ton, and two pieces of ('him
damask. and four littlo wedges of Japan gold, which did not
all weigh uhove six ouucos or thermbouts, but wcro far short
of the rnvluo of his saliles, which, when l mum to England, 1
found worth uenr two lmndrod pounds. l-lo mrcopted the ten,
and mm piece of the dnmask. and mm of the pieces of gold,
which had :1. lino stamp upon it. of the Japan coinage. which
I found he took for tho rarity of it, but would not take any

more: and ho sent word by my servant that ho desired to
speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I know what had passed
betwoen us, and hoped 1 would not move him any more in
that all'air ; but that, since I had made such a generous offer
to him, he asked me if I had kindness enough to olfer the
sumo to another person that he would name to me, in whom
he had n. great share of concern. In a word, he told me it
was his only son; who, though I had not seen him, was in the
same condition with himself, and above two hundred miles,
from him, on the other side of tho Oby ; but that, if I con-
sented, he would send for him.

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly
on his account ; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I
would show my respect to him by my concern for his son. He
sent the next day for his son ; and in about twenty days he
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven horses,
loaded with very rich furs, which, in the whole, amounted to
a very great vaiue. His servants brought the horses into the
town, but left the young lord at a distance till night, when he
came incognito into our apartment, and his father presented
him to me; and, in short, we concerted the manner of our
travelling, and everything proper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-
skins, line ermines, and such other furs as are very rich in
that city, in exchange for some of the goods I had brought
from China; in particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which
I sold the greatest part hero, and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better price than I could have got at
London; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and
whose business, more particularly than mine, was merchandise,
was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the trafiio
we made here. . ,

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place:
We were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only'I
thirty-two horses and camels in all, which passed for mine"
though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It
was natural also that I should take more servants with me
than I had before ; and the young lord passed for my steward;
what great man I passed for myself, I know not, neither did
it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst and the
largest desert to pass over that we met with in our whole.
journey; I call it the worst, because the way was very deep in
some places, and ver ' uneven in others; the best we had to
say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of 'l'artars or
robbers to fear, as they never came on this side of the river
()by, or at least very seldom : but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was
perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by private
roads, so that we avoided coming int-o the principal towns and
cities upon the gr at road. such as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy,
and several othe . : lieeause tho Museovite garrisons which are
kept there are very curious and strict in their observation upon
t-'ayellers, and searching lest an}v of the banished persons of
note should make their escape that way into Muscovy ; but, by
this means. as we were kept: out of the cities, so our whole
journey was a desert, and we were. obliged to oncamp and lie
in our tents, when we. might have. had very good accommoda-
tion in the cities on the way; this the young lord was so
sensible. of, (hat he would not allow us to lie abroad when we
canm to seven-.11 cities uh the. way, but lay abroad himself, with
his servant, in the. woods. and met us always at tho appointed
places.

We had just. entered Europe, having: passed the river Kama,
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and
Asia. and the first. city on the European side was called Soloy
Kansaskoyz that is, the great city on the river Kama. And
hero we thought to see some. evident alteration in the people ;
lull; we were mistaken: for as we. had a vast. desert to pass,
whiz-h is near seven hundred miles long in some. places, but not
ahore two hundred miles over whero we passed it, so, till we
came. past that horrible place. we found very little difference
between that country and Mogul Tartary. The people are
mostly Pagans: their houses and towns full of idols; and
their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the. cities and
the *illages near them. where they are ('hristians as they call
themselves. of the Creel; Plum-eh: hut have their re '
mingled with so many relies of superstition. that it is scarce
to be. known in sumo plat-es lrom mere. sorcery and witchcraft.

ln passing this forest (after nil our dangers were. to our
im-'gination. oseaped). 1 thought. iudeod. we must. have been
plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered. by a troop of
thieves: of what country they were 1 am yet at n. lugs to
know; but they were all on hot leback, carried bows and
arrows, and were at first about for by-five in number. They
came so near to us as to be 'within two musket-shot, and,
asking no questions, surrounded us with their horses, and
looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length, they placed
themselves just in our way 5 upon which we drew up in a little

line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all.
'lhus drawn up, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant,
who attended his lord, to see who they were; his master was
the more willing to let him go, because he was not a little
apprehensive that they were a Siberian 13er sent out after
him. The man came up near them with a. flag of truce, and
mlled to them ; but though he spoke several of their languages,
or dialects of languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said ; however, after some signs to him not to come near
them at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he went;
only that bv theird ress, he said, he believed them to be some
Taitars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hoides, and that
them must be more of them upon the great desert, though he
never heard that any of them were seen so far north before.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy
there was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile dis-
tance, a. little grove, and very near the road. I immediately
resolved we should advance to those trees. and fortify ourselves
as well as we could there; for, first, I considered that the
_t1'ees would in a. great measure cover us from their arrows;
and, in the next place, they could not come to chm ge us in a
body : it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed
it, 31111 who had this excellency attending him, that he was
always readiest and most apt to direct and encoui 11ge us in
cases of the most danger. "('0 advanced immediately. with
what speed we could, and gained that little wood ; the Tartars,
or thieves. for we knew not what to call them. keeping their
stand. and not attempting to hinder us. When we came
thither, we found, to our great satisfaction. that it was a
swampy piece of ground, and on the one side a very great
spring of water. which. running out in a little brook, was a
little farther joined by another of the like size; and was, in
short. the source of a considerable river, called afterwards the
\Virtska; the trees which grew about this spring were not
above two hundred, but very large, and stood pretty thick. so
that as soon as we got in, 11o saw ourselves perfectly safe from

they wanted, and bade them keep off ; but they came on with
a double fury up to the wood side, not imagining we Were so
barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old pilot
was our captain, as well as our engineer, and desired us not to
fire upon them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might
be sure to kill, and that when we did fire we should be sure to
take good aim; we bade him give the word of command, which
he delayed so long, that they were some of them within two
'pikes' length of us when we let fly. We aimed so true, that
we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, as
also seveml'of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets apiece at least. '

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated
immediately about one hundred rods from us; in which time
we leaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance,
we sallied out, and caught four or five of their horses, whoso
riders we supposed were killed; and coming up to the dead,
we judged they were Tartar-s, but knew not how they came to
make an excursion such an unusual length.

About an hour after, they again made a. motion to attack us,
and rode round our little wood to see where they might brmk
in; but finding us always ready to face them, they went oll'
again; and we resolved not to stir for that night.

We slept little, but spent the most part of the night in
strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances into
the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight,
and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery
indeed; for the enemy, who we thought were discouraged with
the reception they met with, were now greatly increased, nnd
had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were
resolved to besiege us; and this little camp they had pitched
upon the open plain, about three-quarters of a mile from us.
I confess, I now gave myself over for lost, and all that I had;
the loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though very con-
siderable, as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such
barbarians, at the latter end of my journey, after so many
diiiiculties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in
sight of our port, where we expected safety and deliverance.
As to my partner, he was raging, and declared that to lose his
goods would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than be
starved, and he was for fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, a most nallant youth, was for fighting to

About two hours before night, we set out again, and travelled
till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as
before; and about seven o'clock, we passed a little river,
called Kirtza, and mine to a good large town inhabited by
Russians, called Ozomys ; there we heard that several troops'
of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that we
were now completely out of danger of them, which was to our
great satisfaction. Here we were obliged to get some fresh
horses, and having need enough of rest, we stayed five days;
and my partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian who
conducted us thither the value of ten pistoles.

In five days more we came to Veussima upon the river
Witzogda, and running into the Dwina: we were there, very
happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river being
navigable, in seven days' passage, to Archangel. From hence,
We came to Lawrenskoy, the 3rd of July ; and, providing our-
selves with two luggage boats, and a barge for our own con-
venience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe at
Archangel the 18th; having been a year, five months, and
three days on the journey, including our stay of about eight
months at Tobolski.

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have terried longer, had not a
Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of the
English ships ; when, after some consideration that the city of
Hamburgh might happen to be as good a market for our goods
as London, we all took freight with him ; and, having put our
goods on board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board to take care of them; by which means, my young
lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never
coming on shore again all the time we stayed there ; and this
he did that he might not be seen in the city, where some of
the Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and
discovered him.

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the
same year ; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partnervand
I found a very good sale for our goods, as well those of China,
as the sables, 550. of Siberia: and, dividing the produce, my
share amounted to 3,4761. 17.3. 3d., including about six hundred.
pounds' worth of diamonds, which I purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the
Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved
to seek protection and could correspond with those of his
father's friends who were left alive. He did not part without
testimonials of gratitude for the service I had done him, and
for my kindness to the prince his father.

To conclude : having stayed near four months in Hamburgh,
I came from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked
in the packet, and arrived in London the 10th of January,
1705, having been absent from England ten years and nine
months. And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am
preparing for a. longer journey than all these, having lived
seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, and learned suffi-
ciently to know the value of retirement, and the blessing of
ending our days in peace.
