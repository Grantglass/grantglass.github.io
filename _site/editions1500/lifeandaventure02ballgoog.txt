time there, even to the last moment^ till I had laid 
me down and died, like the old goat, in the cave : 
I had also arrived to some little diversions and 
amusements, which made the time pass more plea^ 
sandy with me a great deal than it did before ; as, 
first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to 
speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so 
articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to 
me; and he lived with me no less than six-and- 
twenty years : how long he might live afterwards 
I knew not; though I know they have a notion in 
the Brazils, that they live an hundred years ; per- 
haps some of my polls may be alive there still, 
calling after poor Robin Crusoe to this day ; I wish 
no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear 
them ; but if he did, he would certainly believe it 
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and 
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen 
years of my time, and then died of mere old age ; 
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, 
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several 
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me, 
and all I had ; but at length, when the two old 
ones I brought with me were gone, and after some 
time continually driving them from me, and letting 
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild 
into the woods, except two or three favourites, 
which I kept tame, and whose young, when they

had any, I always drowned, and these were part of 
my family: besides these, I always kept two or 
three household kids about me, which I taught to 
feed out of my hand ; and I had also more parrots 
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin 
Crusoe, but none like my first ; nor, indeed, did I 
take the pains with any of them that I had done 
with hiin : I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose 
names 1 know not, which I caught upon the shore, 
and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I 
had planted before my castle wall, being now 
grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all 
lived among these low trees, and bred there, which 
was very agreeable to me ; so that, as I said above^ 
I began to be very well contented with the life I 
led, if it might but have been secured from the 
dread of savages. 

But it was otherwise directed ; and it might not 
be amiss for all people, who shall meet with my 
story, to make this just observation from it, viz. 
How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil, 
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, 
when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to 
us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our de- 
liverance, by which alone we can be raised again 
from' the affliction we are fallen into. I could give 
many examples of this in the course of my unac- 
countable life ; but in nothing was it more particu- 



4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

larly remarkable, than in the circumstances of my 
last years of solitary residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said 
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the 
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it> was 
the particular time of my harvest, and required my 
being pretty much abroad in the fields ; when going 
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was 
thorough day-light, I was surprised with ^eing a 
light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance 
from me of about two miles, towards the end of the 
island, where I had observed some savages had 
been, as before; but not on the other side ; but, to 
my great affliction, it was on ipy side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, 
lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more 
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that 
if these savages, in rambling over the island, should 
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works 
and improvements, they would immediately con* 
elude that there were people in the place, and 
would then never give over till they found me 
out. In this extremity I went back directly to my 
castle, pulled up the ladder after me, having made 
all things without look as wild and natural as I 
could« 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6 

)n a posture of defence ; I loaded all my cannon, 
as I called them, that is to say, my muskets, which 
were mounted upon my new fortification, and all 
my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the 
last gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend 
myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to 
pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the 
barbarians ; and in this posture I continued about 
two hours, but began to be mighty impatient for 
intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I 
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting 
in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the 
side of- the hill, where there was a flat place, as I 
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up 
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top 
of the hill ; and pulling out my perspective glass, 
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat 
on my belly on the ground, and began to look for 
the place. I presently found there were no less 
than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire 
they had made ; not to warm them, for they had 
no need of that, the weather being extreme hot ; 
but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous 
diet of human flesh which they had brought with 
them/ whether alive or dead I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the 'shore; and as it was then tide 



6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of ebb« they seemed to me to wait the return of the 
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
what confusion this sight put me into, especially 
seeing them come on my side the island, and so 
near me too ; but when I observed their coming 
must be always with the current of the ebb, I 
began afVerwards to be more sedate in my mind, 
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety 
all the time of tide of flood, if they were not on 
shore before ; and having made this observation, I 
went abroad about my harvest work with the more 
composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the 
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take 
boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away : 
I should have observed, that for an hour and more 
before they went ofl^ they went to dancing, and I 
could easily discern their postures and gestures by 
my glasses : I could only perceive, by my nicest 
observation, that they were stark naked, and had 
not the least covering upon them; but wheth^ 
they were men or women, that I could not distio- 
gpiish. 

As sQon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took 
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistpls at 
my girdle, and my great sword by my side, with- 
out a scabbard ; and with all the speed I was able 
to make, I went away to the hill, where I had di^- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 

covered the first appearance of all. As soon as I 
got thither, which was not less than two hours, (for 
I could not go apace, being so loaded with arms as 
I was,] I perceived there had been three canoes 
more of savages on that place ; and looking out 
further, I saw they were all at sea together, ma- 
king ov£r for the main. 

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially, when 
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of 
horror which the dismal work they had been about 
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and 
part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and de- 
voured by those wretches with merriment and sport. 
I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I 
began now to premeditate the destruction of the 
next that I saw there, let them be who, or how 
many soever. 

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which 
they thus made to this island wer^'not very fre- 
quent; for it was above fifteen months before any 
more of them came on shore there again ; that is 
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or sig- 
nals of them, in all that time ; for as to the rainy 
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at 
least not so far; yet all this while I lived unconoi- 
foii;ably, by reason of the constant apprehensions 
I was in of theircoming upon me by surprise; from 
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is 



S TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

more bitter than the sufiering, especially if there 
is no room to shake off that expectation, or those 
apprehensions. 

During all this time« I was in the murdering 
humoar ; and took up most of my hours, which 
should have been better employed, in contriving 
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very 
next time I should see them ; especially if they 
should be divided, as they were the last time, into 
two parties ; nor did I consider at all, that if I kill- 
ed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still 
the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, 
and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should be 
at length no less a murderer than they were in be- 
ing men-eaters, and perhaps much more so. 

I spent my days now in great perplexity and 
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day 
or other fall injto the hands of those merciless crea- 
tures; if I im at any time venture abroad, it was 
not without looking round me with the greatest 
care and caution imaginable ; and now I found, to 
my great comfort, how happy it was that I had 
provided a tame flock or herd of goats ; for I durst 
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially 
near that side of the island where they usually 
came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if 
they had fled from me now, I was sure to have 
them come back again, with perhaps two or three 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

hundred caaoes with them in a few days, and then 
I knew what to expect. 

However^ I wore out a year and three months 
more before I ever saw any more of the savages^ 
and then I found them again, as I shall soon ob- 
serve. It is true, they might have been there once 
or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at least, 
1 did not hear them ; but in the month of May, as 
near as I could calculate, and in my four and twen- 
tieth year, I had a very strange encounter with 
them, of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fiflteen 
or sixteen months interval, was very great ; I slept 
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
started out of my sleep in the night ; in the day 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind : in the night 
I dreamed often of killing the savages, and the rea- 
sons why I might justify the doing of it But to 
wave all this for a while, it was in the middle of 
May, on the sixteenth day, 1 think, as well as my 
poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked 
all upon the post still ; I say, it was on the sixteenth 
of May, that it blew a great storm of wind all day, 
with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a 
very foul night was after it : I know not what was 
the particular occasion of it ; but as I was reading 
in the Bible, and taken up with serious thoughts 



!• THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

aboat my present condition, I was surprised with 
the noise of a gan, as I thought, fired at sea. 

This was^ to be sure, a surprise of a quite diflfe- 
rent nature from any I had met with before; for 
the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of 
another kind : I started up in the greatest haste im- 
aginable ; and in a trice clapped up my ladder to 
the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me, 
and mounting it the second time, got to the top of 
the hill ; that yery moment a flash of fire bade me 
listen for a second gun, which accordingly in about 
half a moment I heard, and by the sound knew 
that it was from that part of the sea where I was 
driven out with the current in my boat 

I immediately considered that this must be some 
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, 
or some other ship in company, and fired these 
guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help* 
I had this presence of mind at that minute as to 
think, that though I could not help them, it may 
be they might help me; so I brought together all 
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a 
good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill; 
the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though 
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, 
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing 
as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt 
they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up. 



OF ROBINSON CRU80B. II 

heard another gun, and after that several others^ 
all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all 
night long, till day broke; and when it was broad 
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a 
great distance at sei^ full east of the island, whe- 
ther a sail, or an boll, I could not distinguish, no 
not with my glasses, the distance was so great, and 
the weather still something hazy also : at least it 
was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move; so I presently 
concluded that it was a ship at anchor ; and being 
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my 
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east 
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been 
formerly carried away with the current ; and get- 
ting up there, the weather by this time being per- 
fectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, 
the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon 
those concealed rocks which. I found when I was 
ont in my boat; and which rocks, as they check- 
ed the violence of the stream, and made a kind of 
counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my 
recovering then from the most desperate hopeless 
condition that ever I had been in all my life. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's 
destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks

being wholly under water, had been driren upon 
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. 
and K N. K Had they seen the island, as I must 
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, a& I 
thought, haye endeavoured to have saved them- 
selves on shore by the help of their boat ; but the 
firing of their guns for help, especially when they 
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many 
thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon seeing my 
light, they might have put themselves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore; 
but that the sea going very high, they might have 
been cast away ; other times I imagined, that they 
might have lost their boat before, as might be the 
case many ways ; as particularly, by the breaking 
of the sea upon their ship, which maiiy times obliges 
men to stave, or take in pieces their boat; and some- 
times to throw it overboard with their own hands; 
other times I imagined, they had some other ship 
or ships in company, who, upon the signals of dis- 
tress they had made, had taken them up, and car- 
ried them off: other whiles I fancied they were all 
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried 
away by the current that I had been formerly in, 
were carried out into the great ocean, where there 
was nothing but misery and perishing; and that 
perhaps they might by this time think of stalling, 
and of being in a condition to eat one another. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. IS 

All these were but ocmjectures at bett; ao, in the 
condition I was in, I could do no more than look 
upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them; 
which had still this good efifect on my side, that it 
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to 
God, who had so happily and comfortably provi- 
ded for me in my desolate condition; and that of two 
ships companies, who were now cast away upon this 
part of the world, not one life should be spared but 
mine. I learnt here again to observe, that it is 
?ery rare that the providence of Grod casts us into 
any condition of life so low, or any misery so grea^ 
but we may see something or other to be thankful 
for, and may see others in worse circumstances than 
our own. 

Such certainly was the case of these men, of 
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose 
any of them were saved ; nothing could make it 
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they 
did not all perish there, except the possibility only 
of their being taken up by another ship in com* 
pany: and this was bat mere possibility indeed; 
for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any 
such thing. 

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, 
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I 
felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking out some- 
times thus : *' O that there had been but one or 



14 THE LIFE AND ADTENTUftES 

two, nay, but one soul saved out of the ship, to 
have escaped to me, that I might but have had one 
companioti, one fellow-creature to have spoken to 
me, and to have conversed with!" In all the time 
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong 
a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or 
so deep a regret at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the 
affections, which, when they are set a going by 
some object in view, or be it some object though 
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by 
the power of imagination, that motion carries out 
the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager 
embracings of the object, that the absence of it is 
insupportable. 

Such were these earnest wishings, ** That but one 
man had been saved! Othat it had been but one I*' 
I believe I repeated the words, '« O that it had been 
but one !'' a thousand times ; and my desires were 
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my 
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press 
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft 
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun- 
tarily; and my teeth in my head would strike to- 
gether, and set against one another so strong, that 
for some time I could not part them again. 

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the 
reason and manner of them; all I can say of them 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 

is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising 
to me when I found it, though I knew not from 
what it should proceed ; it was doubtless the e£fect 
of atdent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my 
mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation 
of one of my fellow-christians would have been 
to me. 

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, 
or both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being 
on this island, I never knew whether any were sa- 
ved out of that ship, or no ; and had only the af- 
fliction some days after to see the corpse of a drown- 
ed boy come on shore, at the end of the island 
which was next the shipwreck: he had on no 
dothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open- 
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but 
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what 
nation he was of: he had nothing in his pocket 
but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe ; the

first 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-^ 
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but 
I might find something on board that might be 
useful to me ; but that did not altogether press me 
so much, as the possibility that there might be yet 
some living creature on board, whose life I might 
Hot only save, but might, by saving that life, com-

fort my own to the last degree : and this thought 
clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet 
night nor day> but I must venture out in my boat 
on board this wreck; and committing the rest to 
God's providence, I thought the impression was 
so strong upon my mind, that it could not be re- 
sisted, that it must come from some invisible direc- 
tion, and that I should be wanting to myself if I 
did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened 
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my 
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for 
^esh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum,, 
(for I had still a great deal of that left,) a basket 
full of raisins ; and thus loading myself with every 
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the 
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my 
cargo in her, and then went home again for more : 
my second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the 
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another 
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen 
of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than be- 
fore, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all 
which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to 
my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage^ 
I put out, and rowing or paddling the cai)ioe along 
the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the 
island, on that side, viz. N. £. And now I was to

launch out into the ocean> and either to venture, or 
not to venture; I looked on the rapid currents 
which ran constantly on both sides of the island, 
at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, 
from the remembrance of the hazard I had been 
in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I 
foresaw, that if I was driven into either of those 
cuments, I should be carried a vast way out to sea, 
and perfatips out of my reach, or sight of the island 
again; and that then, as my boat was but small, 
if any little gale of wind should rise, I should b^ 
inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I 
began to give over my enterprise; and having hauled 
my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped 
outy and sat me down upon a little spot of rising 
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear 
and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was 
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, 
and the flood came on, upon which my going was 
for so many hours impracticable ; upon this it pre- 
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the 
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, 
if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, 
when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, 
if I was driven one way out, I might not expect to 
be driven another way home, with the same rapids 
ness of the currents. This thought was no sooner

}» my head, bat I cast niy eye i:^n a little bill 
\vhich sujQSciently overlooked the sea both ways, 
fU)d from whenpe I had a clear view of the currents, 
or set9 of the tidfs, and which way I was to gpide 
inys^lf in my return : here I found, that as the cur- 
rent of the ebb set out close by the south point of 
Ibe island, so the current of the flood set in close by 
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing 
to do b^t to keep to t\ke north of the island in my 
fGtqro, and I should do w^ll enough* 

Eqcovt^aged mt\i this observation, I resolved the 
next morning to set out with the first of the tide ; 
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe, 
\)n^er the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launcl^* 
^d out. I made first a little out to sea full north, 
tiU I began to feel the benefit of the current, which 
set e^wa^d# and which carried me at a great rate, 
an<l yet did not so hurry me as the southern side 
9lirf^t h9^d done before, and so as to take fr#m me 
all government of the bo^sit ; but having a strong 
steerage with my paddle, 1 went, I say, at a great 
r^te, directly for the wreck, and in less than two 
hours I capae up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at : the ship, which 

)iy its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed ii^ 

between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of 

ber was beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her 

liurecastlej whi^h stuck in the rocks, had run on 

5 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

with great violence, her maiii^maat and fore-mast 
were broaght by the board, that is to say, broken 
short off, bat her boltspritwas sound, and the head 
and bow appeared firm. ' When I came dose to 
her, a dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me 
coming, yelped and cried, and as soon as I called 
him jumped into the sea to come to me; and I 
took him into the boat, but found him almost dead 
for hunger and thirst : I gave him a cake of ny 
bread, and he ate like a ravenous wolf that hsd 
been starring a fortnight in the snow:. I then gave' 
the poor creature some fresh water,, wkh jf hich, 
if I would have let him, he wonld hare burst him^' 
self. 

After this I went on board. The first sight I 
met with was two men drowned in the cook-roora> 
or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about 
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable^ 
that when the ship stnick, it being in a storm, the 
sea broke so high, and ^k> continually over her, that 
the men were not able to bear it, and Were strange 
led with the constant rushing in of die water, as 
much as if they had been under water. Besides 
the dog, there was nothing left in the ship tluit had 
life, nor any goods that I could see, but what were 
spoiled by the water : there were some casks of 
liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which 
lay lower in the hold, and which, the. water being 



iO THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ebbed ont, I could see ; but they were too big to 
meddle with : I saw several chests, which I belie- 
ved belonged to some of the seamen^ and I got two 
of them into the boat without examining what was 
in them. 

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the 
fore part broken c&, I am persuaded I might have 
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these 
two chests, I had txx>m to suppose the ship had a 
great deal of wealth on board ; and if I may guess by 
the course she steered, she must have been bound 
from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in 
the south part of America, beyond the Brazils, to 
the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so per- 
haps to Spain : she had, no doubt, a great treasure 
in her, but of no use at that time to any body : 
and what became of the rest of her people I then 
knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of 
liquor, of about twenty gallons^ which I got into 
my boat with much difficulty. There were several 
muskets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with 
about four pounds of powder in it : as for the mus- 
kets, I had no occasion for them, so I left theni; 
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and 
tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little 
brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and 
a ^idiroa ; and with this cargo^ and the dog, I

eame away, the tide beginDing to make honle 
agairi ; and the same Qvenrng, about an hour within 
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued 
to the last degree. 

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the 
rooming I resolved to harbour what I had gotten 
in my new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. 
After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on 
shore, and began to examine the particulars ; the 
cask of liquor I fou^nd to be a kind of rum, but not 
such as we had at the Brazils; and, in a word, not 
at all good ; but when I came to open the chests, 
I found several things which I wanted : for exam- 
ple, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an ex- 
traordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, 
fine, and very good ; the bottles held about three 
pints each, and were tipped with silver : I found 
two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so 
fastened also on the top, that the salt water bad 
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which 
the water had spoiled : I found some very good 
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about 
.a dqzen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and 
coloured neckcloths; the former were also. very 
welcome, being exceeding refineshiiig tp wipe my 
face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to 
the till in the chests, I found there three great bags 
ef pieces of eight, which held about eleven hui^dred

fneces in all ; and in one of tliem^ wrapt up in a 
paper, six d6ubloons of goki, and some small bars 
or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh 
near a pound. 

The other chest I Ibund had some clothes in it, 
but of little value ; but by the circumstances, it 
most have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there 
was no'powder in it, but about two pounds <^ glazed 
powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, lor 
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upoo 
the whole, I got very little by this voyage tha^ was- 
of much use to me : ka, as to the money, I had no 
manner of occasion for it ; it was to me as the dirt 
under my feet; and I would have given it all for 
three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, 
which were things I greatly wantedi, bvt had not 
had on my feet now for many years ; I had, indeed, 
got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet 
of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck; 
and I found two pair more in o«e of the chests, 
which were very wekome to me ; but they were 
Bot like our English shoes, either fer ease or service, 
being rather what we call pumps than shoes, i 
found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces of 
eight in royals, but no gold : I suppose this be- 
longed to a poorer man than the other, which seem- 
ed to beloi^ to some officer. 
Well> however, I lugged the money home to my 



OF ROBIN80N CRtSOE. 2& 

cave^ and laid it up, as I had done that before, 
which I brought from our own ship ; but it was 
great pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship 
bad not come to my share, for I am satisfied I 
might have loaded my canoe several times over 
with money, which, if I had ever escaped to Eng- 
land, would have lain here safe enough till I might 
have come again and fetched it 

Having now brought all my thi^ on shore, and 
secured them, I went back to my b6a€, and rowed 
or paddled her along the shore to* her otd harbour, 
where I fciid her up, and mad^ the best of i^y i^ay 
to my old habitation, where I f6Qnd ev^ry thing 
safe and quiet ; so I begaA to r6po^e ^'self, live 
after ntry old fashion, and take 6are of my family 
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough; only 
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked 
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ^ ancf 
if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it wa9 
always to the east part of the ipland, where I was

where I could go withoilt so many precautttins, and

^ould have yentured to sea, boqnd any where, I 
knew not whither. 

I have heen, in all roy circamstances, a memento 
to those whp are touched with that general plagiie 
pf mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half 
of their miseries flow : I mean, that of not being 
aatisfied with the station wherein God and nature 
hath placed them ; for, not to look back upon my 
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my 
father, the opposition to which was, as I may call 
it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the 
same kind have been the means of my coming into 
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, 
which so happily had seated me at the Brasuls sfiB a 
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and could 
I have been contented to have gone on gradually, 
I might have been by this time, I mean in the time 
of my being on this island, one of the most consi- 
derable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuad- 
ed, that by the improvements I had made in that 
little time I lived there, and the increase I should 
probably have made if I had stayed, I might have 
been worth a hundred thousand moidores; and 
what business had I to. leave a settled fortune, welU

so f^^ction tipoQ the fcJIy of it is as ordinarily 
the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bough* 
experience of time ; and so it was with me now )

and possibility of my escape from this place; afttii 
that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader^

my bed or hammock, awake, and very well ia 
health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness 
of body, no, nor any uneanness of mind more than 
ordinary, bnt could by no means close my ey^fls^ 
that is, so as to sleep; no^ not a wink all night 
long; otherwise than as fi^ws : 

It ia as impossible as needless to set down the in-, 
numerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through 
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, 
in this night's time : I ran over the whole history 
of my Ufe in miniature, or by abridgtement, as I may 
call it, to my coming to this island ; and also of 
that part of my life since I came to this island; in 
my reflections upon the state of my case, since I 
came on shore on this island, I was comparing the 
happy posture of my af&irs, in the ftsst years of 
my habitation here, to that coucse of anxiety, fear, 
and care, which I had lired in ever since I had 
seen the print of a foot in the sand; not that I did 
not. belieye the sarages had freqaented the island 
even all the while, and might hav« been several 
hnncfa^edsof them at times on the shore there; but 
as I had nerer known it, and was ineapable of any 
apprehensions about it, my satisfaction was perfect

happy" t» not knowing n»y danger, as if I had neyer 
really been exposed to It : this fori^died ray

thotights with many very profitable reflections, and 
particularly this one: How infinitely good that 
Providence is, which has settled in its government 
of mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and 
knowledge of things ; and though he walks in the 
midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of 
which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind 
and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by 
having the events of things hid from his eyes, 
and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround 
iiim. 

After these thoughts h$ul for some time enter- 
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real 
danger I had been in for so many years in this very 
island ;• and how I had walked about in the greatest 
security, and with all possible tranquillity, even 
perhaps when nothing but a brow on a hill, a great 
tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be- 
tween me and the worst kind of destruction, viz. 
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and sa« 
vages, who would havQ sei2sed on me with the same 
view as I did on a goat or a turtle, and have thought 
it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I 
did of a pigeon or a curlew. I should unjustly 
slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely 
thankfiil to my great Preserver, to whose singular 
protection I acknowledged, with great humility. 
Ijhat all these unknown deliverances were due, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. t9 

without which I should inevitably have fallen into 
their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were overj my head wa9 
for some time taken up in considering the nature 
of these wretched creatures^ I mean, the savages ; 
and how it came to pass in the world, that the wise 
Governor of all things should give up any of his 
creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something 
so much below even brutality itself, as to devour 
its own kind : but as this ended in some (at that 
time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to in* 
quire what part of the world these wretches lived 
in ; how far off the coast was from whence they 
came; what they ventured so far from home for; 
what kind of boats they had; and why I might 
not order myself, and my business so, that I might 
be as able to go over thither, as they were to come 
to me. 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider 
what I should do with myself when I came thither; 
what should become of me if- 1 fell into the hands 
of the savages ; or how I should escape from them« 
if they attempted me ; no, nor so much as how it 
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be 
attacked by some or other of them, without any 
possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not 
fall into tlieir hands, what I should do for provision, 
pr whither I should bend my course: none of these

tiioughta, I say^ so mach as came in my way ; but 
my mind was wholly bent upon the notimi of my 
passing over in my boat to the m^tn land. I look- 
ed back upon my present condition as the moet 
miserable that could possibly be; that I was not 
able to throw myself into any thing but death that 
could be called worse ; that if I reached the shore 
of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with relief; or 
I might coast along, as I did on the shore of Afri- 
ca, till I came to some inhabited country, and 
where I might find some relief; and after all, per* 
baps, I might (all in with some Christian ship that 
might take, me in ; and if the worst came to the 
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to 
«)r these miseries at once. Pray, note, all this was 
the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper^ 
made, as it were, desperate by the long continu** 
ance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had 
met in the wreck I had been on board of, and 
where I had been so near the obtaining of what I 
80 earnestly longed for, viz. somebody to speak to, 
and to learn some knowledge from, oi the place 
where I was, and of the probable means of my de« 
lirerance ; I say, I was agitated wholly by these 
thoughts. All my calm of mind in my resigna- 
tion to ProTidence, and waiting the issue of the dis- 
positions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; 
mild I had, as it were, no power to tarn my thoughts 



or ROBINSON CRUSOK. . 81 

to any thing hot the project of ft voyage to tht 
main ; which came upon me with such force^' and 
Boch an impataosity of desire, that it was not to be 
resisted. 

When this had agitated my thonghts for two 
hours or more, with such Tioleoce, that it set my 
i^ery blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as 
•high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the 
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it; nature^ 
as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the 
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep : 
one would have thought I should have dreamed of 
It; but I did not, nor of any thing relating to it ; 
but I dreamed, that as I was going out in the morn* 
iug, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore 
two canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and 
that they brought with them another savage, whom 
they were going to kill, in order to eat him; when 
on a sudden, the savage that they were going to 
kill jumped away, and ran for his life : then I 
thought in my sleep, that he came running into my 
little thick grove, before my fortification, to hide 
himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not per- 
ceiving that the others sought him that way, sheW'* 
ed myself to him, and, smiling upon him, encoura* 
ged him : that he kneeled down to me, seeming to 
pray me to assist him ; upon which I shewed my 
kdder, made )um go up it, and carried him into 



82 THK LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

my cave, and he became my servant ; and that ns 
soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, " Now 
I may certainly venture to the main land ; for this 
fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me 
what to do, and whither to go fbr provision!^ and 
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what 
places to venture into, and what to escape/' I wa- 
ked with this thought, and was under such inexpres- 
<ible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape in my dream^ that the disappointments 
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding 
it was no more than a dream, were equally extra- 
vagant the other way, and threw me into a very 
great dejection of spirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that 
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape, 
was, if possible, to get a savage in my possession ;, 
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners 
whom they had condemned to be eaten^ and should 
bring hither to kill : but these thoughts still were 
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible 
to effect this, without attacking a whole caravan of 
them, and killing them all ; and this was not only 
a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry; but, 
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law- 
fulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the 
thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was 
for my deliverance : I need not repeat the argu-. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

ments which occurred to me against this, they be^ 
ing the same oientioned before : but though I had 
other reasons to offer now, viz. that those men were 
enemies to my life, and would devour me, if they 
could ; that it was self-preservation, in the highest 
degree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, 
and was acting in my own defence, as much as if 
they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I 
say, though these things argued for it, yet the 
thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliver- 
ance were very terrible to me, and such as I could 
by no means reconcile myself to a great while. 

However, at last, after many secret disputes with 
myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all 
these arguments, one way and another, struggled 
in my head a long time), the eager prevailing de* 
sire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest, 
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these sava^ 
ges into my hands, cost what it would : the next 
thing then was to contrive hovf to do it; and this 
indeed was very difficult to resolve on : but as I 
could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I re- 
solved to put myself upon the watch to see them 
when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the 
event, taking such measures as the opportunity 
should present, let it be what it would. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my- 
self upon the scout as often as possible, and in*

deed so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it 
was above a year and a half that I waited, and for. 
a great part of that time went out to the west end 
and to the south-west comer of the island, almost 
every day, to see the canoes, but none appeared. 
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble 
me much; though I can't say that it did in this 
case, as it had done some time before that, viz. 
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing ; but 
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager 
I was for it : in a word, I was not at first more 
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and 
avoid being seen by thera, than I was now eager 
to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, 
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to 
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I 
should direct them, and to prevent their being able, 
at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a great 
while that I pleased m3rself with this afEiir, but 
nothing still presented ; all my fancies and schemes 
came to nothing, for no savages came near me for 
a great while. 

About a year and a half after I had entertained 
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it 
were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of 
.j^ occasion to put them in execution, 1 was sur- 
prised one morning early, with seeing no less than

broke all my measures ; for seeing so many, and 

knowing that they always came four, or six, or 

sometimes more, in a boat, 1 could not tell what 

to think of it, or how to take any measures to attack 

twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so I lay still 

in my castle, perplexed and discomforted ; however, 

I put myself into all the same postures for an attack 

that I had formerly provided, and was just ready 

for action, if any thing had presented. Having 

waited a good while, listening to hear if they made 

any noise; at length being very impatient, I set 

my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered 

up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual, 

standing, so, however, that my head did not appear 

above Uie hill, so that they could not perceive me 

by any means. Here I observed, by the help of 

my perspective glass, that they were no less than 

thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and 

that they had had meat dressed; how they cooked 

it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were 

al> dancing in 1 know not how many barbarous 

gestures and figures, their own way, ronnd the fire. 

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived, 

by my perspective, two muerable wretches dragged 

from the boats, where, itseem^ they were laid by 



80 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and were now brought out for the slaughter: I 
perceived one of them immediately falU being 
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden 
sword, for that was their way ; and two or three 
others were at work immediately, cutting him open 
for their cookery, while the other yictim was left 
standing by himself, till they should be ready for 
him. In that very moment this poor wretch see« 
ing himself a little at lit>erty, nature inspired him 
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, 
and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, 
directly towards me ; I mean towards that part of 
the coast where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow- 
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way : and 
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued 
by the whole body ; and now I expected that part 
of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would 
certainly take shelter in my grove ; but I could 
not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the 
rest of it, viz. that the other savage would not pur- 
sue him thither, and find him there. However, I 
kept my station, and my spirits began to recover, 
when I found that there were not above thi-ee men 
that followed him ; and still more was I encouraged 
when I found that he outstript them exceedingly 
in running, and gained ground of them; so that if 
he CQwdd but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily 
he would fairly get away from them all. 



OF ROBtNMN CRUSOE. St 

There was between them and my castle the creek, 
whkh I mentioned often at the first part of my 
8tory> when I landed my cargoes out of the ship ; 
and this I knew he must necessarily swim oyer, 
or the poor wretch would be taken there: but 
when the savage escaping came thither^ he made 
nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but 
plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, 
or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding 
strength and swiftness. When the three pursuers 
came to the creek, I found that two of them could 
swim, but the third could not, and that he, standing 
on the other side, looked at the other, but went no 
farther; and soon after went softly back again, 
which, as it happened, was yery well for him in 
the main. 

I observed, that the two who swam were yet more 
than twice as long swimming over the creek than 
the fellow was that fled from them. It came now 
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irre- 
sistibly, that now was my time to get a servant, 
and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I 
was called plainly by Providence to sa vethis poor 
creature's life. I immediately got down the ladders 
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, 
for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I 
observed above; and getting up again with the 
same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards 
the sea ; and having a very short cut, and all down?

hilly clapped myself in tlie way between the pur- 
suers and the pursued^ hallooing aloud to him that 
fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as 
much frighted at me as at them ; but I beckoned 
with my hand to him to come back ; and in the 
mean time I slowly advanced towards the two that 
followed ; then rushiug at once upon the foremost, 
I knocked him down with the stock of my piece ; 
I was loath to fire, because I would not have the 
rest hear, though at that distance it would not have 
been easily heard; and being out of sight of the 
smoke.too, they would not have easily known what 
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down^ 
the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had 
been frightened^ and I advanced apace towards 
him : but as I came nearer, I perceived presently 
he had a bow and arrow, and was fi^ng it to shoot 
at me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him 
first ; which I did, and killed him at the first shot. 
The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though 
he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he 
thought;,) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise 
of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither 
came forward, nor went backward, though he seem- 
ed rather inclined to fly still, than to come on. I 
hallooed again to him, and made signs to come foN 
ward, which he easil^rnmderstood, and came a little 
way, then stopped again, and then a little farther, 
and stopped again ; and I could then perceive, that

he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prison- 
er, and had just been to be killed, as his two ene- 
mies were. I beckoned him again to come to me, 
and gare him all the signs of encouragement that 
I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, 
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token 
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at 
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him 
to come still nearer. At length he came close to 
me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the 
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and 
taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his 
head. This, it seems^ was in token of swearing to 
be my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much 
of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there 
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the sa- 
vage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but 
stunned with the blow, and began to come to him- 
self: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the sa- 
vage, that he was not dead : upon this he spoke 
some words to me ; and though I could not under- 
stand them> yet I thought they were pleasant to 
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's voi^ 
thsA, I had heard, my own excepted, tbr-abose^e- 
and-twenty years. But there was no time lor such 
reflections now : the savage, who was knocked down, 
recovered hio^elf so far as to sit up upon the 



40 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ground ; and I perceived that my savage began to 
be afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented my 
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him : 
upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made 
a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung 
naked in a belt by my side ; so I did : he no sooner 
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow 
cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger- 
many could have done it sooner or better ; which I 
thought very strange for one, who, I had reason to 
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except 
their own wooden swords : however, it seems, as I 
learnt aflerwards, they make their wooden swords 
so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that 
they will cut off heads even with them, nay, and 
arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done 
this, he comes laughing tome in sign of triumph, and 
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance 
of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it 
down, with the head of the savage that he had 
killed, just before me. 

But that which astonished him most was, to 
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off; 
iso pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him 
go to him : so I bade him go, as well as I could. 
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, 
looking at him ; turned him first on one side, then 
on t'other; looked at the wound the bullet had 



ir- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

made, which it seems was just in his breast, where 
it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood 
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he 
was quite dead. Then he took up his bow and 
arrows, and came back : so I turned to go away, and 
beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him 
that more might come after them. 

Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury 
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the 
rest, if they ibilowed ; and so I made signs again to 
him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he 
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big 
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him 
into it, and covered him, and did so also by the 
other ; I believe he had buried them both in a quar- 
ter of an hour : then calling him away, I carried 
him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on 
the farther part of the island ; so I did not let my 
dream come to pass in that part ; viz. that he came 
into my grove for shelter. 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to 
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was 
indeed in gfeat distress for, by his running; and 
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go 
lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had 
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket 
upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself some- 
times; so the poor creature lay down, and went to 
sleep. 



4f THE LIFE AND ADYSNTURES 

He was a comely handsome fellow^ perfectly well 
made^ with straight long limbs, not too large, tall^ 
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six 
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not 
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to baye some- 
thing very manly in his face, and. yet he had all the 
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun- 
tenance too, especially when he smiled : his hair was 
long and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead 
▼ery high and large, and a great yivacity and 
sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his 
skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet 
not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Bra- 
zilians and Virginians, and other natives of America, 
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that 
had in it something very agreeable, though not very 
easy to describe. His ^e was round and plump, 
his nose small, not flat like the Negroe's, a very 
good mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, 
and white as ivory. After he had slumbered, 
rather than slept, about half an hour, he waked 
again, and comes out of the cave to me, for I had 
been milking my goats, which I had in the enclo- 
sure just by : when he espied me, he came running 
to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, 
with all the possible signs of an humble thankful 
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew 
it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4S 

close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his 
head^ as he had done before ; and af^r this^ made 
all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and 
submission imaginable, to let me know how much 
he would serve me as long as he lived. I under- 
stood him in many things, and let him know I was 
very well pleased with him. In a little time I be- 
gan to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; 
and firsts I made him know his name should be 
Friday, which was the day I saved his life ; and 
I called him so for the memory of the. time ; I 
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let 
him know that was to be my name; I likewise 
taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the 
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an 
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, 
and sop my bread in it ; and I gave him a cake of 
bread to do the like, which he quickly complied 
with, and made signs that it was very good for him. 
I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon 
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes: 
at which he seemed very glad, for he «7as stark- 
naked. As we went by the place where he had 
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, 
and shewed me the marks that he had made to find 
them again, making signs to me that we should 
dig them up again, and eat them : at this I ap- 



44 THE LIFE AND ADVENTUAES 

peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, 
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and 
beckoned with my hand to him to come away, 
which he did immediately, with gre t submission. 
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if 
bis enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, 
I looked, and saw plainly the place where they 
bad been, but no appearance of them, or of their 
canoes; so that it was plain that they were gone, 
and had left their two comrades behind them, with- 
out any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery : but 
having now more courage, and consequently more 
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving 
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar- 
rows at his back, which I found he could use very 
dexterously, making him carry one gun for mo^ 
and I two for myself, and away we marched to 
the place where these creatures had been ; for 1 had 
a mind now to get some fuller intelli&nence of them. 
"When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill 
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the 
horror of the spectacle : indeed it was a dreadful 
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made 
nothing of it : the place was covered with humapt 
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces 
of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, 
iind scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4S 

triumphant feast they had been making there, af- 
ter a victory over their enemies. I saw three 
akuUs, five hands, and the bones of three or four 
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the 
bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me under*' 
stand, that they brought over four prisoners to feast 
upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that 
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there 
had been a great battle between them and their 
next ^ing, whose subjects, it seems, he had been 
one of; and that they had taken a great number of 
prisoners^ all which were carried to several places 
by those that had taken them in the flight, in or- 
der to feast upon them, as was done here by these 
wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, 
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them to- 
gether on an heap, and make a great fire upon 
it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had 
still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, 
and was still a cannibal in his nature ; but I dis- 
covered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts 
of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he 
durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, 
let him know that I would kill him if he offered it. 

When we had done this, we came back to our 
castle, and there I fell to work for my man Fri- 
day; and first of all^ I gave him a pair of lin^n^ 



46 THE LIFB AKD ADVENTURES 

drawera, which I had oat of the poor gonnei^s chest 
I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck ; and 
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well ; 
then I made him a jericin of goat's-ekin, as well as 
my skill would allow, and I was now growil' a to- 
leiable good tailor; and I gare him a cap, which I 
had made of a hare-skin, very convenient, and 
fashionable enough : and thus he was dressed^ for 
the preset, tolerably well^ and mighty well was he 
pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his 
master. It is tme, he went awkwardly in these 
things at first; wearing the drawers was very awk-* 
ward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled 
his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a 
little easing them, where he complained they hurt 
him^ and using himself to them, at length he took 
to them very well. 

The next day afier I came home to my hutch 
with him, I began to consider where I should lodge 
him ; and that I might do well for him, and yet be 
perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him 
in the vacant place between my two fortifications^ 
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the 
&rst: and as there was a door or entrance there 
into my cave, I made a formal framed door*case« 
and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the pas- 
sage, a little within the entrance ; and causing the 
door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

nigfaty takisg in my ladders too ; so that Friday 
ooukl no way come at me in the inside of my in« 
nennost wall, without making so much noise in get- 
ting oirer, that it must needs awaken me ; for my 
first wall had now a complete roof oyer it of long 
poles^ covering all my tent, and leaning up to the 
side of the hili, which was again laid cross with 
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over 
a great thickness with the rice straw, which was 
strong like reeds; and at the hole or place. which 
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed 
akind of trap-door, which if it had been attempted 
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but 
would have fallen down, and made a great noise ; 
and 'as to weaponi^ I took them all into my side 
every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never 
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, 
than Friday was to me ; without passions, sullen- 
ness, or designs; perfectly obliging and engaging; 
his very afiectious were tied to me, like those of 
a child to a father; and I dare say, he would hsCve 
sacrificed hb life for the saving mine, upon any oc- 
casion whatsoever : the many testimonies he gave 
me of this put it out of doubt ; and soon convinced 
me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my. 
safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and 
that with wonder, that^ however it had pleased God 



4S THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in his providence, and in the government of the 
works of his hands, to take from so great a parjb of 
the world of his creatures the best uses to which 
their faculties, and the powers of their souls, are 
adapted ; yet that he has bestowed upon them the 
same powers, the same reason, the same affections^ 
the same sentiments of kindness and obligation^ 
the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the 
same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all 
the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, 
that he has given to us ; and that when he pleases 
to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are 
as ready, nay more ready, to apply them to the 
right uses for which they wiere bestowed, than we 
are. And this made me very melancholy some- 
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre- 
sented, hoW mean an use we make of all these, 
even though we have these powers enlightened by 
the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and 
by the knowledge of his word, added to our under- 
standing ; and why it has pleased God to hide the 
like saving knowledge from so many millions of 
souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage^ 
would make a much better use of it than we did. - 
From hence I sometimes was led too far to in- 
vade the sovereignty of Providence ; and, as it were, 
arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of 
4hings, that should bide that light from some, and re- 
^ Tealit to other$>^^hd yet except a like duty from both ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

bat I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with 
this conclusion : first, that we do not know by 
what light and law these should be condemned ; but 
that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of 
his being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not 
be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced to 
absence from himself, it was on account of sinning 
against that light, which, as the scripture says, 
was a law to themselves, and by such Tules as theit. 
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though 
the foundation was not discovered to us : and, se- . 
condly, that still, as we are all clay in the hand of. 
the potter, no vessel could say to him, '' Why hast 
thou formed me thus ?'' 

But to return to my new companion : I was great- 
ly delighted with him, and made it my business to 
teach him every thing that was proper to make 
him usefi]!, handy, and helpful ; but especially to 
make him speak, and understand me when t spake : 
and he was the aptest scholar that ever was ; and 
particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, 
and so pleased when he could but understand me, 
or make me understand him, that it was very plea- 
sant to me to talk to h^m; And now my life be- 
gan to be so easy, that f began to say to myself, 
that could I bat bave been safe from more savages, 
I cared not if I was never to remove from the place 
where I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to 
my castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday 
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the 
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him 
taste other flesh ; so I took him oat with me one 
morning to the woods : I went, indeed, intending to 
kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home 
and dress it ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat 
lying down in the shade, and two young kids sit« 
ting by her. I catched hold of Friday : " Hold/* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

said I, ** stand still;'' and made signs to him not to 
stir. Immediately I presented my piece, shot, and 
killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had at 
a di stance indeed seen me kill the savage his enemy, 
hut did not know, or could imagine how it was done, 
was sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and 
kK>ked so amazed, that I thought he would ^ave 
sunk down : he did not see the kid I had shot at, 
or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waist- 
coat to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found* 
presently thought I was resolved to kill him: for he 
came and kneeled down to me, and embraciog my 
knees, said a great many things I did not under- 
stand ; but I could easily see that his meaning was 
to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found away to convince him, that I would 
do him no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, 
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I 
had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, 
which he did ; and while he was wondering and 
looking to see how the creature was killed, I load- 
ed my gun again, and by and by I saw a great 
fowl* like a hawk, sit upon a tree within shot ; so, 
to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I 
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which 
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been 
ahawk^ I say, pointing to the parrot, and to xny 



52 THE LIFE AND ADVEWTURES 

gan> and to the ground under the parrot, to let him 
see I would make him fall, I made him understand 
that I would shoot and kiU that bird ; accordingly 
I fired, and bid him look, and immediately he saw 
the parrot fall : He stood like one frighted again, 
notwithstanding all that I had said to him; and I 
found he was the more amazed, because he did not 
see me put any thing into the gun; but thought 
there must be sfome wonderful fund of death and 
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, 
bird, or any thing near or far off; for the astonish- 
ment this created in him was such, as could not 
wear off for a bng time ; and I believe, if I would 
have let him, he would have worshipped me and my 
gun : as for the gun itself, he would not so much as 
touch it for several days after; but would speak to 
it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when 
be was by himself; which, as I afterwards learnt of. 
him, was to desire it not to kill him. 

Well : after his astonishment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird, I 
had shot, which he did, but stayed some iiwit ; for 
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a 
good way off from the place where she fell ; how- 
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to 
me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about 
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the 
gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I might 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. ^ 

be ready for aQy other mark that might present ; 
but nothing more offered at that time ; so I brought 
home the kid ; and the same evening I took the skin 
off, and cut it out as well as I could, and having a 
pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the 
tlesh, and made some very good broth : after I had 
begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who 
seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but 
that which was strangest to him, was, to see me 
eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the 
salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his 
own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit 
and sputter at it, washing bis mouth with fresh 
water after it On the other hand, I took some 
meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to 
spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had 
done at the salt ; but it would not do, he would 
never care for salt with meat, or in his broth; at 
least, not a great while, and then but a very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, 
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast- 
ing a piece of the kid : this I did by hanging it be- 
fore the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do 
in England, setting two poles up, one on each side 
of a fire, and one cross on the top, and tying the 
string to the cross stick, letting the meat run con- 
tinually : this Friday admired very much; but 



54 THE LIPE AND ADVENTtTRES 

when he came to taste the flesh, he took so m^ny 
ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could 
not but understand him; and at last he told me 
he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I 
was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some 
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I 
observed before ; and he soon understood how to 
do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what 
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make 
bread of; for after that I let him see me make my 
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday 
was able to do all the work for me, as well as I 
could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that, having two mouths 
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground 
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn, 
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
before, in which Friday not only worked very wil- 
lingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully ; 
and I told him what it was for, that it was for com 
to make more bread, because he was now with me, 
and that I might have enough for him and myself too : 
he appeared very sensible of that part, and let 
me know, that he thought I had much more la- 
bour upon me on his account, than I had for my* 
self, and that he would work the harder for me, if 
I would tell him what to do. 



OF llOBINSON CRUSOE. 16 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led 
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, 
and understand the names of almost every thing I 
had occasion to call for, and of every place I had 
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me ; so that, 
in short, I began now to have some use for my 
tongue again, which indeed I had very little occa- 
sion for before; that is to say, about speech. Be- 
sides the pleasure of talking to him« I had a singu*- 
lar satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple un- 
feigned honesty appeared to me more and more 
every day, and I began really to love the creature ; 
and on his side, I believe, he loved me more than 
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be- 
fore. 

I had a mind once to try if he Imd any hanker- 
ing inclination to his own country again ; and ha- 
ving learnt him English so well, that he could an- 
swer me almost any^ questions, I asked him, whether 
the nation that he belonged to never conquered in 
battle ? At which he smiled and said, '* Yes, yes, ' 
we alvirays fight the better ;'* that is, he meant, al- 
ways get the better in fight ; and so we began the 
following discourse : ** You always - fight the bet- ' 
ter !" said I : ** how came you to be taken prisoner 
then, Friday ?" 

Friday. My nation beat niuch for all that* 



56 THE LIFE A14D ADVENTURES 

Master, How beat ? if your nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken ? 

Friday, They more than my nation in the place 
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me : 
my nation over^beat them in the yonder place, where 
me no was ; there my nation take one, two great 
thousand. 

Master. But why did not yoor side recover you 
from the hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe 
that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your na- 
tion do with the men they take ? Do they carry them 
away, and eat them as these did ? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other 
else place. 

Master. Have you been here with them r 

Friday. Yes. I been here [points to the N. W. 
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side]. 

By this. I understood, that my man Friday had 
formerly been among the savages, who used to come 
on shore on the farther part of the island, on the 
said man-eating occasions that he was now brought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6t 

£)r; and seme tin^ after» when I took the courage 
to carry him to that side, heing the same I former- 
ly mentioned, he. presently knew the place, and told 
me, he was there once when they ate up twenty 
men, two women, and one child : he could not tell 
twenty in English, hut he numbered them by lay- 
ing so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to 
tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces 
what follows ; that after I had had this discourse with 
him, I asked him, how far it was from our island to 
the shore, and whether the canoes were not oAien 
lost; He told me there was no danger, no canoes 
ever lost; but that after a little way out to sea, there 
was a current, and a wind always one way in the 
morning, the other in the afternoon. 

This I understand to be no more than the sets of 
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I aft(;^ - 
wards understood it was occasioned by the great 
draaght and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque ; 
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after- 
wards, our island lay ; and that this land which I 
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great ialandr^ 
Trinidad) on the north point of the mouth of the 
river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about 
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and- 
what nations were near : he told me all he knew 
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked 



1^ THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

him the names of the several nations of his sort of 
people, but could get no other name than Caribs ; 
from whence I easily understood^ that these were 
the CaribeeSy which our maps place on that part 
of America which reaches from the mouth of the 
river Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards to St Mar- 
tha. He told me, that up a great way beyond the 
moon ; that was, beyond the setting of the moon^ 
which must be west firom their country, there 
dwelt white-bearded men, Hke me, and pointed to 
my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and 
that they had killed much mans^ that was his word : 
by which I understood he meant the Spaniards^ 
whose cruelties in America had been spread over 
the whole countries, and were remembered by all 
the nations from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might crane 
from this island, and get among those white men; 
he told me. Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I 
could not understand what he meant by two canoe; 
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant^ 
that i^ ipust be in a large great boat as big as two 
canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish 
with me very well ; and from this time I entertain- 
ed some hopes, that one time or other I might find 
an opportunity to make my escape from this place, 
and that this poor savage might be a means to help 
ine to do it. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 59 

Doting the long time that Friday had now been 
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and un<* 
derstand me, I was not wanting to lay a foun- 
datioD of religious knowledge in his mind ; parti-> 
calarly I asked him one time. Who made him ? The 
poor creature did not understand me at all, but 
thought I had asked who was his father : but I took 
it by another handle, and asked him, Who made 
the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills and 
woods ? He told me it was one old Benamuckee, 
that lived beyond all : he could describe nothing of 
this great person, but that he was very old ; much 
older he said, than the sea or the land, than the 
moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old 
person had made all things, why did not all things 
worship him ? He looked very grave, and, with a 
perfect look of innocence, said. All things said O ! 
to him. I asked him if the people who die in his 
country, went away any where ? He said. Yes, they 
all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him, 
whether those they eat up went thither too? he 
said. Yes. 

From these things I began to instruct him in the 
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the 
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up 
towards heaven; that he governs the world by the 
same power and providence by which he made it ; 
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for 



eo THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

usy give every thing to us, take every thing from 
Hs : and thus^ by degrees, I opened hb eyes. He 
listened with great attention* and received with 
pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to re- 
deem us, and of the manner of making our prayers 
to God, and his being able to hear us, even into 
heaven : he told me one day, that if our God could 
hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater 
God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little 
way ofl^ and yet could not hear, till they went up 
to the great mountains, where he dwelt to speak to 
him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak 
to him ? He said. No, they never went that were 
yolmg men ; none went thither but the old men ; 
whom he called their Oowookakee ; that is, as I made 
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and 
that they went to say O ! (so he called saying, 
prayers,) and then came back, and told them what 
Benamuckee said* By this I observed, that there 
ia priestcraft even amongst the most blind^ igno- 
rant Pagans in the world ; and the policy of making • 
a secret of religion, in order to preserve the venera^ 
tion of the people to the clergy, is not only to be 
found in the Roman, but perhaps among all religi- 
ons in the world, even among the noost brutish and 
barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
Priday ; and told him, that the pretence of their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 

•Id men going up to the mountains to say O ! to 
their god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their 
bringing word from thence what he said, was much 
more so ; that if they met with any answer, or 
sp<^ whh any one there, it must be with an evil 
spirit: and then I entered into a long discourse 
with him about the devil, the original of him, his 
rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the rea- 
son of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of 
the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as 
God, and the many stratagems he made use of, t^ 
delude mankind to their ruin ; how he had a secret 
access to our passions and to our affections, to adapt 
his snares so to our inclinations, as to cause us even 
to be our own tempters, and to run upon our own 
destruction by our own choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions 
nn his mind about the devil, as it was about the 
being of a God : nature assisted all my arguments 
to evidence to him even the necessity of a great 
First Cause, and over-ruling governing Power, a 
secret directing Providence, and of the equity and 
justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and 
the like : but there appeared nothing of all this in 
the notion of an evil spirit, of his original, his being, 
his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do 
evil, and to draw us in to do so too : and the poor 
<9:eature puzzled me once in such a manner, by % 



eS THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce 
knew what to say to him. I had been talking a 
great deal to him of the power of God, his omnipo- 
tence, his dreadful aversion to sin, his being a con- 
suming fire to the. workers of iniquity; how, as he 
had made us all, he could destroy us, and all the 
world in a moment ; and he listened with great seri- 
ousness to me all the while. 

After this, I had been telling him how the devil 
was God*s enemy in the hearts of men, and used 
all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs 
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in 
the world, and the like : « Well," says Friday, " but 
you say God is so strong, so great, is he not much 
strong, much might as the devil ?""-*•<« Yes, yes," 
said I, '' Friday, God is stronger than the devil, 
God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to 
God to tread him under our feet, and enable us 
to resist his temptationg, and quench his fiery 
darts." — " But," says he again, " if God much 
strong, much might, as the devil, why God not kill 
the devil, so make him no more wicked ?" 

I was strangely surprised at his question ; and, 
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was 
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a 
casuist, or a solver of difficulties : and, at first,' I 
could not tell what to say ; so I pretended not to 
hear him, and asked him what he said ? bt^t he was 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOB.. ' «S, 

too earnest for an answer to forget his question ; so 
that he repeated it in the very same broken words^ 
as above. By this time I had recovered my- 
self a little, and I said, " €rod will at last punish him 
severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to 
be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever- 
lasting fire. This did not satisfy Friday ; but he 
returns upon me, repeating my words, " Reserve at 
last ! me no understand : but why not kill the devil 
now, not kill great ago }" — " You may as well ask 
me/' said I, ^' why God does not kill you and me, 
when we do wicked things here that ofiend him : 
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned.'' He 
muses a while at this; ''Well, well,'' says he, 
mighty affectionately, "that well ; so you, I, devil, 
all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.'^ 
Here I was run down again by him to the last de- 
gree and it was a testimony to me, how the mere no- 
tions of nature, though they will guide reasonable 
creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship 
or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the 
consequence of our nature; yet nothing but divine 
revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, 
and of a redemption purchased for us ; of a Medi- 
ator; of a new covenant; and of an Intercessor at 
the footstool of God's throne ; I say, nothing but a 
revelation from Heaven can form these in the soul ; 
and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Svfiy 



64 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

oar Jesus Christ, I mean the word of God, and the 
Spirit of God, promised for the guide aud sanctifier 
of his people, are the absolutely necessary instruc- 
tors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of 
God, and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse be-* 
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon 
some sudden occasion of going out ; then sending 
him for sonrefhing a great way off, I seriously 
prayed to God, that he would enable me to in- 
struct savingly this poor savage, assisting, by his 
Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to 
receive the light of the knowledge of God in Christy 
reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to 
speak so to him from the word of God, as his con* 
science might be convinced, his eyes opened, and 
his soul saved. When he came; again to me, I 
entered into a long discourse with him upon the 
subject of the' redemption of man by the Saviour of 
the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel preach- 
ed from Heaven, viz. of the repentance towards 
God, and faith in our blessed Loni Jesus : I then 

I 

explained to him, as well as I could, why our bles- 
sed Redemeer took not on him the nature of angels, 
but the seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason, 
the fallen angels had no share in the redemption ; 
&at he came only to the lost sheep of the house of 
Israel, and the like. 

13 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. «5 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than know* 
ledge, in all the methods I took for this'poor crea- 
ture's instruction ; and must acknowledge, what I 
helieve all that act upon the same principle will 
find, that in laying things open to him, I really In- 
formed and instructed myself in many things that 
either I did not know, or had not fully considered 
hefore ; but which occurred naturally to my mind, 
upon my searching into them for the information 
of thvs poor savage; and I had more aflfection in 
my inquiry after things upon this occasion, than 
ever I felt before ; so that whether this poor wild 
wretch was the better for me or no, I had great 
reason to be thankful that ever he came to me : my 
grief sat lighter upon me, my habitation grew com- 
fortable to me beyond measure; and when I re- 
flected, that in this solitary life, which I had been 
confined to, I had not only been moyed myself to 
look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that 
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in- 
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and, 
for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and 
bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and 
of the Christian doctrine, that he might know 
Christ Jesus, to know whom is lifo eternal ; I say, 
when I reflected uponall these things, a secret joy 
ran through every part of my soul, and I frequent- 
ly rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, 

VOL. II. E 



66 THE LIFE ASD ADVENTURES 

which I had often thought the most dreadful of all 
afflictions that could possibly have befallen me. 

In this thankful frame I continued all the re- 
mainder of my time ; and the conversation which 
employed the hours between Friday and me was 
8Qch« as made the three years which we lived tha« 
together perfectly and completely happy, if any 
such thing as complete happiness can be found in 
a sublunary state. The savage vras now a good 
Chrisjtian, a much better than I ; though I have 
reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were 
equally penitent, and comforted restored penitents : 
we had here the word of God to read, and no far- 
ther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we had 
been in England. 

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, 
and to let him know as well as I could the mean- 
ing of what I read; and he again, by his serious 
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before, 
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge, 
than I should ever have been by my owp private 
reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from ob- 
serving here also from experience, in this retired 
part of my life ; viz. how infinite and inexpressible 
a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God, and of 
the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so 
plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to 
be received and understood, that as the bare read- 

4 



OF ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 67 

ing the Scripture made me capable of understand* 
ing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to 
the great work of sincere repentance for my sins> 
and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation^ 
to a stated reformation of practice* and obedience 
to all God's commands* and this without any teacher 
or instructor (I mean* human) ; so the plain instruc- 
tion sufficiently served to the enlightening this sa- 
vage creature* and bringing him to be such a Chris- 
tain* as I have known few equal to him in my life. 

As to the disputes* wrangUngS* strife* and con- 
tention* which has happened in the world about 
religion* whether niceties in doctrines* or schemes 
of church-government* they were all perfectly use- 
less to us* as* for aught I can yet see* they have 
been to all the rest in the world : we had the sure 
guide to heaven* viz. the word of God-; and we 
had* blessed be God ! comfortable views of the 
Spirit of God* teaching and instructing us by his 
word* leading -us into all truth* and making us 
both willing and obedient to the instruction of his 
word; and t cannot see the least use that the 
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in reli- 
gion* which have made such confusions in the 
World* would have been to us* if we could have ob- 
tained it. But I must go on with the historical part 
of things* and take every part jn its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 



00 THE UFK AND ADVENTURES 

quainted, and that he could dnderstand almost all 

1 said to him> aad speak fluently, though in broken 
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own 
story, or at least so much of it as related to my co* 
ming into the place, how I had lived there, and 
how long : I let him into the mystery (for such it 
was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and taught 
him how to shoot : I gave him a knife, which he 
was wonderfully delighted with ; and I made him 
a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in England 
we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a 
hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only 
as good a weapon in some cases, but much more use* 
ful upon many occasions. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, and 
particularly England, which I came from; how we 
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to 
one another, and how we traded in fthi^sto all the 
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the 
Wreck which I had been on board gf, and shewed 
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ) 
but she was all beaten in pieces long before^ and 
quite gone. 

I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we 
lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir 
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen 
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday 
stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I 



^ OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

asked him what it was he studied upon ? At last, 
says he> " Me see such hoat like come to place at 
my nation/' 

I did not understand him a good while ; but at 
last, when I had examined farther into it, I under- 
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, 
came on shore upon the country where he lived ; 
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by 
stress of weather. J presently imagined that some 
European ship must have been cast away upon 
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive 
ashore ; but was so duU, that I never once thought 
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much 
less whence they might come ; so I only inquired 
after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; 
but brought me better to understand him, when he 
added, with some warmth, " We save the white 
mans from drown/' Then I presently asked him, 
if there were any white mans, as he called them, 
in the boat ? '' Yes," he said, *' the boat full of white 
mans." I asked him, how many ? he told upon his 
fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what became 
of them ? he told me, ** They live, they dwell at 
my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head again ; for 
I presently imagined, that these might be the men 
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of 



TO THE LIFE AND ADVENTUKES 

my island, as I now call it; and who> after the 
ship was stnick on the rock, and they saw her ine* 
vitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and 
were landed upon that wild shore among the sa- 
vages. 

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, 
what was become of them ? He assured me they. ^ 
lived still there, that they h^d been there about 
four years, that the savages let them alone, and 
gave them victuals to live. I asked him how it 
came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? 
He said, " No, they make brother with them :*' 
that is, as I understood him, a truce : and then he 
added, ** They eat no mans but when make the 
war fight :" that is to say, they never eat any men, 
but such as come to fight with them, and are taken 
in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that 
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the 
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear 
day discovered the main or continent of America.; 
Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very 
earnestly towards the main land, and in a kind of 
surprise falls a-jumping and dancing, and calls out 
to me, for I was at some distance from him : I ask^ 
ed him what was the matter ? " O joy V* says he, 
'* O glad ! there see my country, there my na- 
tion !" 



OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. n 

I observed an esctiaordioary sense of pleasure 
appeared in his face, and.hiseyes sparkled, and hit 
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he 
had a mind to be in his own country again; ftnd 
this observation of mine put a great many thoughts 
into me; which made me at first not so easy about 
my new man Friday as I was before ; and I made 
no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his 
own nation again, he would not only forget all his 
religion, but all his obligations to me; and would 
be forward enough to give his countrymen an a&> 
count of me, and come back, perhaps^ with an bun* 
dred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at 
which he might be as merry as he used to be with 
those of his enemies, when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very 
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards : how- 
ever, as my jeakrasy increased, and held me some 
weeks, I was a little more circumspect and not so 
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I 
was certainly in the wrong too, the honest grateful 
creature having no thought about it, but what con* 
sisted of the best principles, both as a religious 
Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared af« 
terwards to my full satisfaction. 

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be 
sure I was every day pumping him, to see if he 
would discover any of the new thoughts whiicdi J 



n THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

laspected were in him ; but I foond every thing be 
•aid was so honest and to innocent, that I could 
find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite 
of dli my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely 
his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that 
I was uneasy; and therefore I could not suspect 
him of deceit 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea- 
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the 
continent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do 
not you wish yourself in your own country, your 
own. nation ?"— " Yes," he said, " I be much O 
glad to be at my own nation.''—'' What would you 
do there }** said I : '' would you turn wild againji 
eat men's flesh again, and be a savage as yuu were 
before ?" He looked full of concern, and shaking 
his head, said, '' No, no, Friday^tell them to live 
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat 
corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. 
^— " Why then,'^ said I to him, '* they will kill you. 
He looked grave at that, and then said, " No, 
they no kill me, they willing love learn :" he meant 
by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, 
they learned much of the bearded mans that came 
in the boat Then I asked him if he would go 
back to thera ? He smiled at that, and told me he 
could not swim so far. I told him I would make 
•a canoe for |iim. He told me he would ^o, if I 



9» 



OF BOBINSOK CRUSOE. IS 

would go with him. " I go !" said I, " why, they 
will eat me if I come there/' — " No, no,'' says he, 
" me make them no eat you, me make they ranch 
lote you :" he meant he would tell them how I had 
killed his enemies and saved his life, and so he would 
make them love me. Then he told me, as well as 
he could, how kind they were to seventeen white 
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came 
on shore in distress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to ven- 
tttie over, and see if I could pos^blyjoin with these 
bearded men, who, I made no doubt were Spa- 
niards or Portuguese ; not doubting but, if I could, 
we might find some method to escape from thence, 
being upon the continent, and a good company 
together, better than I could from an island forty 
miles off the shore, and alone without help. So, 
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by 
way of discourse ; and told him, I would give him 
a boat to go back to his own nation ; and accord- 
ingly I carried him to my frigate, wMch lay on 
the other side of the island ; and having cleared it 
of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water), 
I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went 
into it. 

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at mana- 
ging it, would make it go almost as swift and fast 
again as I could ; so when he w^^ in I said to him. 



r4 THE LIFJB AND ADVENTURES 

^ Well now, Friday, shall we go to your nation ?** 
He looked very dull at my saying so, which it 
seems, was because he thought, the boat too small 
to go so far. i told him then I bad a bigger; so the 
next day I went to the place where the first boal 
lay which I had made, but which I could not gel 
into the water; he said that was big enough; but 
tben> as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain 
two or three and twenty years there, the sun had 
split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. 
Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and 
would carry " much enough vittle^ drink, bread :^* 
that was his way of talking.

the words several times, " why send Friday home 
away to my nation ?"— " Why," said I, " Friday, 
did you not say you wished you were there ?"*^ 
^ Yes yes,*' says he, *' wish be both there ; no 
iwish Friday there, no master there/' In a wor4, 
he would not think of going there without me. ''I 
go there, Friday !*' said I ; '' what should I do 
there?" He turned very quick upon me at this; 
'* You do great deal much good," says he ; *' you 
teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; you 
tell them know God, pray God, and live new life/' 
— *' Alas, Friday," said I, ** thou knowest not what 
thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself."— 
•* Yes, yes," says he, '* you teechee me good, you 
teeciiee them good." — '' No, no, Friday," said I, 
^ you shall go without me ; leave me here to live 
by myself, as I did before." He looked confused 
jigain at that word, and running to one of the 
katcbets which he used to wear, he takes it up has- 
tily, and gives it me. " What must I do with this?" 
'Said I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. 
" What must I kill you for?" said I again. He 
returns very quick, " What you send Friday away 
for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This 
he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his 
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the ut- 
most aflection in him to mp, and a firm resolution 
in him, that I told him then, and often afler, that I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSO&. 7T 

would never send him away from me^ if he was will- 
ing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse 
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should 
part him from me» so I found all the foundation of 
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his 
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my 
doing them good ; a thing which, as 1 had no no- 
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or in- 
tention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I 
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es- 
cape, as above, founded on the supposition gather-* 
ed from the former discourse; viz. that there were 
seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore, with- 
out any delay> I went to work with Friday, to find 
out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large 
periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage : there 
were trees enough in the island to have built a 
little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes only, but 
even of good large vessels : but the main thing [ 
looked at, was to get one so near the water, that we 
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the 
mistake I committed at first 

At last Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found 
he knew much better than I what kind of wood was 
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood 
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the 



78 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Kicaragna wood, for it was much of the same co- 
lour and smell. Friday was for burning the hoU 
low or cayity of this tree out, to make it into a 
boat : but I shewed him how rather to cut it out 
with tools, which after I shewed him how to use, he 
did very handily; and in about a month's hard la- 
bour we finished it, and made it very handsome, 
especially when, with our axes, which I shewed 
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside 
into the true shape of a boat; after this, however, 
it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along; 
as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the 
water ; but when she was in, she would have car* 
ried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was 
so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, 
and how swift, my man Friday could manage her, 
turn her, and paddie her along; so I asked him if 
he would, and if we might, venture over in her? 
" Yes,*' he said, " he venture over in her very well, 
though great blow wind/' However, I had a far- 
ther design that he knew nothing of, and that was, 
to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an an- 
chor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy 
enough to get ; so I pitched upon a straight young 
cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which 
there was a great plenty of in the island ; and I set 
Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him direc* 



•OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. t» 

lions how to shape and order it : but as to the sail, 
that was my particular care ; I knew I had old sails, 
or rather pieces of old sails enough ; but as I had 
had them now twenty-six years by me, and had 
not been very careful to preserve them, not ima^- 
gining that I should ever have this kind of use for 
them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten ; and 
indeed most of them were so; however, I found 
two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with 
these I went to work, and with a great deal of 
pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be 
sure) for want of needles, I at length made a threes 
cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England 
a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bot- 
tom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usu- 
ally our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I 
best knew how to manage ; because it was such a 
one as I used in the boat in which I made my es* 
cape from Barbary, as related in the first part of 
B^y story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, 
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I 
finished them very complete, making a small stay, 
and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should 
turn to windward ; and, which was more than all, 
I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with ; 
and though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as 
I knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a 



so THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

things I applied myself with so much pains to dm 
it, that at last I brought it to pass« though, consi- 
dering the many dull contrivances I had for it that 
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as 
making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to Jthe navigation of ihy 
boat ; for though he knew very^vell how to paddle 
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail 
and a nidder, and was the more apidzed when he 
saw me work the boat to and again in the: sea by 
the rudder, and how the sail gibed/ and filled this 
way or that way,. as the course we sailed changed; 
I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonish- 
ed and amazed : however, with a little use; I made 
all these things familiar to him, and he became an 
expert sailor, except that as to the compass I could 
make him understand very little of that: on the 
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, 
and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there 
was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars 
were always to be seen by night, and the shore by 
day, except in the rainy seasons ; and then nobody 
cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven*and-twentieth 
year of my captivity in this place; though the 
three last years that I had this creature with me, 
ought rathef to be left out pf the account, my ha-.

bitation being quite of another kind than in all the 
rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my 
landing here with the same thankfulness to God for 
his mercies as at first ; and if I had such cause of 
acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, 
having such additional testimonies of the care of 
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of 
being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had 
an invincible impression upon my thoughts, that 
my delvierance was at hand, and that I should not 
be another year in this place. However, I went 
on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and fen- 
cing, as usual ; I gathered and cured my grapes, 
and did every necessary thing, as before. 

The rainy season was in the mean time upon 
me, when I kept more within doors than at other 
times ; so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as 
we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as 
1 said in the beginning, I landed my rafls from the 
ship; and hauling her up to the shore, at high-wa- 
ter mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, 
just big enough for her to float in ; and then, when 
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the 
end of it, to keep the water out ; and so she lay 
dry, as to the tide, from the sea ; and to keep the 
rain of!^ we laid a great many boughs of trees so 
thick, that she was as well thatched as a house ; 
and thus we n^^aited for the months of November

and Decembef, in which I designed te make my 
adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the 
thought of my design returned with the fair weather, 
I was preparing daily for. the yoyage; and the first 
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of pro- 
vision, being the store for the voyage ; and intend- 
ed, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the 
dock, and launch out our boat I was busy one 
morning upon something of this kind, when I called 
to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see 
if he could find a turtle or tortoise ; a thing which 
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the 
eggs, as well as the fiesh. Friday had not been 
long gone, when he came running back, and flew 
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt 
. not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and 
before I had time to speak to him, he cried out to 
me, " O master ! O master ! O sorrow ! O bad ! — 
" What's the matter, Friday !" said I. « O yon- 
der there," says he, " one, two, three, canoe ! one, 
two, three !" By this way of speaking, I concluded 
there were six ; but on inquiry I found there were 
but three. *' Well, Friday," said I, " do not be 
frighted ;" so I heartened him up as well as I could. 
However, I saw the poor fellow most terribly scared ; 
for nothing ran in his head but that they were 
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces* 
11 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 83 

and eat him ; the poor fellow trembled so, that I 
scarce knew what to do with him; I comforted him 
as well as I could, and told hiin, I was in as .much 
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well 
as him. '' But,'' said I, '' Friday, we must resolye 
to fight them : can you fight, Friday }*' — " Me 
shoot," says he, ** but there come many great num- 
ber."—*' No, matter for that," said I again ; " our 
guns will fi-ight them that we do not kill." So I 
asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he 
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as 
I bade him ? He said, '' Me die, when you bid die, 
master ;" so I went and fetched a good dram of rum, 
and gave him ; for £ had been so good a husband 
of my rum, that I had a great deal left When he 
had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pie- 
ces which we always carried, and load them with- 
large swan-shot as big as small pistoUbullets; then 
I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs 
and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I 
loaded with a brace of bullets each : I hung my 
great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave - 
Friday his hatchet. 

When 1 had thus prepared myself, I took my 
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the 
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found 
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and- 
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes^; 



64 THB LIFE AKD ADVENTUilES 

and that their whole business seemed to be the 
triumphant banquet upon these three himian bo- 
dies; a barbarous feast indeed^ but nothing more 
than> as I. had observed^ was usual with them. 

I observed also> that they were landed> not where 
they had done when Friday made his escape, but 
nearer to my creek* where the shore was low* and 
where a thick wood came close almost down to the 

* 

sea : this* with the abhorrence of the inhuman er^ 
rand these wretches came about* so filled me with 
indignation* that I came down again to Friday* and 
told him* I was resolved to go down to them* and 
kill them ail; and asked him if he would stand by 
me. He was now gotten over his fright* and his 
spirits being a little raised with the dram I had 
given him* he was very cheerful; and told me* as 
before* he would die when I bid die. 

In this fit of furv* I took first and divided the 

to 

arms* which I had charg^d^ as before* between us : 
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle* and 
three guns upon his shoulder ; and I took one pis* 
tol* and the other three, myself ; and in this posture 
we marched out. I took a small bottle of mm in 
my pocket* and gave Friday a large bag with more 
powder and btdlet ; and as to others* I charged him 
to keep close behind me* and not to stir, shoot* or 
do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean time* 
xu>t to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a 



01^ R0BIK50K CRUSOE. 85 

compiiss lo my right hand of near a mile> as well to 
get over the creek as to get into the wood; so that 
I might come within shot of them before I could 
be discoreredj which I had seen by my glass it was 
easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former 
thoughts retumingi I began to abate my resolution ; 
I do not mean, that I entertained any fear of their 
number ; for as the}^ were naked, unarmed wretches, 
it is certain I was superior to them ; nay, though I 
had been alone: but it occurred to my thoughts, 
what call, what occasion^ much less what necessity, 
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack 
people who had neither done or intended me any 
wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whose 
barbarous customs were their own disaster, being 
in them a token indeed of God's having left them, 
with the other nations of that part of the world, to 
such stupidity and to such inhuman courses ; but 
did not call me to take upon me to be a judge 
of their actions, much less an executioner of his jus- 
tice ; that whenever he thought fit, he would take 
the cause into his own hands, and by national ven- 
geance punish them for national crimes ; but that 
in the mean time, it was none of my business ; that 
it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was 
a declared enemy, and in a state of war with 
those very particular people, and i^was lawful fqr 



8« THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

him to attack them ;• bat I coilld not say the same 
with respect to me. These things were so warmly 
pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that 
I resolved I would only go place myself near them« 
that I might observe their barbarous feast, and thai 
I would act then as God should direct; but that 
unless something offered that was more a call to 
me than yet I knew of, I would not middle with 

them* 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with 

all possible wariness and silence (Friday following 

close at my heels) I marched till I came to the skirt 

of the wood, on the side which was next to them; 

only that one corner of the wood lay between m^ 

and them : here I called softly to Friday, and shew*- 

ing him a great tree, which was just at the comer 

of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring 

me word if he could see there plainly what they 

were doing ; he did so, and came immediately back 

to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed 

there; that they were all about the fire, eating the 

flesh of one of their prisoners ; and that another lay 

bound upon the sand, a little. from them, whom he 

said they would kill next, and which fired the very 

soul within me. He told me, it was not one of their 

nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had 

told me of, who came to their country in the boat 

J was filled with horror at the very naming the 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S.7 

wbite-bearded man, and, going to the tree, I saw 
plainly by my glass, a white man, who )ay upon 
the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet 
tied with flags, or things like rushes; and that he 
was an European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket be- 
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the 
place where I was, which, by going a little way 
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and 
that then I should be within half-shot of them ; so 
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enra- 
ged to the highest degree ; and going back about 
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which 
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and 
then I came to a little rising*ground, which gave 
me a full view of them, at the distance of about 
eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose ; for nineteen 
of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all 
close huddled together, and had just sent the other 
two to butcher the poor christian, and bring him, 
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire ; and they were 
stooped down to untie, the bands at his feet. I 
turned to Friday ; " Now, Friday,'* 9aid I, " do as 
I bid thee." Friday said he would. *' Then, Fri- 
day,*' said I, " do exactly as you see me do ; fail in 
nothing;'' So I set down one of the muskets aqd 
the fowling-piece upon the ground,, and Fridsiy dkl

the like by his ; aod with the other musket I took 
my aim at the savages, bidding him do the like. 
Then asking him if he was ready, he said ** Yes.'' 
— *' Then fire at them/' said I; and the same mo- 
ment I fired aUo. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that 
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and 
wounded three more; and on my side, I killed 
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be 
sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them^ 
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im - 
mediately, but dfd not know which way to run, or 
which way to look ; for they knew not from whence 
their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close 
upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe 
what I did ; so as soon as the first shot was made» 
I threw down thjB piece, and tppk up the fowling** 
piece, and Friday did the like ; he sees me cock and 
present ; he did the same again.* *' Are you readvi 
Friday," ? said I. " Yes," says he. "Let fly then," 
said I, *' in the name of God ;*' and with that I 
fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did 
Friday ; and as our pieces were now loaden with 
what I called swan-shot, or small "pistol-bullets, 
we found only two drop ; but so many were wound* 
ed, that they ran about yelling and screaming like

most of them; whereof three more fell quickly 
after, though not quite dead. 

*' Now, Fndzy" said I, laying down the dis- 
charged pieces and taking up the musket, which 
was yet loaden, ^ follow me/* said I ; which he 
did, with a deal of courage; upon which I rushed 
out of the wood, and shewed myself, and Friday 
close at my foot : as soon as I perceived they saw 
me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday 
do so ioo ; and running as fast as I could, which 
hy the way was not ^'ery fast, being loaded with 
arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor vic- 
tim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach or 
shore, between the place where they sat and the 
sea ; the two botchers who were just going to work 
with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first 
fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the i^ea-side, 
and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of 
the rest made the same way : I turned to Friday, 
and bade him step forwards, and fire at them ; he 
understood me, immediatel3% and running about 
forty yards to be near them, he shot at themi and 
I thought he had killed them all ; for I saw then) 
all fall on an heap into the boat; though I saw two 
of them up again quickly : however, he killed two 
of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay 
down in the bottom of the boat^ as if l^e had been 
dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out 



90 THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor 
victim; and loosing his hands and feet I lifted him 
up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what 
he was ? he answered in Latin, Cftristianus ; but was 
8o weak and faint, that he could scarce stand, or 
speak ; I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave 
it him, making signs that he should drink; which 
he did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate ; 
then 1 asked him what countryman he was ? and he 
said Espagnole ; and, being a little recovered, let me 
know, by all the signs he could possibly make^ 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. 
'< Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could 
make up, " we will talk aften^'ards, but we must 
fight now : if you have any strength left, take this 
pistol and sword, and lay about you :" he took them 
very thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in 
his hands, "but as if they had put new vigour ' into 
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had 
cut two of them in pieces in an instant ; for the 
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the 
poor creatures were so much frighted with the noise 
of our pieces, that they fell down for mere amaze- 
ment and fear, and had no more power to attempt their 
own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot; 
and that was the case of those five that Friday 
9hot in the boat; for as three of them fell with thq 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9t 

liurt they received^ so the other two fell with the 
fright 

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I 
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I 
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree 
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there, that had been discharged, which he did 
with great swiftness ; and then giving him my mus- 
ket, I satdovm myself to load all the rest again, and 
bade them come to me when they wanted. While 
I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce 
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the 
savages, who made at him with one of their great 
.wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have 
killed him before, if I had not prevented it : the 
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave* as could 
be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian 
a good while, and had cut him two great wound.s on 
his head ; but the savage, being a stout lusty fellow, 
closing in with him, had thrown him down (being 
faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand, 
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit- 
ting his sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot 
the savage through the body, and killed him upon 
the spot, before I, who was running to help, could 
come near him. 

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the 
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his 



n THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three> 
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with ; and 
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him 
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the savages^ and wounded them both ; but 
«s he was not able to run, they both got from him 
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and kil- 
led one of them ; but the other was too nimble for 
him ; and though he was wounded, yet he plunged 
into the sea, and swam with all his might off to 
those who were left in the canoe ; which three in the 
canoe, with one wounded, who we know not whether 
he died or know, were all that escaped our hands 
of one-and-twenty. The account of the rest is as 
follows :

OF R0BIN30K CRUSOE. «IS 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get 
out of gun-shot ; and though Friday made two or 
three shot at them> I did not find that he hit any of 
them : Friday would fain have had me take one of 
their canoes, and pursue them ; and indeed I was 
Tery anxious about their escape ; least, carrying the 
news home to their people, they should come back, 
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, 
and devour us by mere multitudes ; so I consented 
to pursue them by sea ; and running to one of their 
canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me; 
but when I was in the canOe, I was surprised to find 
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand 
and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, 
and almost dead with fear, not knowing what 
the matter was; for he had not been able to look up 
over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck 
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had 
really little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which 
they had bound him with, and would have helped him 
up ; but he could not stand or speak, but groaned 
most piteously, believing, it seems still, that he was 
only unbound in order to be killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling 
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a 
dram, which, with the news of his being deliverect 



94 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when 
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his 
face. It would have moved any one to tears, to have 
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, dan- 
ced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat 
his own face and head, and then sung and jumped 
about again like a distracted creature. It was a 
good while before I could make him speak to me, 
or tell me what was the matter ; but when he came 
a little to himself, he told me that it was his father. 

It was not easy ibr me to express how it moved 
me, to see what exstacy and filial afiection had 
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his fa- 
ther, and of his being delivered from death ; nor in- 
deed can I describe half the extravagancies of his 
afiection after this ; for he went into the boat and 
out of the boat a great many times : when he went 
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his 
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom, 
half an hour together to nourish it: then he took his 
arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff with 
the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
hands;, and I perceiving what the case was, gave 
him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, 
which did them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the ca- 
noe with the other savages, who were now gotten 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

-tlmost out of sight ; and it was bappy for us that 
we did not; for it blew so hard within two hours 
after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of 
their ^vay, and continued blowing so hard all 
night, and that from the north-west, which was 
against them, that I could not suppose their boat 
could live, or that they ever reached to their own 
coast. 

But to return to Friday : he was so busy about 
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take 
him off for some time ; but after I thought he could 
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came 
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 
extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his 
father any bread ? He shook his head, and said, 
** None : ugly dog eat all up self." So I gave him 
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on 
purpose ; I also gave him a dram for himself, but 
he would not taste it, but carried it to his father : 
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of 
my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his 
father. - He had no sooner given his father these 
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and 
run away as if he had been bewitched. He ran 
at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of his 
feet that ever I saw)^^I say he ran at such a rate, 
that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; 
and though I called and hallooed too alter him, it 



90 THX LIFE AKD ADVBlfrURES 

was all one ; away he wenty and in a quarter of an 
hour I saw him come back agaia» though not so fast 
as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his 
pace was slacker/ because he had something in his 
hand. 

When became up to me, I found he had been quite 
home for an earthen jug, or pot» to bring his father 
some fresh water; and that he had^ot two more 
cakes, or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, 
but the water he carried to his father : however, 
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it : 
this water revived his father more than all the ram 
or spirits I had given him; for he was just fainting 
with thirst 

When his father had drank, I called him, to know 
if there was any water left? he said " Yes;'' and 
I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in 
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of 
the cakes that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, 
who was indeed very weak, and was reposing him- 
self upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, 
and whose limbs were also very sti£l> and very 
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been 
tied with : when I saw that upon Friday's coming 
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and 
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, 
and gave hiii;! a handful of raisins : he looked up in 
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thank«

fulness that could appear ia any coonleBance ; but 
was so weaki notwithstanding he hadso exerted him- 
self in the fight, that he could not stand upon his 
feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was 
really not able, his ancles were so swelled and so 
painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused 
Friday to rub his ancles, and bathe them with rum, 
as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate oreature every 
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was 
here, turned his head about, to see if his fether was 
in the same place and posture as he left him sit- 
ting; and at last he found he was not to be seen; 
at which he started up, and, without speaking a 
word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could 
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he 
went : but when he came, he only found he had 
laid himself down to ease his limbs : so Friday came 
back to me presently, and I then spoke to the 
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, 
and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry 
him to our dwelling, where I would take care of 
him : but Friday, a lusty youug fellow, took the 
Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him 
away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the 
side or gumiel of the canoe, with his feet in the in- 
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him 
close to his father, and presently stepping out again,

laanched the boat ofS and paddled it along the 
shore faster than I could walk» though the wind 
blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both 
safe into our creek ; and leaving them in the boat, 
runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed 
me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went ? 
He told me» ** Go fetch more boat ;'' so away he 
went, like the wind; for sure never man or horse 
ran like him, and he had the other canoe in the 
creek almost as soon as I got to it by land ; so 
he wafted me over, and then went to help our new; 
guests out of the boat, which he did ; but they were 
neither of them able to walk ; so that poor Friday 
knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, 
and callmg to Friday to bid them sit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of 
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car- 
ried them up both together upon it between us ; 
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or 
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before ; 
for it was impossible to get them over ; and I was 
resolved not to break it down : so I set to work 
again ; and Friday and I, in about two hours time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with o)d sails, 
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the 
space without our outward fence, and between that 
and the grove of young wood which I had planted : 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 90 

Afid here we made two beds of such things as I 
had ; viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid up- 
on it to lie on, and another to cover them on each 
bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought my- 
self yery rich in subjects ; and it was a merry re- 
flection which I frequently made, how like a king 
I looked : first of all, the whole country was my 
own mere property ; so that I had an undoubted 
right of dominion ; 2dly» My people were perfect- 
ly subjected: I was absolute lord and lawgiver; 
they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to 
lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for 
it, for me : it was remarkable too, I had but three 
subjects, and they were of three different religions. 
My man Friday was a Protestant, his father a Pagan 
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: 
however, I allowed liberty of conscience through^ 
out my dominions : but this by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued 
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to 
rest them upon, I began to think of making some 
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I or- 
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid 
and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed : 
then I cut ofi^the hind quarter, and, chopping it in- 
to small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and 
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure

yon, of flesh and brot^; haying pot ^me barley 
and rice also into the broth ; and as I cooked it 
withovt doors (for I made no fire within my inner 
wall), so I carried it all into the new tent ; and ha- 
ying set a table there^for them, I sat down and ate 
my dinner also with them ; and, as well as I could, 
cheered them and encovragisd them, Friday being 
my interpreter, especially to his father, and indeed 
to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the 
langoage of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and letch 
our muskets and other fire-arms, fvhtch, for want of 
time, we had left upon the place of battle ; and the 
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, 
and would presently be offensive; and I also- or- 
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their bar- 
barous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and 
which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I 
could not bear to see them, if I went that way : all 
which he punctually performed, and defaced the 
▼ery appearance of the savages being there ; so that 
when I went again, I could scarce know where it 
was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood 
pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation 
with my two new subjects; and first I set FridKy 



OF ROBINSON CRVSOK. 191 

to inqaire of his father^ what he thought of the 
escape of the sarages in that caaoe ? and whither 
he might expect a retorn of them with a power 
too great for us to resist ? His first opiaton was» 
that the savages in the boat never coald live out 
the storm which Uew that night they went off, but 
must of necessity be drowned or driven south to 
those other shores, where they were as sure to be 
devoured, as they were to be drowned if they were 
cast away ; but as to what they would do if they 
came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but it 
was his opiniou, that they were so dreadfully fright* 
ed with the manner of being attacked, the noise, 
and the fire, that he believed they would tell their 
people they were all killed by thunder and light- 
ning, and not by the hand of man ; and that the 
two which appeared (viz. Friday and 1) were two 
heavenly spirits or furies come down to destroy 
them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, 
he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in 
their language to one another ; for it was impossi- 
ble for them to conceive that a man should dart 
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, with- 
out lifting up the hand, as was done now. And 
this old savage was in tne right; for as I un- 
derstood since by other hands, the savages of that 
part never attempted to go over to the island after- 
wards. They were so terrified with the accounts 



lOS TUB LIFE AMD ADVENTURES 

giTen by these four men (for it seems they did 
escape the sea), that they believed, whoerer went 
to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with 
fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was un- 
der continual apprehensions for a good while, and 
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army ; 
for as there were now four of us, I would have ven- 
tured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open 
field at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appear- 
ing, the fear of their coming wore off; and I began 
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the 
main into consideration, being likewise assured by 
Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage 
firom their nation on his account, if I would go.

J3uT my thoughts were a little suspeoded, when I 
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when 
I understood, that there were sixteen more of his 
countrymen aad Portuguese, who having been cast 
away, and made their escape to that side, lived 
there at peace indeed with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for 
life : I asked him all the particulars of their voyage; 
and found they were a Spanish ship> bound from 



104 TH£ LIFE AND ADVEirrURES 

the Rio de la Plata to the Hayanna^ being direct- n 

ed to leave their loading there^ which was chiefly « 

hides and silver, and to bring back what European ^ 

goods they could meet with there ; that they had five )i 

Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out v 

of another wreck ; that five of their own men were ij 

drowned when first the ship was lost; and that « 

these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, u 

and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast, i 

where they expected to have been devoured every i 

luoment. i 

He told me, they had some arms with them, but 
they were perfectly useless ; for that they had neither 
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having 
spoiled all their powder, but a little which they 
used at their first landing to provide themselves 
some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of 
them there ; and if they had formed no design of 
making any escape ? He said, they had many con- 
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, or provisions of any kind, 
their counsels always ended in tears and despair. 

I asked him, how he thought they would receive 
> proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
escape ; and whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done ? I told him with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 106 

siy life ia their hands ; for that gratitude was no 
inherent virtue in the nature of man ; nor did men 
always square their dealings by the obligations they 
had receivedj so much as they did by the advanta- 
ges they expected: I told him, it would be very 
hard, that I should be the instrument of their de- 
livefaacot and that they should afterwards make 
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an English- 
man was certain to be made a sacrifice, what neces- 
sity, or what accident soever, brought him thither ; 
and that I had rather be delivered up to the sa^ 
vages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the merci- 
less claws of the priests, and be carried into the In- 
quisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if 
they were all here, we might, with so many hands, 
build a bark large enough to carry us all away 
either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands 
or Spanish coast northward : hot that if in requital 
they should, when I had put weapons into their 
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I 
might be ill used for my kindness to them, and 
make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and 
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, 
and that they were so sensible of it, that he belie- 
Ted they would abhor the thought of using any man 
unkindly that should contribute to their deliver- 
ance ; and that, if 1 pleased, he would go to them 
with the old man, and discourse with them about

it» and return again« and bring me their answer r 
that he wcmld make conditions with them upon their 
solemn oath, that they would be absolutely under 
my leading, as their commander and captain ; and 
that they should swear upon the holy Sacraments 
and Gospel, to be true to me, and go to such Chris- 
tian country as I should agree to, and no other; 
and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my 
orders, till they were landed safely in such coun- 
try as I intended ; and that he would bring a 
contract from them under their hands for that pur- 
pose. 

Then he told me, he would first swear to me him- 
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he 
lived, till I gave him order ; and that he would take 
my side to the last drop of blood, if there should 
happen the least breach of faith among his country- 
men. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil 
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis- 
tress imaginable, having neither weapons or clothes^ 
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of 
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to 
their own country ; and that he was sure, if I 
would undertake their relief, they would live and 
die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to 
relieve them if possible, and to send the old savage

ahd this Spaniard o^er to them to treat : but when 
he had gottea all things in readiness to go, the 
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had 
so much pnidence in it on one hand, and so much 
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be 
very well satisfied in it; and, by his adyice, put off 
the deliyerance of his comrades for at least half a 
year. The case was this : 

He had been with us now about a month ; du« 
ring which time I had let him see in what manner 
I had proTided, with the assistance of Providence, 
for my support ; and he saw evidently what stock 
of corn and rice I had laid up ; which, as it was 
more than sufficient for myself, so it was not suffi- 
cient, at least without good husbandry, for my fa- 
mily, now it was increased to number four : but 
much less would it be sufficient, if his countrymen, 
who were, as he said, fourt een still alive, should 
come over ; and least of all would it be sufficient to 
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a 
voyage to any of the Christian colonies of Ameri- 
ca. So he told me, he thought it would be more 
advisable, to let him and the other two dig and 
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare 
seed to sow; and that we should wait another har- 
vest, that we might have a supply of corn for his 
countrymen when they should come; for want 
might be a temptatioa to them to disagree, or not

to think themselves delivered, otherwiBe than out of 
one diffictdty into another : *' Yen know," says he, 
*' the chiklren of Israel, though they rqoiced at 
first at their being delivered out of Egypt, yet re* 
belled even against God himself, that deliveredl 
them, when they came to want bread in the wilder- 
ness." 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice bo 
good, that I could not but be very well pleased 
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his 
fidelity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as 
well as the wooden toob we were furnished witb 
permitted ; and in about a month's time, by the 
end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten as 
much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed 
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars 
of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we bad tQ 
spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley 
sufficient for our own food for the six months that 
we had to expect oar crop, that is to say, reckoUf- 
ing from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; 
for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the 
ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number 
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the sava* 
ges, if they had come, unless their number had 
been very great, we went freely all over the island, 
wherever we found occasion ; and as here we had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 100 

tMir escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was 
impossible, at least for me, to hare the means of it 
tat of mine ; to this purpose, I marked out several 
tteeSy which I thought fit for our work, and I set 
Friday and his father to cutting them down ; and 
thea I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted 
tny thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct 
their work : I shewed them with what indefatigable 
{»ins I had hewed a large tree into single planks, 
and I caused them to do the like, till they had 
made about a do2en large planks of good oak, near 
two fioet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two 
inches to four inches thick : what prodigious labour 
k took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time I contrived to increase my 
fittle flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and 
(o this purpose 1 made Friday and the Spaniard to 
got out one day, and myself with Friday the next 
day, fof we took our turns : and by this means we 
got about twenty young kids to breed up with the 
rest ; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the 
kids, and ad<)ed them to our flock: but above all, 
€he season for curing the grapes coming on, I cau- 
sed such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in 
the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, 
where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should 
have filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with 
^ur bread, was a great part of our food, and very 



110 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

good liviog tooj I dMure yoa; for it is an exceed* 
ing nourishiDg food. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; 
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in 
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer 
our end ; for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we 
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and 
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the 
rice, which was store enough for our food to the 
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had 
been on shore with me ; or, if we had been ready 
for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victual- 
ed our ship, to have carried us to auy part of the 
world, that is to say, of America. When we had 
thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we 
fell to work to make more wicker-work; viz. great 
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard 
was very handy and dexterous at this part, and 
often blamed me, that I did not make some things 
for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need 
of it. And now having a full supply of food for 
all the guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave 
to go over to the main, to see what he could do 
with those he left behind him there : I gave him a 
strict charge in writing not to bring any man with 
him, who would not first swear, in the presence of 
himself and of the old savage, that he would no 
way injure, fight with, or attack the person h^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

thauld find in the island, who was so kind to send 
for them, in order to their deliverance; but that 
they would stand by and defend him against all 
such attempts ; and wherever they went, would be 
entirely under, and subjected to his command ; and 
that this should be put in writing, and signed with 
their hands : how we were to have this done, when 
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was 
a question which we never asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the 
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in 
one of the canoes, which they might be said to 
come in, or rather were brought in, when they came 
as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. 

I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on 
it, and al^out eight charges of powder and ball, 
charging them to be very good husbands of both, 
and not to use either of them but upon urgent oc* 
casions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first mea^ 
sures used by me in view of my deliverance for 
now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave 
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, suf* 
ficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient 
for their countrymen for about eight days time; 
and wishing them a good voyage, I let them go, 
agreeing with them about a signal they should 
hang out at their return, by which I should know

them agaio^ when they came back, at a 
before they came on shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day . 
that the moon was at the fall ; by ray account ia 
the month of October; but as for the exact reckon- 
ing of days, after I had once lost it, I could never 
recover it again ; nor had I kept even the number 
of years so punctually, as to be sure that I waa 
right, though, as it proved when I afterwards exa^ 
mined my account, I found I had kept a true reck- 
oning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I waited for 
them, when a strange and unforeseen accident in« 
tervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been 
heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch 
one morning, when my man Friday came running 
in to me, and called aloud, ^ Master, master, they 
are come, they are come.'' 

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went 
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through 
ray little grove, which (by the way) was by this 
time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, regardless 
of danger, I went without my arms, which was not 
my custom to do ; but I was surprised, when, turn- 
ing my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at 
about a league and a halPs distance, standing in 
£br the shore, with a shoulder of mutton sail, aa 
they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to

bring them in. Also I observed presently, that 
they did not come from that side which the shore 
lay on, but from the southernmost end of the 
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him 
lie close, for these were not the people we looked 
for, and that we did not know yet whether they 
were friends or enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec- 
tive-glass, to see what I could make of them ; and 
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the 
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre- 
hensive of any thing,, and to take my view the 
plainer without being discovered. 

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my 
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, 
at about two leagues and a half's distance from me, 
S. S. £. but not above a league and a half from the 
shore. By my observation it appeared plainly to 
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an 
English long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though 
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had rea- 
son to believe was manned by my own country- 
men, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot 
describe ; but yet I had some secret doubts hung 
about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, 
bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first 
place, it occurred to me to consider wjiat business 

YOL. IK H 



114 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

an English ship could have in that part of the 
world; since it was not the way to or from any 
part of the world where the English had any traf- 
fic; and I knew there had heen no storms to drive 
them in there, as in distress; and that if they were 
English really, it was most probable that they 
were here* upon no good design ; and that I had 
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands 
of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices 
of danger which sometimes are given him when he 
may think there is no possibility of its being real. 
That such hints an^ notices are given us, I believe 
few that have made any observation of things can 
deny ; that they are certain discoveries of an invi- 
sible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot 
. doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to 
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they 
are from some friendly agent, (whether supreme, or 
inferior and subordinate, is not the question,) and 
that they are given for our good ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in 
the justice of this reasoning ; for had I not been 
made cautious by this secret admonition, come 
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, 
. and in a far worse condition than before, as you will 
see presently. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but 

10 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 115 

I saw the boat draw near the shore> as if they 
looked for a creek to thrust in at for the conye* 
nience of landing; however, as they did not come 
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet 
where I formerly landed my rafts* but nm their 
boat on shore upon the beach^ at about half a mile 
from me, which was very happy for me; for other- 
wise they would have landed just, as I may say, at 
my door, and would have soon beaten me out of 
my castle, and, perhajps, have plundered me of all 
I had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied 
they were Englishmen, at least most of them ; one 
or two 1 thought were Dutch, but it did not prove 
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three 
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought) 
bound ; and when the first four or five of them were 
jomped on shore, they took those three out of the 
boat as prisoners : one of the three I could per- 
ceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, 
affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extrava- 
gance; the other two, I could perceive, lifled up 
their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned in- 
deed, but not to such a degree as the first 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and 
knew not what the meaning of it should be ; Fri- 
day called out to me in English, as well as he 
could, ** O master ! you see English mans eat pri- 



ItO THE UFE ASD ADVENTURES 

soners as well as savage mans.'''—'' Why/' said 1/ 
'< Friday, do you think they are going to eat them 
then?"—" Yes/' says Friday, '* they will eat 
them. '' No, no/' said I, " Friday ; I am afraid 
they will murder them indeed ; but you may be. 
sure they will not eat them/' 

All this while I had no thought of what the mat- 
ter really was, but stood trembling with the horror 
of the sight, expecting every moment when the 
three prisoners should be killed ; nay, once I saw 
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cut- 
lass (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one 
of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall 
every moment, at which all the blood in my body 
seemed to run chill in my veins. 

I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the 
savage that was gone with him ; or that I had any 
way to have come undiscovered within shot of 
them, that I might have rescued the three men ; 
for I saw no fire-arms they had among them ; but 
it fell out to my mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of 
the three men by ^e insolent seamen, I observed 
the fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they 
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that 
the three other men had liberty to go where they 
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 117 

ground very pensiye^ and looked like men in de- 
spair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I 
came on shore^ and began to look about me; how 
I gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked 
round me, what dreadful apprehensions I hsA, and 
how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being 
devoured by wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I 
was to receive by the providential driving of the 
ship nearer the land, by the storms and tides, by 
which I have since been so long nourished and 
supported ; so these three poor desolate men knew 
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply 
they were, how near it was to them, and how ef- 
fectually and really they were in a condition of 
safety, at the same time they thought themselves 
lost, and their case desperate. 

So little do we see before us in the world, and 
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon 
the great Maker of the world, that he does not 
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that 
in the worst circumstances they have always some- 
thing to be thankfulifor, and sometimes are nearer 
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even 
brought to their deliverance by the means by 
which they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high water when these 



lis THK LIFE AND ADVBNTURES 

people came on shore, and while partly they stood 
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and 
partly while they rambled about to see what kind 
of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till 
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed consi* 
derably away, leaving their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I 
found aderwards, having drank a little too much 
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking 
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast 
aground for him to stir it, hallooe^^for the rest who 
were straggling about, upon wl|^ they all soon 
came to the boat; but it was past all their strength 
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the 
shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost 
like a quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, 
perhaps, the least of ^11 mankind given to fore- 
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled 
about the country again; and I heard one of them 
say aloud to another (calling them off from the 
boat), " Why, let her alone. Jack, can't ye ? she'll 
float next tide/' By which I was fully confirmed 
in the main inquiry, of what countrymen they 
were. 

All this while I kept myself close, not once da- 
ring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to 
my place of observation, near the top of the hill ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

and very glad I was» to think how well it was for- 
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat could be on float again, and by that 
time it would be dark, and I might be more at li- 
berty to see their motionsj and to hear their dis- 
course, if they had any. 

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, 
as before, though with more caution, knowing 1 
had to do with another kind of enemy than I had 
at first : I ordered Friday also, whom I had made 
an excellent marksman with his gun, to load him- 
self with arms : I took myself two fowling-pieces, 
and I gave him three muskets. My figure, in- 
deed, was very fierce ; I had my formidable goat- 
skin coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a 
naked sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun 
upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have 
made any attempt till it was dark ; but about two 
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in 
short they were all gone straggling into the woods, 
and, as I thought, were all laid dovm.to sleep.. 
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their 
condition to get any sleep, were however set down 
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter 
of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight 
of any of the rest» 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them. 



IfiO TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and learn something of their condition. Inimedi« 
ately I marched in the figure above, my man Fri- 
day at a good distance behind me> as formidable 
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a 
spectre-like figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, 
and then, before any of them saw me, I called 
aloud to them in Spanish, '' What are ye, gentle- 
men r 

They started up at the noise, but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the un- 
couth figure that I made : they made no answer at 
all, but I thought I perceived them just going to 
fly from me, when I spoke to them in English : 
*'' Gentlemen,'' said I, " do not be surprised at me ; 
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you 
did not expect it." " He must be sent directly 
from Heaven then," said one of them very gravely 
to me, pulling off his hat at the same time, *' for 
our condition is past the help of man. " All help 
is from Heaven, Sir," said I : " but can you put 
a strauger in the way how to help you ? For you 
seem to me to be in some great distress : I saw 
you when 3'ou landed ; and when you seemed to 
make application to the brutes that came with you, 
I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, return- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ul 

ed^ '' Am. I talking to God or man ? Is it a real man> 
or an angel?'' — " Be in no fear about that. Sir/' 
said I : ''if God had sent an angel to relieve you, 
he would have come better clothed, and armed 
after another manner than you see me in ; pray 
lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, 
and disposed to assist you ; you see I have one ser- 
vant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us 
fieely can we serve you ? What is your case ?" 

" Our case," said he, " Sir, is too long to tell 
you, while our murderers are so near ; but in short. 
Sir, I was commander of that ship; my men ha- 
ving mutinied against me, they have been hardly 
prevailed on not to murder me, and at last have 
set me on shore in this desolate place, with these 
two men with me, one my mate, the other a pas- 
8enger> where we expected to perish, believing "^e 
place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to 
think of it" 

^ Where are those brutes, your enemies ?" said 
I ; " do you know where they are gone ?"— " There 
they are. Sir," said he, '' pointing to a thicket of 
trees; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen 
us, and heard you speak; if they have, they will 
certainly murder us all." 

'' Have they any fire-arms ?" said I : he answer- 
ed, '' They had only two pieces, and one which 
they left in the boat"—" Well then," said 1, 



182 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

** leave the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep ; it 
is an easy thing to kill than all ; but shall we ra- 
ther take them prisoners ?" He told nve there were 
two desperate villains among them, that it was 
scarce safe to shew apy mercy to ; but if they were 
secured, he believed all the rest would return to 
their duty : I asked him, which they were ? He 
told me, he could not at that distance describe 
them ; but he would obey my orders in any thing 
I would direct " Well," said I, " let us retreat 
out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and 
we will resolve farther;" so they willingly went 
back with me, till the woods covered us from them. 

" Look you. Sir," said I, " if I venture upon 
your deliverance, are you willing to make two con- 
ditions with me ?" He anticipated my proposals, 
by telKng me, that both he and the ship, if re- 
covered, should be wholly directed and command- 
ed by me in every thing ; and if the ship was not 
recovered, he would live and die with me in what 
part of the world soever I would send him ; and 
the two other men said the same. 

** Well," said I, " my conditions are but two: 1. 
That while you stay on this island with me, you 
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I 
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occa- 
sions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to 
me or mine, upon this island, and in the mean time 
' to be governed by orders. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 123 

'' 2. That if the ship is or may be recovered, 
you will carry me and ray maa to England^ pas- 
sage-free." 

He gave me all the assurance that the invention 
and faith of a man could devise, that he would 
comply with these most reasonable demands; and 
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge 
it upon all occasions as long as he lived. 

" Well then," said I, ** here are three muskets 
for you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what 
you think is proper to be done." He shewed ali 
the testimony of his gratitude that he was able ; 
but ofifered to be wholly guided by me : I told him, 
I thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the 
bedt method I could think of was, to fire upon them 
at once, as they lay ; and if any were not killed at 
the first volley, and ofifered to submit, we might 
save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi- 
dence to direct the shot. 

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill 
them, if he could help it ; but that those two were 
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of 
all the mutiny in the ship ; and if they escaped, 
we should be undone still ; for they would go on 
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and 
destroy us all. " Well then," said I, " necessity 
legitimates my advice; for it is the only way to 



1«4 THE LIFE AMD ADVENTURES 

save our lives." However, seeing him still can- i 

tious of shedding blood, I told him, they should go z^ 

themselves, and manage as they found convenient* i: 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of •{ 

them awake, and soon after we saw two of them 2I 

on their feet. I asked him, if either of them were i 

the men who he had said were the heads of the ^ 

mutiny ? He said. No. " Well then," said I, *' you 3 

may let them escape, and Providence seems to ] 

have wakened them on purpose to save them- 
selves." " Now," said I, " if the rest escape you, 
it is your fault" 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had 
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and 
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece 
in his hand : the two men, who were with him, go* 
ing first, made some noise, at which one of the sea- 
men, who was awake, turned about, and seeing them 
coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late 
then ; for the moment he cried out, they fired, I 
mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving 
his own piece : they had so well aimed their shot 
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed 
on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; 
but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and 
called eagerly' for help to the other; but the cap. 
tain stepping to hiuj, told him it was too late to 
cry for help; he should call upon God to forgive 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. J 25 

his villany; and with that word knocked him down 

with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke 

more : there were three more in the com{>any, and 

one of them was also slightly wounded. By this 

time I was come ; and when they saw their danger, 

and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for 

mercy. The captain told them he would spare 

their lives, if they would give him any assurance 

of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been 

guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in 

recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her 

back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They 

gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that 

could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, 

and spare their lives, which I was not against; only 

I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot 

while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the cap- 
tain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, 
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did ; 
and by and by, three straggling men, that were 
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back 
Hpon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing their cap* 
tain who before was their prisoner, now their con- 
queror, they submitted to be bound also ; and so 
our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should 
inquire into one another's circumstances : I began 



1?0 TH£ LIF£ AND ADVENTURES 

first, and told him my whole history, which he heard 
with an attention even to amazement, and particu- 
larly at the wonderful manner of my being famish- 
ed with provisions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as 
my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affect- 
ed him deeply ; but when he reflected from thence 
upon himself, and how I seemed to have been pre- 
served there on purpose to save his life, the tears 
ran down his face, and he conld not speak a word 
more. 

After this communication was at an end, I car- 
ried him and his two men into my apartments, 
leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the 
top of the house; where I refreshed them with 
such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the 
contrivances I had made during my long, long in- 
habiting that place. 

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was per- 
fectly amazing ; but, above all, the captain admi- 
red luy fortification ; and how perfectly I had con- 
cealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, 
having now been planted near twenty years, and 
the trees growing much faster than in England, was 
become a little wood, and so thick, that it was un- 
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where 
I had reserved my little winding passage into it : 
this I told him was my castle, and my residence ; 
bat that I had a seat in the country, as most pria- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I«7 

ces have, whether I could retreat upon occasion^ 
and I would shew him that too another time ; but 
at present our business was to consider how to re- 
cover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; 
but told me he was perfectly at a loss what mea- 
sure to take : for that there were still six^nd-twenty 
hands on board, who having entered into a cursed 
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives 
to the law« would be hardened in it now by despe- 
ration; and would carry it on, knowing that, if 
they were reduced, they should be brought to the 
gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any 
of the English colonies; and that therefore there 
would be no attacking them with so small a num- 
ber as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, 
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and 
that therefore something was to be resolved on 
very speedily, as well to draw the men on board 
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent 
their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon 
this, it presently occurred to me, that in a little 
while, the ship's crew wondering what was become 
of their comrades, and of the -boat, would certain- 
ly come on shore in their other boat to see for 
them; and that then perhaps they might come 
armed, and be too strong for us : this he allowed 
was rational. 



in THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Upon this I told him^ the first thing we had to 
do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beaclv 
so that they might not carry her oif; and taking 
every thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as 
not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on 
board, took the arms which were left on board oat 
of her, and whatever else we found there, which 
was a bottle of brandy and another of rum, a few 
biscuit cakes, an horn of powder, and a great lump 
of sugar in a piece of canvas ; the sugar was five 
or six pounds ; all which was very welcome to me, 
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had 
had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore, (the 
oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were car- 
riied before as above,) we knocked a great hole in 
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough 
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we 
could be capable to recover the ship ; but my view 
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did 
not much question to make her fit again to carry 
us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our 
friends the Spaniard* in my way,^ for I had them 
fttill in my thoughts.

The Ship makes Signals for her Boat-^^On receiving 
no GTuxver, she sends another Boat on Shore — ilfe- 
thods by which tf^e secure this Boat's Crew, and re*

While we were thus preparing oar designs, and 
had first by main strength heaved the boat up up- 
on the beach, so high that the tide would not float 
her off at high water mark ; and, besides, had 
broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly 
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should 
do; we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her 
make a waft with her ancient, as a signal for the 
boat to come on board ; but no boat stirred ; and 
they fired several times, making other signals for 
the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved 
firuitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we 
saw them (by the help of our glasses] hoist another 
boat out, and row towards the shore ; and we founds 

TOI.. II. I 



laO THE UFfi AKD ADVENTURES 

as they approached, that there were"^ no Ies3 than 
ten men in her, and that they had fire arms with 
them. 

As 'the ship lay almost two leagues from the 
shore, we had a full view of them as they came, 
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces ; 
because the tide having set them a little to the east 
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, -to 
come to the same place where the other had land^ 
,ed, and where the boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, 
and the captain knew the persons and characters 
of all the men in the boat ; of whom he said that 
there were three very honest fellows, who he was 
sure were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being 
overpowered and frighted : but that for tii^ boat- 
swain, who, it seenis^ was the chief officer among 
them, and ail the rest, they were as outrageous as 
any of the ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made 
desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly ap- 
prehensive he was, that they would be too power- 
ful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our 
circumstances were past the operations of fear! 
that seeing almost every condition that could be 
was better than that we were supposed to be in, 
we ought to expect that the consequence, whether 
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance : I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

9sked him, what he thought of the circumstances 
of my life, and whether a deliverance were not 
worth venturing for ? " And where. Sir," said I, 
" is your belief of my being preserved here on 
purpose to save your life, which elevated you a 
little while ago? For my part,*' said I, ''there 
seems to be one thing amiss in all the prospect of 
it"_** What's that, ?" says he. " Why," said I, 
" 'tis that as you say, there are three or four honest 
fellows among them, which should be spared ; had 
they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I 
should have thought God^s providence had singled 
them out to deliver them into your hands : for, de- 
pend upon it, every man of them that comes 
ashore, are our own, and shall die or live as they 
behave to us." 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheer- 
ful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged 
him ; so we set vigorously to our business. We 
had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming 
from the ship, considered of separating our pri- 
soners, and had indeed se(:ured them effectually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was less as-- 
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of 
the three (delivered men} to my cave, where they 
were remote enough, and out of danger of being 
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out 
of the woods, if they could have delivered them- 



139 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

selves : here they left them bounds but gave them 
provisions, aad promised them, if thfey contintied 
there quietly, to give them their liberty iu a day 
or two; but that if they attempted their escape, 
they should be put to death without mercy. They 
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with 
patience, and were very thankful that they had 
such good usage as to have provisions and a light 
left them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as 
we made ourselves) for their comfort ; and they did 
not know but that he stood sentinel over them at 
the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of 
them were kept pinioned indeed, because the cap- 
tain was not free to trust them ; but the other two 
were taken into my service upon their captain's 
recommendation, and upon their solemnly enga- 
ging to live and die with us ; so, with them and the 
three honest men, we were seven men well armed ; 
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal' 
well enough with the ten that were a-coming, con- 
sidering that the captain had said, there wei-e three 
or four honest men among them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their 
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, 
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after 
them, which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid 
th^y would rather hs^ve left the boat at aa anchor. 



OtP ROBINSON CRUSOB. 1S3 

some distance from the shore, with some hands in 
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to 
seize the boat. 

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran 
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they 
were under a great surprise to find her stripped as 
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in 
her bottom. 

After they had mused a while upon this, they set 
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all 
their might, to try if they could make their com- 
panions hear; but all was to no purpose : then they. 
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their 
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes 
made the woods ring; but it was all one : those in 
the cave, we were sure, could not hear ; and those 
in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, 
yet durst give no answer to them. 

They were so astonished at the surprise of this, 
that,. as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go 
all on board again to their ship, and let them know 
there, that the men were all murdered, and the 
long boat staved; accordingly, they immediately 
launched the boat again, and got all of them on 
board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board 
the ship again and set sail, givinu; their comrades 



134 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

up for lost, and so he should siill lose the ship which 
he was in hopes we should have recovered ; but he 
was quickly as much frighted the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, 
but we perceived them all coming on shore again ; 
but with this new measure in tlieir conduct, which 
it seems they consulted together upon; viz. to 
leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on 
shore, and go up into the country to look for their 
fellows. \ 

This was a great disappointment to us; for now 
we were at a loss what to do ; for our seizing those 
seven men on shore would b^ no advantage to us 
if we let the boat escape, because they would then 
row away to the ship ; and then the rest of them 
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our re- 
covering the ship would be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see 
what the issue of things might present The seven 
men came on shore, and the three who remained 
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the 
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them ; so 
that it was impossible for us to come at them in 
the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, 
marching towards the top of the little hill, under 
which my habitation lay ; and we could see them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us : we 

15 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

could have been very glad they would have come 
nearer to us, so that we might htaive fired at them ; 
or that they would have gone farther o^ that we 
might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the 
hill, where they could see a great way in the valley 
and woods, which lay towards the north-east part, 
and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and 
hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it 
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from 
one another, they sat down together under a tree, 
to consider of it : had they thought fit to have 
gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had 
done, they had done the job for us; but they were 
too full of apprehensions of danger, to venture to 
go to sleep, though they could not tell what the 
danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me 
upon this consultation of theirs ; viz. that perhaps 
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to 
make their fellows hear, and that we should all 
sally upon ihem, just at the juncture when their 
pieces were all discharged, and they would cer- 
tainly yield, and we should have them without 
bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided it was 
done while we were near enough to come up to 
them, before they could load their pieces again. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still 



136 THE LIFE AND ADtENTtfRES 

a long time very irresolute what course to take ; at 
length I told them^ there would be nothing to b« 
done in my opinion till night ; and then, if they 
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find 
a way to get between them and the shore, and so 
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, 
to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing, and were very uneasy ; when, 
after long consultations, we saw them start all up, 
and march down toward the sea : it seems, they 
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on 
board the ship again, give their companions over 
for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage 
with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the 
shore, I imagined it to be as it really was; that 
they had given over their search, and were for 
going back again ; and the captain, as soon as I 
told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the ap- 
prehensions of it ; but I presently thought of a stra- 
tagem to fetch them back again, and which an- 
swered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go* 
over the little creek westward, towards the place 
where the savages came on shore when Friday was 
rescued ; and as soon as they came to a little rising 



OF ItOBINSON CRUSOfi. 1S7 

ground^ at about half a mile's distance, I bade them 
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found 
the seamen heard them ; that as soon as ever they 
heard the seamen answer them, they should return 
it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a 
round, always answering when the others hallooed, 
to draw them as far into the island^ and among the 
woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to 
me, by such ways as I directed. 

They were just going into the boat, when Fri- 
day and the mate hallooed> and they presently 
heard them, and answering, run along the shore 
westward, towards the voice they heard, when they 
were presently stopped by the creek, where the 
water being up, they could not get over, and call- 
ed for the boat to come up, and set them over, as 
indeed I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed 
that the boat being gone up a good way into the 
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the land, 
they took one of the three men out of her to go 
along with them, and left only two in the boat, ha- 
ying fastened her to the stump of a little tree on 
the shore. 

This was what I wished for, and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their bu- 
siness, I took the rest with me, and, • crossing the 
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men 



138 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

before they were aware, one of them lying on 
8hore> and the other being in the boat; the fellow 
on shore was between sleeping and waking* aiid 
going to start up, the captain, who was foremost, 
ran in upon him and knocked him down, and then 
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a 
dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield, when, he saw five men upon 
him, and his comrade knocked down ; besides, this 
was, it seems, one of the three who were not so 
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and 
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, 
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's 
mate so well managed their business with the rest, 
that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, 
from one hill to another, and from one wood to an- 
other, till they not only heartily tired them, but 
left them where they were very sure they could 
not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and 
indeed they were heartily tired themselves also by 
the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in tfie dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make 
sure work with them. 

It was sevieral hours after Friday came back to 
me before they came back to their boat; and we 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 130 

coold hear the fonemost of them, long before they 
came, quite up, calling to those behind to come 
along ; and jOouM also hear them answer, and com- 
plain how lame and tired they were, and not being 
able to come any faster, which was very welcome 
news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat ; but it is 
impossible to express their confusion, when they 
found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide 
ebbed out, and their two men gone: we could hear 
them call to one another, in a most lamentable 
manner, telling one another they were gotten into 
|kn enchanted island ; that either there were inha- 
bitants in it, and they should all be murdered ; or 
else there were devils or spirits in it, and they 
should be all carried awa}'- and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two com- 
rades by their names a great many times, but no 
answer: after some time, we could see them, by 
the little light there was, run about wringing tlieir 
bands, like men in despair; and that sometimes 
they would go and sit down in the bctat to rest 
themselves, then come ashore, and walk about 
again, and so the same thing over again. 

My men would fain have had me given them 
leave to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but 
I was willing to take them at some advantage, so 
to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could f 



140 THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and especially I was unwilling to hazard the kill** 
ing any of our men, knowing the other men were 
yery well armed : I resolved to wait to see if they 
did not separate ; and therefore^ to make sure of 
them, I drew my ambuscade nearer ; and ordered 
Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands 
and feet as close to the ground as they could, that 
they might not be discovered, and get as near them 
as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, till the 
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the 
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de- 
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking 
towards them with two more of the crew ; the cap- 
tain was so eager, at having the principal rogue so 
much in his power, that he could hardly have pa- 
tience to let him come so near as to be sure of him; 
for they only heard his tongue before*: but when 
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting 
up on their feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next 
tnan was shot in the body, and fell just by him, 
though he did not die till an hour or two after; aud 
the third run for it 

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced 
with my whole array, which was now eight men; 
viz. myself generalissimo ; Friday my lieutenant* 
general; the captain and his two men, and the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

three prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with 
arms. 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that 
they could not see our number ; and I made the 
man they had left in the boat, who was now one of 
US, to call them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce 
them to terms ; which fell out just as we desired : 
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition 
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; 
so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 
" Tom Smith, Tom Smith/' Tom Smith answered 
immediately, "Who's that? Robinsoa?" For it 
seems he knew his voice. The other answered, 
*' Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down 
your arms, and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment. 

" Who must we yield to ? where are they ?** 
says Smith again. " Here they are," says he ; 
'' here is our captain and fifly men with him, have 
been hunting you this two hours ; the boatswain is 
killed. Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; 
and if you do not yield, you are all lost." 

** Will they give us quarter, then ?" says Tom 
Smith, 'f and we will yield." '* I'll go and ask, if 
you promise to yield," says Robinson. So he 
asked the captain, and the captain himself then 
palls out, *' You, Smith, you know my voice, if you 



14S THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

lay down your arms immediately, and sabmit, you 
£hali have your lives^ all but Will Alkins/' 

Upon this Will Atkios cried out, '' For God's 
sake, captain, give me quarter: what have I done ? 
they have all been as bad as I ;'' (which by the 
way was not true, either; for it seen^s this Will 
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the cap- 
tain when they first mutinied, and. used him bar^ 
barously, in tying his hands, and giving him inju* 
rious language) : however, the ca[)tain told him he 
must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to 
the governor's mercy, by which he meant me ; for 
they ail called me governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and 
begged their lives ; and I sent the man that had 
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound 
them all ; and then my great army of fifty meng 
which, particularly with those three, were in all but 
eight, came up and seized upon them all, and upon 
their boat, only that I kept myself and one more 
out of sight, for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to 
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, 
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expos* 
tulated with them upon the villany of their prac- 
tices with him, and at length, upon the farther 
wickedness of their design ; and how certainly it 



OF RQBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

most bring them to misery and distress in the end, 
and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared Tery penitent, and begged 
hard for their lives : as for that, he told them they 
were none of his prisoners, but the commander's of 
the island ; that they thought they had set him on 
shore in a barren uninhabited island : but it had 
pleased God so to direct them, that the island was 
inhabited, and that the governor was an English- 
man ; that he might hang them all there, if he 
pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he 
supposed he would send them to England, to be 
dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, 
whom he was commanded by the governor to advise 
to prepare for death ; for that he would be hanged 
in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it 
had its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees 
to beg the captain to intercede with the governor 
for his life ; and all the rest begged of him for 
God's sake, that they might not be sent to Eng- 
land. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our de- 
liverance was come, and that it would be a most 
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in 
getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the 
dark from them, that they might not see what kind 
of a governor they had, and called the captain ta 



144 THE LIF£ AND ADVENTURES 

me : when I called, as at a good distance^ one of 
the men was ordered to speak again, and say to 
the captain, ^ Captain, the commander calls for 
you ;" and presently the captain replied, " Tell his 
excellency I am just a-coming/* This more per- 
fectly amused them ; and they all believed that the 
commander was just by with^his fi&y men. 

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which he liked won- 
derfully well, and resolved to put it in execution 
the next morning. 

But, in order to execute it with more art, and to 
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the 
prisoners, and that he should go and takq. Atkins, 
and two more of the worst of them, and send them 
pinioned to the cave where the others lay : this was 
committed to Friday, and the two men who came 
on shore with the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; 
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men 
in their condition. 

The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, 
of which I have given a full description ; and as it 
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was 
secure enough, considering they were upon their 
behaviour. ^Z 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who 
was to enter into a parley with them ; in a word^ 



6F ROBINSOK CRU80JS. 145 

lb try them^ and tell me, whether he thought they 
Blight be trusted or no, to go on boards and sur* . 
prise the ship. He talked to them of the injury 
done him, of the condition they were brought to ; 
and that though the governor had given them quar- 
ter for their lives, as to the present action, yet that 
if they were sent to England, they would all be 
hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they 
would join in such an attempt as to recover the 
ship, he would have the governor's engagement for 
their pardon. 

Any oue may guess how readily such a propo« 
sal would be accepted by men in their condition: 
they fell down on their knees to the captain, and 
promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they 
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that 
they should owe their lives to him, and would go 
with him all over the world ; that they would own 
him for a father to them as long as they lived. 

'' Well/' says the captain, " I must go and tell 
the governor what you say, and see what I can do 
to bring him to consent to it'' So he brought me 
an account of the temper he found them in ; and 
that he verily believed they would be ftiithfol. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told 
him he should go back again, and choose out five 
of them, and tell them, that they should see that they 
did not want men ; but he would take out those fir* 

VOL. II. K 



146 THE LIFE AND ADTENTURES 

to be his assistants^ and tbat the goyernor would 
keep the other two, and the three that were sent 
prisoners to the castle, (my cavej as hostages for 
the fidelity of those five ; and that, if they proved 
tinfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should 
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore. 
. This looked severe, and convinced them that 
the governor was in earnest; however, they had 
no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now 
the business of the prisoners, aa much as of the 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 
Our strength was now thus ordered for the ex- 
pedition : 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to 
wl|om, having their characters from the captain, 
I had given their liberty, and trusted them with 
arms. 3. The other two whom I kept till now in 
my bower pinioned; but, upon the captain's motion, 
had now released. 4. These five released at last; 
< so that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept 
prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was wiHing to venture 
with these hands- on board the ship : for, as for me, 
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper 
for us to stir, having seven men lefi: behind ; and 
it was employment enough for us to keep them 
asunder, and supply them with victuals. 

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep 

31 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

them fast ; but Friday went twice a day to them> 
to supply them with necessaries ; and I made the 
other two carry provisions to a certain distance, 
where Friday was to take it. 

When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it 
was with the captain, who told them, I was the 
person the governor had ordered to look after 
them, and that it was the governor's pleasure that 
they should not stir any where but by my direc- 
tion ; that if they did, they should be fetched into 
the castle, and be laid in irons ; so that as we never 
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now ap- 
peared as another person, and spoke of the gover- 
nor, the garrison, the castle, and the lil^e, upon all 
occasions. 

The cs^tain now had no difficulty before htm, 
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, 
and man them : he made his passenger captain of 
one, with four other men ; and himself, and his 
mate, and five more, went in the other : and they 
contrived their business very well ; for they came 
up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they 
came within call of the ship, he made Robinsoa 
hail them, and tell them he had brought off the 
men and the boat, but that it was a long time be- 
fore they had found them, and the like ; holding 
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side; 
when the captain and the mate, entering first with 



148 THE LIFE AND ADTENTURES 

their anns, immediately knoc&ed down the second 
mate and carpenter with the bat end of their mus- 
kets ; being very faithfully seconded by their men, 
they secured all the rest that were upon the main 
and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches 
to keep them down who were below; when the 
other boat, and their men, entering at the fore- 
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the 
skuttle which went down into the cook-roora> 
making three men they found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon the deck, 
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to 
break into the round-house, where the new rebel 
captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, was got- 
ten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten 
fire-arms in their hands ; and when the mate with 
a crow split open the door, the new captain and 
his men fired boldly among thetn, and wounded the 
mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and 
wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, in- 
to the round-house,- wounded as he was, and with 
his pistol shot the new captain through the head, 
the bullets entering at his mouth, and . came out 
again behind one of his ears; so that he never 
spoke a word ; upon which the rest yielded, and 
the ship was taken efiectually without any more 
lives^ being lost. 



OF ROBIN^SON CRUSOE. 149 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the cap- 
lain ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the 
signal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of 
his success ; which you may be sure I was very 
glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore 
for it till near two of the clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid' me 
down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue to 
me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur- 
prised with the noise of a gun ; and presently start- 
ing up, I heard a man call me by the name of go- 
vernor, governor ! and presently I knew the cap- 
tain's voice ; when climbing up to the top of the 
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he 
embraced me in his arms : " My dear friend and 
deliverer,'* says he, " there's your ship, for she is 
all yours, and so are we^ and all that belong to 
her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she 
rode within a little more than half a mile of the 
shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as 
they were masters of her; and the weather being 
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the 
mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, the 
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place 
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at 
jny door. 

• I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur- 
prise ; for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly 



IbO THE LIFE AKD ADYENTUllES 

put into my hands, all thiags easy, and a large 
ship juflt ready to carry me away whither I pleased 
to go* At first, for some time, I was not able to an* 
swer one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, 
I held fast by him, or I should haye fallen to the 
ground. 

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pall- 
ed a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram 
of cordial, which be had brought on purpose for 
me : after I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, 
and though it. brought me to myself, yet it was a 
good while before I could speak a word to him. 

AU this while the poor man was in as great an 
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was; 
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me> 
to compose and bring me to myself: but such was 
the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my 
spirits into confusion ; at last it broke into tears, 
and in a little while after I recovered my speech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my 
deliverer ; and we rejoiced together : I told him, I 
looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to de« 
liver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to 
be a chain of wonders ; that such things as these 
were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of 
Providence governing the world, and an evidence, 
that the eyes of an infinite Power could search into 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 161 

the remotest corner of the worlds ^LVtd gend lielp to 
the miserable whenever he pleased. 

1 forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness 
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless 
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner pro- 
vided for one in euch a wilderness, and in such a 
desolate condition, but from whom every deliver- 
ance must always be acknowledged to proceed ? 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me, 
he had brought me some little refreshments, such 
as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches who 
had been so long his masters had not plundered 
him of. Upon this he called aloud to the boat, 
and bids his men bring the things ashore that were 
for the governor ; and indeed it was a present, as 
if I had been one, not that I was to be carried 
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell 
upon the island still, and they were to go without 
me. 

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full 
of excellent cordial waters ; six large bottles of 
Madeira wine, the bottles held two quarts apiece ; 
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good 
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, 
with a bag of pease, and about a hundred weight of 
biscuit 

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of 
flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime- 



158 THE LIFE AXD ADVENTURES 

juice, and abundance of other things : but besides 
these, and what was a thousand times more usefbl 
to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very 
good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of 
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very 
good suit of clothes of his own, which had been 
worn but very little. In a word, he clothed me 
from head to foot 

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any 
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but 
never was any thing in the world of that kind so 
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me 
to wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his 
good things were brought into my little apartment, 
we began to consult what was to be. done with the 
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering 
whether we might venture to take them away with 
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew 
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree ; 
and the captain said, he knew they were such 
rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and if he 
did carry them away, it must be in irons, as male- 
factors, to be delivered over to justice at the first 
English cok>ny he could come at; and I found that 
the captain himself was very anxious about it. 

Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I 
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. !» 

to make it their own request that he should leave 
them upon the island : " I should be very glad of 
that,'' says the captain, " with all my heart" 

*' Well/' said I, " I will send for them, and talk 
.with them for you :" so I caused Friday and the 
two hostages, for they were now discharged, their 
comrades having performed their promise ; I say, 
1 caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the 
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and 
keep them there till I came. 

After some time, I came thither dre^d in my 
new habit, and now I was called governor again. 
Being all met, and the captain with me, I causefi 
the men to be brought before me, and I told them, 
I had had a full account of their villanous behaviour 
to the captain, and how they had run away with 
the ship, and were preparing to commit farther rol>- 
1>eries ; but that Providence had ensnared thenii in 
their own ways, and that they were fallen into the 
pit which they had digged for others. 

I let them know, that by my direction the ship 
had been sei^d, that she lay now in the road, and 
they might see by and by, that their new captain 
had received the reward of his villany; for that 
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm : that 
as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say, 
why I should not execute them as pirates taken i|i 
the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt 
J had authority to do. , 



154 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, 
that they had nothing to say but this, that when 
they were taken, the captain promised them their 
Kvesy and they humbly implored my mercy : but I 
told them I knew not what mercy to shew them ; 
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island 
with all my men, and had taken passage with the 
captain to go for England : and as for the captain, 
he could not can*}' them to England, other than as 
prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and run- 
ning away with the ship; the consequence of which 
they must needs know, would be the gallows ; so 
that I could not tell which was best for them, un^ 
less they had a mind to take their fate in the 
island ; if they desired that, I did not care, as I had 
liberty to leave it : I had some inclination to give 
them their lives, if they thought they could shift 
on shore. They seemed very thankful for it ; said 
they would much rather venture to stay there, than 
to be carried to England to be hanged ; so I left it 
on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some dif. 
ficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there ; 
upon this I seemed to be a little angry with the 
captain, and told him, that they were my prisoners^ 
not his; and that seeing I had c^ered them so 
much favour, I would be as good as my word ; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

tbat if he did not think fit to consent to it, I woald*. 
set them at liberly as I found them ; and if he did 
not like that, he might take them again if he could 
catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I 
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them re- 
tire into the woods, to the place whence they came, 
and I would leave them some fire-arms, some am- 
munition j and some directions how they should live 
very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship ; 
but told the captain, that I would stay that night 
to prepare my things; and desired him to go on 
board in the mean time, and keep all right in the 
ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for 
me : ordering him in the mean time to cause the 
new captain who was killed, to be hanged at the 
yard-arm, that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men 
up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously 
* into discourse with them of their circumstances : I 
told them, I thought they had made a right choice ; 
that if the captain carried them away, they would 
certainly be hanged : I shewed them their captain 
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them 
they had nothing less to expect 

When they had all declared their willingness to 
stay, I then told them, I would let them into tho 



.156 THE L1F£ AND ADVENTURES 

story of my living there, and put them into the 
way of making it easy to them : accordingly I gave 
them the whole history of the place, and of my 
coming to it ; shewed them my fortifications, tb^e 
way I made my bread, planted my com, cured my 
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to 
make them easy. I told them the story of the 
sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for 
whom I left a leiter, and made them promise to 
treat them in common with themselves. 

I left them my fire-anns ; viz. five inuskets, 
three fowling-pieces, and three swords : I had 
about a barrel of powder left; for after the first 
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. ' I 
gave them a description of the way I managed the 
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to 
make both butter and cheese. 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own 
stor}^ ; and I told them, I would prev,ail with the 
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder 
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I 
would have been very glad of; also I gave them 
the bag of pease which the captain had brought vd^ 
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase 
them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day 
and went on board the ship ; we prepared imme- 
diately to sail, but did not weigh that ni^ht ; the 



OF ROB INSON CRUSOE* 1 51* 

next morning early, two of the fire men came 
swimming to the ship's side^ and making a most 
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to 
be taken into the ship for God*s sake, for they 
should be murdered ; and begged the captain to 
take them on board though he hanged them im- 
mediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no 
power without me ; but after some difficulty, and 
after their solemn promises of amendment, they 
were taken on board, and were some time after 
soundly whipped and pickled ; after which they 
proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, I went with the boat on 
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised 
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces- 
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added, 
which they took, and were very thankful for: I 
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it 
lay in my way to send a vessel to take them in, I 
would not forget them.

^When I took leave of this island, I carried on

I forgot not to take the money I formerly mention-

was grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly 
pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and 
handled ; and also the money I found in the wreck 
of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De« 
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the 
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-

twenty years^ two months, and nineteen days : 
being delivered from the second captivity the same 
day of the month that I first made my escape in 
the barco-longo, from among the moors of Salee. 

In this vessel^ after a long voyage, I arrived in 
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, 
having been thirty and five years absent. 

When I came to England, I was a perfect 
stranger to all the world, as if I had never been 
known there : my benefactor, and faithful steward, 
whom I had left in trust with my money, was alive, 
but had had great misfortunes in the world, was 
become a widow the second time, and very low in 
the world : I made her easy as to what she owed 
me, assuring her, I would give her no trouble ; 
but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her former 
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my 
little stock would afford, which at that time would 
indeed allow me to do but little for her: but I 
assured her, I would never forget her former kind- 
ness to me ; nor did I forget her, when I had suffi- 
cient to help her ; as shall be observed in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my 
lather was dead, and my mother, and all the family 
extinct ; .except that I found two sisters, and two^-. 
of the children of one of my brotherst and as | '• 
had been long ago given over for dead, there had 
been uo provision made for me; so that, in a wordy 



<1lf 



IflD THE LIFte AND ADVENTURES 

I found nothing to relieve or assist tne ; and that 
little money I had> would not do much for me 
as to settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which 
I did not expect ; and this was, that the master of 
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by 
the same means saved the ship and cargo, having 
given a very handsome account to the owners, of 
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men> 
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and 
some other merchants concerned, and all together 
made me a very handsome compliment upon that 
subject, and a present of almost two hundred 
pounds sterling. ' 

But after making several reflections upon the 
circumstances of my life, and how little way this 
would go towards settling me in the world, I re- 
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come 
by some information of the state of my plantation 
in the Brazils, and what was become of my partner, 
who, I had reason to suppose, had some years now 
given me over for dead. 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where 
I arrived in April following ; my man Friday ac- 
^ohipanyiflg me very honestly in all these ram- 
Wlngs, add proving a most faithful servant upon all 
i>ccasions. 

When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 161 

aftd to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the 
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, 
off the shore of Africa: he was now grown old, 
and had left off the sea, having put his son, who 
was far from a yoong man, into his ship; and who 
still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not 
know me, and, indeed, I hanily knew him ; hut I 
soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I 
told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of our old a&- 
quaintance, I inquired^ you may be sure, after my 
plantation and my partner : the old man told me, 
he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; 
but that he could assure me, that when he came 
away, my partner was living ; but the trustees, 
whom I had joined with him, to take cognizance of 
my part, were both dead ; that^ however, he be« 
lieved that I would have a V^ery good account of 
the improvement of the plantation ; for that, upon 
the general belief of my oeing cast away and 
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of 
the produce of my part of the plantation, to the 
procurator fiscal ; who had appropriated it, in case 
I never came to claim it, one third to the king, and 
two thirds to the monastery of St Augustine, to be 
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the 
conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but 
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the 

VOL. II. I. 



IflS THB LIFB AND ADVBNTURES 

Inheritance, it would be restored ; only that the im- 
provement, or annual production, being distributed 
to charitable uses, could not be restored ; but be as- 
sured me, that the steward of the king's revenue 
(from lands,) and the provedore, or steward of the 
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the 
incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every 
year a faithful account of the produce, of which 
they received duly my moiety. 

I asked him, if he knew to what height of im- 
provement he had brought the plantation; and 
whether he thought it might be worth looking af- 
ter; or whether, on my going thither, I should 
meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just 
right in the moiety. 

He told me, he could not tell exactly to what de* 
gree the plantation was improved; but this he knew, 
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon 
the enjoying but one half of it; and that, to the 
best of his remembrance, he had heard, that the 
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, grant- 
ed away to some other monastery, or religious 
house, amounted to above two hundrc^d moidores a 
year; that, as to my being restored to a quiet pos- 
session of it;, there was no question to be made of 
that, my partner being alive to witness my title, 
and my name being also enrolled in the register of 
the country. Also he told me» that th^ survivors 

13 



OF KOBINJSON CRUSOE. l^ 

of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, 
and very wealthy, and he believed I would not only 
have their assistance for putting me in possession, 
but would find a very considerable sum of money 
in their hands for my accoimt, being the produce 
of the farm, while their fathers held the trust, and 
before it was given up, as above, which, as he re- 
membered, was about twelve years. 

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at 
this account, and inquired of the old captain, how 
it came to pass, that the trustees should thus dis- 
pose of my effects, when he knew that I had made 
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese cap- 
lain, my universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true ; but that, as there was 
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as 
executor, until some certain account should come 
of my death; and that, besides, he was not willing 
to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that it was 
true, he had registered my will, and put in his 
claim; and could he have given any account of my 
being dead or alive, he would have acted by pro- 
curation, and taken possession of the ingenio, (so 
they called the sugar-house,) and had given his son, 
who was now at the Brazils, order to do it 

" But,** says the old man, " I have one piece of 
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ao- 
ceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that believ«> 



IM THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ing yoa were lost* and all the world belieying mf 
also, your partner and tnistees did ofler to account 
to me in your name, for six or eight of the first 
years of profit, which I received; but there being 
at that tinae,'' says he, " great disbursements for in- 
creasing the works^ building an ii^nioy and baying 
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as after- 
wards it produced : however/' says the old man, ** I 
shall give you a true account of what I have re- 
ceived in all, and how 1 have disposed of it.'' 

After a few days farther conference with this 
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the six 
first years income of my plaatation, signed by my 
partner, and the merchants trustees, being always 
delivered in goods \ viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar 
in chests, besides rum, molasses^ &c. which is the 
consequence of a sugar-work ; and I found by this 
account, that every year the income considerably- 
increased : but, as above, the disbursement being 
large, the sum at first was small : however, the old 
man let me see, that he was debtor to me four 
hundred and seventy moidores of gold» besides sixty 
chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, 
which were lost in his ship, he having been ship- 
wrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years 
after my leaving the place. 

The good man then began to complain of his 
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 1«ft 

«8e of my money to recover his losses^ and bay him 
a share in a new ship ; *' however, my old friend/' 
flays he, ** you shall not want a supply in your ne- 
cessity ; and as soon as my son returns, you shall 
be fully satisfied/' 

Upon this he polls out an old pouch, and gives 
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and 
giving me the writings of his title to the ship which 
his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was 
a quarter part owner, and his son another, he puts 
them both in my hands for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and 
kindness of the poor man, to be able to bear this; 
and remembering what he had done for me, how he 
had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had 
used me on all occasions, and particularly how sin- 
cere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly re- 
frain weeping at what he said to me ; therefore first 
I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to 
spare so much money at that time, and if it would 
4iot straiten him ? He told me he could not say but 
it might straiten him a little ; but, however, it was 
my money, and I might want it more than he. 

£very thing the good man said was full of aflfee- 
tion, and I could hardly refrain fix>m tears while he 
spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the moi- 
dores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a 
receipt for them; then I returne-1 him the rest, gnd 



166 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

told hiin» if ever I had possession of the plantation, 
I woald return the other to him also, as indeed I 
afterwards did ; and that» as to the bill of sale of 
his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by 
any means ; but that if I wanted the money, I found 
he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did 
not, but came to receive what he gave me reason 
to expect, I wottld never have a penny more from 
him. 

When this was past, the old man began to ask 
me if he should put me in a method to make my 
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to 
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I 
pleased ; but that if I did not, there were ways 
enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap- 
propriate the profits to my use ; and as there were 
ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go away 
to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public 
register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath -that 
I was alive, and that I was the same person who 
took up the land for the planting the said planta- 
tion at first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a 
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with 
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac- 
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my 
staying with him till an account came of the re^ 
turn. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

Never any thing was mere honourable than the 
proceedings upon thU procuration; for in less than 
seyen months I reoeiTed a large packet from the 
survivors of my trustees^ the merchants^ on whose 
account I went to sea, in which were the following 
particular letters and papers inclosed. 

First, There was the account current of the pro« 
dttce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when 
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal 
captain, being for six years ; the balance appeared 
to be 1174 moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years 
more while tUey kept the effects in their hands, be- 
fore the government claimed the administration^ 
as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which they call civil death; and the balance of 
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amount- 
ed to crusadoes, which made 3241 moidores. 

Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines ac- 
count, who had received the profits for above four- 
teen years ; but not being able to account for what 
was disposed to the hospital, very honestly decla- 
red he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he 
acknowledged to my account As to the king's 
part, that refunded nothing. 

There was also a letter of my partner's, congra- 
tulating me very affectionately upon my being 
^live; giving me an account bow the estate w«^ 



108 THE L1F£ AND ADYBNTITRES 

improved, and what it prodaoed a year, with a par- 
ticular of the number of squares, or acres> that it 
contained; how planted, how many slaves there 
were upon it ; and, making two-and-twenty crosses 
for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave 
Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was 
alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over 
and take possession of my own, and in the mean 
time to give him orders to whom he should deliver 
my efi^ts, if I did not come myself; concluding 
with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of 
his family ; and sent me as a present, seven fine 
leopard skins, which he had, it seems, received from 
Africa by some other ship which he had sent 
thither; and who, it seems, had made a better 
voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of ex- 
cellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold 
uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. 

By the same fleet my merchant- trustees shipped 
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and 
the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end 
of Job was better than the beginning. It is im- 
possible to express the flutterings of my very heart, 
when I looked over these letters, and especially 
when I found all my wealth about me ; for as the 
Brazil ships came aU in fleets, the same ships which 
brought my letters bi'ought my goods ; and the ef« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1(K) 

fects were safe in the Tagus before the letter came 
to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew 
flick; and had not the old man run and fetched me 
a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had 
overset' nature, and I had died upon the spot. 

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so 
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and 
something of the real cause of my illness being 
known, he ordered roe to be let blood, after which 
I had relief, and grew well ; but I verily believe, if 
it had not been eased by the vent given in that 
manner to the spirits, I should have died. 

I was now master all on a sudden, of above fifty 
thousand pounds Sterling in money, and had an 
estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of 
above a thousand pounds a-year, as sure as an estate 
of lands in England ; and, in a word, I was in a con- 
dition which I scarce knew how to dnderstand, or 
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of. 

The first thing I did was to recompense my ori-p 
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had 
been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to 
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end. 
I shewed him all that was sent me ; I told him, 
that, next to the providence of Heaven, which dis-> 
poses all things, it was owing to him ; and that it 
now lay on me to reward him, which I would do 
ft bundred'fold. So I first returned to hioa the bmi« 



170 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

dred moidores I had received of him; theu I sent 
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general 
release or discharge for the four hundred and se- 
yenty moidores^ which he had acknowledged he 
owed rae, in the fullest and firmest manner possible; 
after which I caused a procuration to be drawn, em- 
powering him to be my receiver of the annual pro- 
fits of my plantation, and appointing my partner 
to account to him, and make the returns by the 
usual fleets to him in my name ; and ^ clause in th« 
end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a-year 
to him during his life, out of the efiects; and fifty 
moidores a-year to his son after him, for his life. 
And thus I requited my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my 
course next, and what to do with the estate tha^ 
Providence had thus put into my hands ; and, in- 
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I 
had in ray silent state of life in the island, where I 
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted ; whereas I had now a great 
charge upon me, and my business was how to se* 
cure it : I had never a cave to hide my money in> 
or a place where it might lie without lock or key» 
till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body 
would meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew 
9Pt where to put it„ or whom to trust with it ; mj 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 171 

old patcoDf the captain, indeed, was honest and 
that was the only refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils 
fieemed to summon me thither ; hat now I could 
not tell how to think of going thither .till I had set-- 
tied my affairs, and left my effects in some safe 
hands behind me. At first I thought of my old 
friend the widow, who, I knew, was honest, and 
would be just to me ; but then she was in years, 
and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in 
debt ; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go 
back to England myself, and take my effects with 
me. 

I was some months, however, before I resolved 
upon this ; and therefore as I had rewarded the old 
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my 
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor 
widow, whose husband had been my first benefac- 
tor, and she, while it was in her power, my faith* 
ful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, 
I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his corre- 
spondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to 
go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred 
pounds from me, and to talk with her, aud comfort 
her in her poverty, by telling h^r she should, if I 
lived, have a ferther supply. At the same time, I 
sent my two sisters in the country, each of theu> 
ja hundred pounds, they bein^, though not in wai>j^ 



m THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

yet not in very good circumstances ; one having 
been married, and left a widow ; and the other ha* 
viag a hasband not so kind to her as he shoald be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I 
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com- 
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to 
the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me ; and 
this greatly perplexed me. 

1 had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, 
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, 
naturalized to the place; but I had some little 
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensi- 
bly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre* 
sently. However, it was not religion that kept me 
from going thither for the present ; and as I had 
made no scruple of being openly of the religion of 
the country, all the while I was among them, so 
neither did I yet; only that now and then having 
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I 
began to think of living and dying among them, I 
began to regret my having professed myself a Pki* 
pist, and thought it might not be the best religion 
to die in. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Brazils, bul that 
really i did not know with whom to leave my ef- 
fects behind me ; so I resolved at last to go to £ng- 
}iiDd with them, where if I arrived, I concluded I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179 

^ould makci some acquaintance, or find some rela*" 
latioDS, that would be faithful to ^le ; and accord-^ 
ingly I prepared to go for England with all my 
wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I 
first (the Brazil fleet being just going away) resoU 
yed to give answers suitable to the just and faith- 
ful account of things I had from thence ; and first 
to the prior of St Augustine I wrote a letter full of 
thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the 
eight hundred and seventy- two moidores, whicK 
was undisposed of, which I desired might be given^ 
five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred 
and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should di- 
rect, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me, and 
the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, 
with all the acknowledgment that so much justice 
and honesty called for ; as for sending them any 
present^ they were far above having any occasion 
of it. 

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging 
his industry in the improving the plantation, and 
his integrity iu increasing the stock of the work^ ; 
giving him instructions for his future government 
of my pact according to the powers I had lefl with 
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send 
whatever became due to me, till he should hear 



174 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

from me more particularly ; assuring him, that it 
was my intention,- not only to come to him, but to 
settle myself there for the remainder of my life. 
To this I added a very handsome present of some 
Italian silks for bis wife and two daughters, for 
.such the captain's son informed me he had; with 
two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I 
could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black bays, and 
some Flanders lace of a good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, 
and turned all ray effects into good bills of ex- 
change, my next difficulty was^ which way to go 
to England. I had been accustomed enough to the 
sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to 
England by sea at that tiine ; and though I could 
give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased 
upon me so much, that though I had once shipped 
my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, 
and that not once, but two or three times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, 
and this might be one of the reasons. But let no 
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts 
in cases of such moment. Two of the ships which 
I had singled out to go in, I mean more particu- 
larly singled out than any other, that is to say, 
so as in one of them to put my things on board, 
«nd in the other to have agreed. with the captain; 
I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one wtis 



Of" ROBINSON CRUSO£« Uft 

taken by the Algerines, and the other was c&st 
away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people 
drowned except three ; so that, in either of those 
vessels, I had been made miserable^ and in which 
most, it was hard to say. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my 
old pilots to whom I communicated every tbing, 
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea ; but either 
to go by laud to the Groyne, and cross over the 
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it w^as but 
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so 
to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and 
so all the way by land through France. 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going 
by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I 
resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I 
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was 
by much the pleasanter way ; and to make it more 
so, my old captain brought an English gentleman^ 
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing 
to travel with me ; after which, we picked up two 
who were English, and merchants also, and two 
young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Pa- 
ris only : so that we were in all six of us, and five 
servants, the two merchants and the two Portuguese 
contenting themselves with one servant between 
two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I got an 
English sailor to travel with me as a servant, be<*

sides my man Frid^y« who was too much a strailA 
ger to be capable of supplying the place of a ser-^ 
Tant upon the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon : and oor 
company being all very well mounted and armed, 
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the 
honour to call me captain, as well because I was 
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and 
indeed was the original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea 
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my 
land journals. But some adventures that happened 
to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I must 
not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time 
to see the court -of Spain, and to see what was 
worth observing ; but it being the latter part of the 
summer, we hastened away, and set out from Ma- 
drid about the middle of October. But when we 
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at 
several towns on the way, with an account that so 
much snow was fallen on the French side of the 
mountains;, that several travellers were obligied to 
come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, 
at an extreme hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it 
so indted; and to me, that had been always used 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ITT 

to 131 hot climate, aad indeed to countries where we 
could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insuf- 
ferable; nor« indeed, was it more painful than it was 
surprishig : to come but ten (lays before out of the 
Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, 
but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from 
the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so severely 
cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumb- 
ing and perishing of our fingers and toes, was very 
strange. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the 
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold 
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life. 

To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe- 
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence, 
and so long, that the people said, winter was come 
before its time; and the roads, which were dilRcult 
before, were now quite impassable : in a word, the 
snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel; 
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north- 
em countries, there was no going without being in 
danger of being buried alive every step. We staid 
no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when 
(Seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of 
its being better, for it was the severest winter all 
over Eutope that had been known in many years) 
I proposed that we should all go away to Foatara- 

VOL. II. M

bia, and there take shipping for Bonrdeaux, which 
was a Tery little voyage. 

But while we were considering this^ there came 
in four French gentlemen, vdio having been stop- 
ped on Uie French side of the passes, as we were 
on the Spanish, had foond out a gaide, who, tra- 
versing the country near the head of Languedoe^ 
had brought them over the mountains by such 
ways, that they were not much incommoded with 
the snow; and where they met with snow in any 
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to 
bear them and their horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would 
undertake to carry us the same way, with no ha- 
zard ^m the snow, provided we were armed suf- 
ficiently to protect us from wild beasts: for he 
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for 
some wolves to shew themselves at the foot of the 
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, 
the ground being covered with snow. We told 
him we were well enough prepared for such crea- 
tures as they were, if he would ensure us from a 
kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we 
were in most danger from, especially on the French 
side of the mountains. 

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind 
in the way that we were to go : so we readily agreed 
to follow him ; as did also twelve other gentlemeDk 

10 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179 

with their servants, some French* some Spanish, 
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were 
obliged to come back again* 

Accordingly we all set out from Pampelona, with 
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in- 
deed I was surprised, when, instead of going for- 
ward, he came directly back with us, on the same 
road that we came from Madrid, .above twenty 
miles ; when having passed two rivers, and come 
into the plain country, we found ourselves in a 
warm climate again, where the country was plea- 
sant» and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden^ 
turning to the left, he approached the mountains 
another way ; and though it is true, the hills and 
the precipices looked dreadftilly, yet he made so 
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such 
winding ways, We insensibly passed the height of 
the mountains, without being much incumbered 
with the snow; and all on a sudden he shewed us 
the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and 
Gascoigne, all green and flourishing; though in- 
deed they were at a great distance, and we had 
some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we 
found it snowed one whole day and a night, so-fast, 
that yre could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we 
should soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that 
we began to descend every day, and to come more 



180 TU£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

north than before; and so, depending upon oui 
guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when our 
guide being something before us, and not just in 
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolyes, and after 
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a 
thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the 
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he 
had been devoured indeed, before we could have 
helped him : one of them fastened upon his horse, 
and the other attacked the man with th^t violence, 
that he had not time, or not presence of mind 
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried 
out to us most lustily. ' My man Friday being next 
to me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the 
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the 
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, *' O master ! 
O master !" But, like a bold fellow, rode directly 
up to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf 
that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my 
man Friday ; for he, having been used to that kind 
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him« 
but went close up to him, and shot him as above ; 
whereas any of us would have fired at a farther 
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolO 
or endangered shooting the man. * 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder maa 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 181 

than 1, and indeed it alarmed all our company^ 
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard 
on both sides the dismallest howliogs of wolves, 
and the noise redoubled by the echo of the moun- 
tains, that it was to us as if there had been a pro- 
digious multitude of them; and perhaps indeed 
there was not such a few, as that we had no cause 
of apprehensions. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the 
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left him 
immediately, and fled, having happily fastened 
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had 
stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him 
much hurt : the man, indeed, was most hurt; for 
the raging creature had bit him twice, once on the 
arm, and the other time a little above his knee; 
and' he was just as it were tumbling down by the 
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up and 
shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Fri- 
day's pintol we all mended our pace, and rid up 
as fast as the way (which was very difficult) would* 
give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon 
as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us be- 
fore,- we saw plainly what had been the case, and how 
Friday had disengaged the poor guide ; though we 
did not presently discern what kind of creature it 
was he had killed.

SuT nerer was a fight managed to hardily, and 
in such a surprising manner, as that which followed 
between Friday and the bear, which gave us all 
(though at first we were surprised and afraid for 
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the 
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gal- 
lop as the wolf does, which is swift and light ; so he 
has two particular qualitieii, which generally are 
the rule of his actions : first, as to men, who are 
not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey, be- 
cause though I can't say what excessive hunger 
might do, which was now their case, the ground 
being all covered with snow ; yet as to men, he 
does not usually attempt them, unless they first at*

tack him ; on the contrary, if you meet him in the 
woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't 
meddle with you : yet then you must take care to 
be Tery civil to him, and give him the road ; for 
he is a very nice gentleman, he won't go a step 
out of the way for a prince ; nay, if you are really 
afraid, your best way is to look another way, and 
keep going on ; for sometimes, if you stop, and 
stand still, and look stedfastly at him, he takes it 
for an affront ; and if you throw or toss any thing 
at him, and it hits him« though it were but a bit of 
stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an af- 
front, and sets all other business aside to pursue 
his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point 
of honour, and this is his first quality ; the next ia, 
that if he be once affronted, he will never leave 
you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but fol- 
low at a good round rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and 
when we came up to him, he was helping him off* 
from his horse;. for the man was both hurt and 
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first; 
when on a sudd/en, we espied the bear come out 
of the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the 
biggest by far that ever I saw : we were all a little 
surprised when we saw him ; but when Friday saw 
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel- 
low's countenance ; " O ! O ! O !" says Friday, 



184 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

three times, pointing to him, '' O master ! you 
give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him, me 
makee you good laugh.'' 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased : 
" You fool you,*' said I, " he will eat you up."— 
" Eatee me up ! eatee me up !" says Friday twice 
over again; ''me eatee him up; me make you 
good laugh; you all stay here, me shew you good 
laugh." So down he sits, and gets his boots off in 
a moment, and put on a pair of puraps (as we call 
the flat shoes they Wear,) and which he had in his 
pocktft, and gives my other servant his horse, and 
with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to 
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty 
near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand 
him : " Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, " me 
speakee wit you." We followed at a distance ; for 
now being come down to the Gascoigne side of the 
mountains, we were entered a vast great forest, 
where the country was plain, and pretty open» 
though many trees in it scattered here and there. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, 
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great 
stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on the 
head ; but did him no more harm than if he had 
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's 
end ; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did 



I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 185 

it purely to make the bear follow hiin> and shew 
us some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone^ and saw him« 
he turns about^ and comes after him, taking dei- 
yilish long strides, and shuffling along at a strange 
rate, so as he would put a horse to a middling 
gallop. * Away runs Friday, and takes his course, 
as if he ran towards us for help; so we all resol- 
ved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my 
man; though I was angry at him heartily for 
bringing the bear back upon us, when he was 
going about his own business another way; and 
especially I was angry that he had turned the bear 
upon us, and then run away; and I called out, 
*' You dog,'' said I, *' is this your making us laugh ? 
Come away, and take your horse, that we may 
shoot the creature.*' He hears me, and cries out, 
^* No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much 
laugh;" and as the nimble creature ran two feet 
for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden, on one 
side of us, and seeing a great oak tree, tit for his 
purpose, he beckoned us to follow, and doubling 
his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his 
gun down upon the ground, at about five or six 
yards from the bottom of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and jwe followed 
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stepped 
at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he

eo moQstroas heavy* I was amased at the foUy, 
as I thought it, of my man, and coald not for my 
life see any thing to laugh at yet, till seeing the 
bear get np the tree, we all rode nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got 
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the 
bear got about half way to him. As soon as the 
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree 
was weaker, *' Ha" sajrs he to us, '' now you see 
me teachee the bear dance ;" so he falls a-jumping, 
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began 
to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind 
him, to see how he should get back; then indeed 
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done 
with him by a great deal : when he sees him stand 
still, be calls out to him again, as if he had sup- 
posed the bear could speak English, " What, you 
come no farther ? Pray you come farther.'' So he 
left jumping and shaking the bough : and the bear, 
just as if he understood what he said, did come a 
little farther ; then he fell a*jumping again, and 
the bear stopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him 
on the bead, and called to Friday to stand still, and 
we would shoot the bear ; but he cried out ear- 
nestly, '''O pray ! O pray ! no shoot, me shoot by

tirer, to shorten the story, Friday daaced so much, 
and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laugh- 
ing enough indeed, but still could not imagine 
what the fellow would do; for first we thought he 
depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found 
the bear was too cunning for that too; for he 
would not get out far enough to be thrown down, 
but dings fast with his great broad claws and feet, 
so that we could not ima^ne what would be the 
end of k, -and where the jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for 
seeing the bear cling fest to the bough, and that 
he would .not be persuaded to come any farther; 
** Well, well,'' said Friday ^ you no come farther, 
me go, me go ; you no come to me, me come to 
you ;" and upon this he goes out to the smallest 
end of the bough, where it would bend with his 
weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding 
down the bough, till he came near enough to jump 
down on his feet ; and away he ran to his gun, 
takes it up, and stands still. 

*' Well,*' said I to him, " Friday, what will you 
do now? Why don't you shoot him?" — "lio 
idioot," says Friday, " no yet ; me shoot now me 
no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh; and 
indeed so he did, as you will see presently ; for 
when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back 
from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty

leisurely, looking behind him every step, . and 
coming backward till he got into the body of the 
tree ; then with the same hinder end foremost, he 
came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, 
and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At 
this juncture, and just before he could set his hind 
feet upon the ground, Friday stepped close to him 
clapped the muzle of his piece into his ear, > and 
shot him as dead as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not 
laugh ; and when he saw we were pleased by our 
looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud ; '' So 
we kill bear in my country,'' says Friday. " So you 
kill them ?" said I ; " why, you have no guns.'* 
— '' No," says he, *' no guns, but shoot great much 
long arrow." 

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us ; but 
we were still in a wild place, and our guide very 
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew : the 
howling of wolves ran much in my head ; and in* 
deed except the noise I once heard on the shore ei 
Africa, of which I have said something already, I 
never heard any thing that filled me with so muctt 
horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called 
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we 
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon- 
strous creature off, which was worth saving ; but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened 
us ; so we left him> and went forward on our jour- 
ney. 

. The ground was still covered with snow, though 
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; 
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, 
were come down into the forest and plain country, 
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done 
a great deal of mischief in the Tillages, where they 
9firpnsed the country- people, killed a great many 
of their sheep and horses, and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which 
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves 
in the country, we should fiod them there; and 
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on 
every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which 
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then 
we should come to the village where we were to 
lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we en- 
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, when 
we came ipto the plain. We met with nothing in 
the first wood, except that in a little plain within 
the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, 
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed 
one after abother, as if they had been in chase of 
lomeprey, and had it in view: they ti)ok no notice 



106 TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

i)i m, and were gone and oat of siglit in a feir nu>* 
ments. 

Upon this oar gaide, who, by the way, was a 
wretched faint-hesurted fellow, bade as keep in a 
teady postnre; for he belieyed there were more 
woWes a-coming. 

We kept oar arms ready, and oar eyes about us; 
bat we saw no more woItcs till we came throogh 
that wood, which was near half a league and en** 
tered the plain : as soon as we came into the plain, 
we had occasion enoagh to look aboat as. The 
first object we met with was a dead horBe, that is to 
say, a poor hone which the wolves had killed, and 
at least a dozen of them at woric ; we could not say 
eating of him, but picking of his bones rather; fer 
they had eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their 
feast, neither did they take much notice of us; Fri- 
day would have let fly at them, but I would not 
suflerhim by any means ; for I found we were like 
to have more business upon our hands than we 
were aware of. We were not half gone over the 
plain, but we began to hear the wolyes howl in the 
woods, on our left, in a frightful manner ; and pre- 
sently after we saw about a hundred coming on 
directly towards ub, all in a body, and most of them 
in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by ex- 
perienced ofiicers. I scarce knew in what manner 



OF ROBINSON GAUSOlt 19r 

Co receiTe them ; but fowid to draw oanelves in a 

ckise line, was the only way; 6o we foimed in a 

inoment; but, that we might not have too much 

interraly I ordered, that only eyery pother man 

should fire; and that the othen, who had not fired^ 

should stand ready to give them a second volley 

immediately* if they continued to advance upon 

us; and that then those who had fired at firsts 

should not pretend to load their fusils again, but 

stand ready, with «very one a pistol, for we were 

all armed with a fusil and a pair of pistols each 

man ; so we were, by this method, able to fire six 

vollies, half of us at a time ; however, at present 

we had no necessity ; for upon firing the first vol* 

ley, the enemy made a fiiU stop, being terrified, as 

well with the noise as with the fire ; four of them 

being shot in the head, dropped; several others 

were wounded, and went bleeding ofiC as we could 

see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did 

not immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering 

that I had been told, that the fiercest creatures 

were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all 

our company to halloo as loud as we could, and I 

found the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon 

our shout, they began to retire, and turn about; 

then I ordered a second volley to be fired in their 

rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they 

went to the woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again^ 



m THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and that we might lose no time, we kept going; 
but we had but little more than loaded our ftasAa, 
and put ourselves into a readiness^ when we heard 
a terrible noise in the same wood on our left ; only 
that it was farther onward the sapie way we were 
to go< 

The night was coming on, and the night began 
to be dusky, which made it the worse on our side ; 
but, the noise increasing, we could easily perceive 
that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish 
creatures; and on a sudden, we perceived two or 
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, 
and one on our front, so that we seemed to be sur- 
rounded with them ; however, as they did not fall 
upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we 
could make our horses go, which, the way being 
rery roughs was only a good large trot; and in this 
manner we only came in view of the entrance of 
the wood through which we were to pass, at the 
farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly sur-* 
prised, when, coming near the lane, or pass, we saw 
a confused number of wolves standing just at the 
entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, 
we heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that 
way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle 
on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seven^ 
teen wolves after him full speed : indeed the horse 

11 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19S 

bad the heels of them ; but as we sapposed that he 
could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but 
they would get up with him at last; and no ques- 
tion but they did. 

Here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding 
np to the entrance where the horse came out, we 
found the carcase of another horse, and of two men 
devoured by these ravenous creatures, and of one 
the man was no doubt the same whom we heard 
fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; 
but as to the man, his head, and the upper part of 
his body, were eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what 
course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, 
fi)r they gathered about us presently, in hopes of 
prey ; and I verily believe there were three hun- 
dred of them. It happened very much to our advan- 
tage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a lit* 
tie way from it, there lay some large timber trees, 
which had been cut down the summer before, and 
I suppose lay there for carriage : I drew my little 
troop in among these trees, and placing ourselves 
in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all 
to alight, and, keeping that tree before us for a' 
breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts,* 
inclosing our horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it #as well we did ; for never 
was a more fiirious charge than the creatures made

vpon us in tlm place; Ibey came on un with a 
growling kind of a noise, and mounted the piece 
of timber (which, aa I aaid, was our breastwork), 
as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and 
this fury of theirs, it seekns^ was principally occa- 
sioned by their seeing our horses behind us, which 
was the prey they aimed at I ordered our men to 
fire as before, every man ; and they took thetr aim 
60 sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves 
at the first volley; but there was a necessity to 
keep a continual firing, for they came on like de^ 
vib, those behind pushing on those before. 

When we had fired our second volley of fiisils, 
we thought they stopped a little, and I helped they 
would haTe gone off; but it Was but a nM>ment, for 
ethers came forward again ; so we fired our roffies 
of pistols; and I believe in these four firings we 
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed 
twice as many ; yet they came on again. 

I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ; so 
I called my servant;, not my man Friday, for he 
was b^ter employed; for, with the greatest dex- 
terity imaginable, he charged my fusil and his own 
while we were «igaged ; but^ as I said, I called my 
other man ; and giving him a horn of powder, I 
bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber, 
and let it be a large train ; he did so, and had but 

tioie to get away, when the wolves came up to il«

aad some were got up apoa it; when I, sntpping 
an uncharged pistol dose to the powder^ set it on 
fire; and those that were upon the timber were 
scorched with it, and six or seven of them feU, or 
rather jumped in among us, with the force and 
fright of the fire : we dispatched these in an instant* 
and the rest were so frighted with the light, which 
the night, for now it was very near daric, made 
more terrible, that they drew b^ck a little. 

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired 
ofi* in one volley, and after that we gave a shout : 
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied im- 
' mediately upon near twenty lame ones, which we 
found struggling on the ground, and fell a>cutting 
them with our swords, which answered our expec- 
tation; for the crying and howling they made were 
better understood by their fellows ; so tbat they 
fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore 
of them ; and had it been daylight, we had killed 
many more. The field of battle being thus clear* 
ed, we made forward again ; for we had still near 
a league to go. We heard the ravenous crea- 
tures howl and yell in the woods as we went, seve- 
ral times ; and sometimes we fancied we saw some 
of them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were 
not certain ; so in about an hour more we came to 
the town, where we were to lodge, which w^ found 



m THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in a terrible fHght^ and all in arms; for, it seenify 
that, the night before, the woWes and some bears 
had broken into that village, and pat them in a ter- 
rible fright ; and they were obliged to keep guard 
night and day, bat especially in the night, to pre- 
serve their cattle^ and indeed their people. 

The next morning oar guide was so ill, and his 
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two 
wounds, that he could go no farther ; so we were 
obliged to take a new. guide there, and go to Tho- 
lousei where we found a warn climate, a fruitful, 
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any 
thing like them ; but when we told our story at 
Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what was 
ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the moun- 
tahis, especially when the snow lay on the ground ; 
but they inquired much what kind of a guide we 
had gotten, that would venture to bring us that way 
in such a severe season ; and told us, it was very 
much we were not all devoured^ When we told 
them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in 
the. middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told 
us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroy- 
ed ; for it was the sight of the horses that made 
the wolves so furious, seeing their prey ; and that 
at other times they are really afraid of a gun ; but 
they being excessive hungry^ and raging on that 
account, the eagerness to come at the horses hail 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB^ IVf 

made them senseless of danger ; and that if we had 
Bot by the continued fire, and at last by the strata- 
gem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had 
been great odds but that we bad been torn to pieces ; 
whereas, had we been content to have sat still on 
horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not 
have taken the horses so much for their own, when 
men 'were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal 
they -told us, that at last, if we had stood all to- 
gether, and left our horses, they would have been 
so eager to have devoured them, that we might 
have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms 
in our hands, and being so many in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger 
in my life ; for seeing above three hundred devils 
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, anu 
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave 
myself over for lost ; and as it was, I believe, I 
shall never ' care to cross those mountains again ; 
I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues 
by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storoi 
once a week. 

* I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in 
my passage through France; nothing but what 
other travellers have given an account of, with 
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from 
Tholouse to Paris, and without any considerabte 
stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover*

the fourteenth of Jamuay, after haying had a se* 
▼ere cold season fx> travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and 
had in a little time all my new-discovered estate 
safe about me; the bills of exchange, which I 
brought with me, having been very currently paid. 

My prinbi{>al guide and fHrivy connsellor was my 
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the 
money I had sent her, thought no pains too mocl^ 
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted 
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per- 
fectly easy as to the security of my efiects ; and 
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and 
now to the end, in the unqwtted integrity of this 
good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my efifects 
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and 
so to the Brazils. But now another scruple came 
in the way, and that was religion ; for as I had 
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion» 
even while I was abroad, especially in my state of 
solitude; so I knew there was no going to the 
Brazils for me, much less going to settle there, 
unless I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic 
religion, without any reserve; except, on the other 
hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, 
be a martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition : 
so I resolved to stay at home, and, if I could find 
means Tor it, to dispose of my plantation. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. IM 

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at 
Lisbon, who in return gave me notice, that he 
could easily dispose of it there: but that if I 
thought fit to give him leave to ofifer it in my 
name to the two merchants, the surviyors of my 
trustees, who lived in the Brasils, who must fully 
understand the value of it, who lived just upon the 
•pot, and who I knew to be very rich, so that he 
believed they would be fond of buying it; he did 
not doubt, but I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of 
eight the more of it 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it 
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months 
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an 
account, that they had accepted the oflfer, and had 
remitted S3,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent 
of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it. 

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the 
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to 
my old man, who sent me the biUs of exchange 
for 33,800 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving 
the payment of 100 moidores a year to him (the 
old man) during his life, and 50 moidores after- 
wards to his son for his life, which I had prooused 
them ; and which the piantatiott was to make good 
as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first 
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of 
Providence's chequer- work, and of a variety which 



too TflE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the .world will seldom be able to shew the like of: 
beginning foolishly, but closing much more hap- 
pily than any part of it ever gave me leave so 
much as to hope for. ^ 

Any one would think, that in this state of com- 
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more 
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum- 
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a 
wandering life, had no ^mily, nor many relations; 
nor, however rich, had I contracted much ac- 
quaintance ; and though I had sold my estate in 
the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country out 
of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the 
wing again ; especially I could not resist the strong 
inclination I had to see my island, and to know 
if the poor Spaniards were in being there; and 
how the rogues I left there had used them. 

My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded 
me from it, and so far prevailed with roe, that al- 
most for seven years she prevented my running 
abroad ; during which time I took my two nephews, 
the children of one of my brothers, into my care : 
the eldest having something of his own, I bred 
up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of 
some addition to his estate, after my decease; the 
other I put out to a captain of a ship : and after 
five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterpri- 
sing young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and 



f OF ROBINSQN CRUSO& Ml 

sent htm to sea : aad this young fellow afterwards 
drew me in> as old as I was, to farther adventures 
myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here : 
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my 
disadvantage or dissatisfaction ; and had three chil- 
dren, two sous and one daughter*

That homely proverb used on so many occasions 
ID England, viz. " That what is bred in the bone

fied than in the story of my Life. Any one would 
think, that after thirty-five years affliction, and a

if any, ever went through before, and afi;er near 
seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fiilness 
of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might 
be allowed me to have had experience of every state 
of middle life, and to know which was most adapted 
to make a man completely happy ; I say, after all 
this, any one would have thought that the native 



OF ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 903 

propensity to rambling; which I gare an account of 
in my first setting oat into the world to haye been 
so predominant in my thonghts, should be worn out, 
the volatile pari be fully evacuated, or at least con* 
deused, and I ought at sixty-one years of age have 
been a little inclined to stay at home, and have 
done v(»itaring life and fortune any more. 

Nay farther, the common motive of foreign ad- 
ventures was taken away in me ; for I had no for- 
tane to make, I had nothing to seek : if I had 
gained ten thousand pouoda^ I had been no richer ; 
Ibr I had already sufficient for me, and for those I 
had to leave it to, and that I had was visibly in- 
creasing ; for having no great family, I could not 
spend the income of what I had, unless I would set 
ttp for an expensive way of living, such as a great 
family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, 
which were things I had no notion of, or inclina* 
tion to ; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to 
sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it 
increase daily upon my hands. 

Yet all these things had no efifect upon me, or 
at least not enough to resist the strong inclination 
I had to go abroad again, which huug about me 
like a chronical distemper ; particulariy the desire 
of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the 
colony I left there, run in my head continually. I 
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination run 



fM THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

vpoD it all day; it was uppermost in all my tboiight^ 
and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon 
it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing 
could remove it out of my mind ; it even broke so 
Tiolently into all my discourses^ that it made my 
conversation tiresome; for I could talk of nothing 
else, all my discourse run into it^ even to imperti* 
nence, and I saw it myself. 

I have often heard persons of good judgment 
say, that all the stir people make in the world 
about ghosts and apparitions^ is owing to the 
strength of imagination, and the powerful operation 
of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such thing 
as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the 
like ; that people's poring affectionately upon the 
past conversation of their deceased friends so rea- 
lizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying^ 
upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they 
see them, talk to them, and are answered by them, 
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and va- 
pour in the thing; and they really know nothing 
of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hoar whether 
there are any such things as real apparitions, spec- 
tres, or walking of people after they are dead, or 
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell 
us of that kind, more than the product of vapours> 
sick minds, and wandering fancies. But thi$ I 



DF ROBtNSDN CRUSOfi. «D5 

» 
know, that my imagination worked up to such a 

height, and brought me into such excess of va- 
pours, or what else I may call it, that I actually 
supposed myself oftentimes upon the spot, at my 
old castle behind the trees, saw ray old Spaniard, 
Friday's father, and th^ reprobate sailors whom I 
left upon the island ; nay, I fancied I talked with 
them, and looked at them so steadily, though I was 
broad aWake, as at persons just before me ; and this 
I did till I often frightened myself with the images 
my fancy represented to me : one tinse in my sleep 
I had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so 
lively related to me, by the first Spaniard and Fri- 
day's father, that it was surprising ; they told me 
how they barbarously attempted to murder all the 
Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions 
they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve 
them ; things that I had never heard of, and that 
were yet all of them true in fact; but it was so 
warm in my imagination, and so realized to me, 
that to the hour I saw them, I could not be per- 
suaded but that it was or would be true ; also how 
I resented it when the Spaniard complained to me, 
and how I brought them to justice, tried them be- 
fore me, and ordered them all three to be hanged. 
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its 
place ; for however I came to form such things in 
jgay dreanii and what secret converse of spirits in- 



fi06 THE L1F£ AND ADVENTURES 

jected it> yet there was, I say, very much of it true. 
I own, tint this dream had nothing literally and 
ipecifically true; hut the general part was so true, 
the hase and Tillainous behayiour of these three har- 
dened rogues was such, and had been so much worse 
than all I can describe, that the dream had too 
much similitude of the fact; and as I would after- 
wards haye punished them severely, so if I had 
hanged them all, I had been much in the rights 
and should have been justifiable both by the laws 
of God and man. 

But to return to my story*—- In this kind of tem- 
per I had lived some yeara^ I had no enjoyment of 
my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion 
but what had something or other of Uiis in it ; so 
that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent 
upon i^ told me very seriously one night, that she 
believed there was some secret powerful impulse of 
Providence upon me, which had determined me to 
go thither again ; and that she found nothing hin- 
dered my going, but my being engaged to a wife 
and children. She told me, that it was true she 
could not think of parting with me ; but as shewas 
assured, that if she was dead it would be the fint 
thing I would do ; so, as it seemed to her that the 
thing was detefmined above, she would not be the 
only obstruction ; for if I thought fit, and resolved 
to go Here she found me very intent upoa hmt 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 0OT 

wofds^ aad that I looked very earnestly at her; so 
that it a little disordered her, and she stopped. I 
asked her why she did not go on, and say out what 
die was going to «ay ? Bat I perceived her heart 
was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes: 
" Speak out, my dear/' said I ; '' are you willing 
1 should go ?" " No/* says she, very affection- 
ately, '' I am far from willing : but if you are re- 
solved to go,'* says she, *' and rather than I will be 
the only hinderanoe, I will go with you; for though 
I think it a preposterous thing for one of your years, 
and in your condition, yet if it must be,** said she, 
again weeping, ** I won't leave you ; for if it be of 
Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting it; 
and if Heaven makes it your duty to go, he will 
also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dis- 
pose of me, that I may not obstruct it** 

This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con- 
sider what I was doing ; I corrected my wandering 
&ncy, and began to argue with myself sedately, 
what business I had, after threescore years, and 
after such a life of tedious sufferings and disastem, 
and closed in so happy and easy a manner, I say, 
what business had I to rush into new hazards, and 
pot myself upon adventures, fit only for youth aad 
poverty to run into? 

With those thoughts, I considered my new en- 



908 THE Lire AND ADVENTUHES 

gageroent ; that I had a wife, one child boirn, and 
my wife then great with child of another; that I 
had all the world could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazards for gain ; that I was declining in 
years,* and ought to think rather of leaving what I 
had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as 
to what my wife had said, of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go^ 
I had no notion of that; so after many of these co- 
gitations, I struggled with the power of my imagi- 
nation, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people 
mmf always do in like eases, if they will; and, in a 
word, I conquered it ; composed myself with such 
arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which 
my present condition furnished me plentifully with; 
and particularly, as the most 6f}ectual method, I 
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to 
engage in some business that might efiectnally tie 
me up from any more excursions of this kind; for 
I found the thing return upon me chiefly when I 
was idle, had nothing to do, or any thing of mo- 
ment immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the 
county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself 
thither. I had a little convenient house upon it, 
and the land about it I found was capable of great 
improvement, and that it was many ways suited to 
my inclination^ which delighted in cultivating. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SQi 

managing, planting, and improving of land ; and 
particularly, being an inland country, I was remo- 
ved from conversing among ships, sailors, and 
things relating to the remote part of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, wag- 
gon, horses, cows, sheep ; and setting seriously to 
work, became in one half year a mere country 
gentleman ; my thoughts were entirely taken up in 
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, en* 
closing, planting, &c. ; and I lived, as I thought, 
the most agreeable life tha^ nature was capable of 
directing, or that a man always bred to misfor^^ 
tunes was capable of being retreated to. 

1 farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles ; I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleased ; what 1 planted was for my- 
self, and what I improved was for my family; and 
having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I 
kad not the least discomfort in any part of my 
life, as to this world. Now I thought indeed, that 
I enjoyed' the middle state of life which n^ father 
so earnestly recommended to me, a kind of hea- 
venly life, something like what is described by th^ 
poet upon the subject of a country life : 

Free from vices, free from care, 
Age has no pains, and yoath no snare. 

VOL. Il« O 



910 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once; 
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable 
and incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, 
upon a deep relapse into the wandering disposi- 
tion; which, as I may say, being born in my very 
blood, soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the 
returns of a violent distemper, came on with an ir- 
resistible force upon me; so that nothing could 
make any more impression upon me. This blow 
was the loss of my wife« 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon 
my wife, to give a character of her particular vir- 
tues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery 
of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the 
stay of all my afiairs, the centre of all my enter- 
prises, the engine that by her prudence reduced 
me to that happy compass 1 was in, from the most 
extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in 
my head as above ; and did more to guide my ranv 
blittg genius, than a mother's tears, a father's in- 
structions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reason- 
ing powers could do. I was happy in listening to 
her tears, and in being moved by her entreaties, 
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in 
the world by the loss of her. 

When she was gone the world looked awkward- 
ly round me, J was as much a stranger in it in my 

II 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

thoughts as I was in. the Brazils when I went first 
on shore there ; and as ranch alone, except as to 
the assistance of servants, as I was in my island. 
I knew neither what to do, or what not to do ; I 
«aw the world husy round me, one part labouring 
for bread, and the other part squandering in vile 
excesses or empty pleasures equally miserable, be* 
cause the end they proposed still fled from them ; 
for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their 
vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance, 
and the men .of labour spent their strength in daily 
strugglings for bread to maintain the vital strength 
they laboured with; so living in a daily circulation 
of sorrow^ living but to work, and working but to 
live/ as if daily bread were the only end of a weari- 
some life, and a wearisome life the only occasion 
of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life t lived in my 
kingdom the island, where I sufiered no inore corn 
to grow, because I did not want it ; and bred no 
more goats, because I had no more use for them ; 
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew 
mildewed, and had scarce the favour to be looked 
upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reason and religion had dic- 
tated to me, would have taught me to search far- 
ther than human ei\joyments for a full felicity, and 



2I« THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that there was something which certainly was the 
reason and end of life, superior to all these things* 
and which was either to be possessed, or at least 
hoped for, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone, I was like a 
ship without a pilot, that could only run before the 
wind ; my thoughts run all away again into the old 
aiFdir, my head was quite turned with the whimsies 
of foreign adventures ; and all the pleasing inno^ 
cent amusements of my farm and my garden, my 
cattle and my family, which before entirely pos^ 
sessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, and 
were like music to one that has no ear, or food to 
one that has no taste : in a word, I resolved to leave 
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to Lon- 
don ; and in a few months after I did so. 

When I came to London I was still as uneasy as 
before ; I had no relish to the place, no employ- 
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like 
an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is per- 
fectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one 
farthing matter to the rest of his* kind whether he 
be dead or alive. This also was the thing which 
of all circumstances of life was the most my aver- 
sion, who had been all my days used to an active 
life ; and I would often say to myself, " A state of 
idleness is the very dregs of life ;" and indeed I 
thought I was much more suitably employed when 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE- «!3 

I was twenty-six days making me a deal board. 

It was now the begining of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I 
had brought up to the sea, and had made him 
commander of a ship, was come home from a short 
toyage to 6ilboa» being the first he had made ; he 
came to me, and told me, that some merchants of 
his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go 
a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, 
as private traders ; " And now, uncle," says he, " if 
you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land you 
tipon your old habitation in the island, for we are 
to touch at the Brazils/' 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a fur 
lute state, and of the existence of an invisible 
world, than the concurrence of second causes with 
the ideas of things which we form in our minds, 
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any 
in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distem- 
per of wandering was returned upon me, and I 
knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts to 
say, when that very morning, before he came to 
me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, 
and revolving every part of my circumstances in 
my mind, come to this resolution, viz. that I would 
go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain; 
' and so, if it was rational and practicable, I woul(]i 



«14 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

go and see the island again, and see what i^as be- 
come of my people there, I had pleased myself 
also with the thoughts of peopling the place, and 
carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent 
for the possession, and I know not what ; when in 
the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I 
have said, with his project of carrying me thither, 
in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadi- 
ly at him, " What devil," said I " sent you of this 
tinlucky errand?'* My nephew startled, as if he 
had been frighted at first; but perceiving I was not 
much displeased with the proposal, he recovered 
himself. '' I hope it may not be an unlucky pro- 
posal. Sir," says he; *' I dai*e say you would be 
pleased to see your new colony there, where yoii 
once reigned with more felicity than most <of your 
brother monarchs in the world." 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my 
temper, that is to say, with the prepossession I was 
under, and of which I have said so much, that I 
told him, in a few words, if he agreed with the 
merchants, I would go with him : but I told him I 
would not promise to go any farther than my own 
island. " Why, Sir," says he, *' you don't want to 
be left there again, I hope ?" — *' Why," said I ** can 
you not take me up again in your return ?" He told 
pie, it could not be possible that the merchants 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. f i5 

would allow him to come that way with a loaden 
^ifxof sach yahie, it being a month's sail out of bis 
way, and might be three or four : ^ Besides, Sir^ if 
I should miscarry/' said he, '' and not return at all, 
then you would be just reduced to the conditioii 
you were in before/' 

This was very rational ; but we \»oth found out 
a remedy ior it, which was to carry a framed skK>|» 
on board the ship, which, being taken in pieces 
and dipped on board the ship, might, by the help 
of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with 
us, be set up again in the island, and finished, fit 
to go to sea in a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the iropor- 
tonitiesof my nephew joined in so efifectually with 
my inclination, that nothing could oppose me : on 
the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody 
concermed themselves so much for me, as to per- 
suade me one way or other, except my ancient good 
friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me 
to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless hazard of a long voyage; and, above 
all, my young children : but it was all to no pur- 
pose; I had an irresistible desire to the voyage; 
and I told her I thought there was something so 
uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind 
for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting 
Proyidence, if I should attempt to stay at home ^ 



916 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURIDS 

after which she ceased her expostulations, and join* 
ed with me, not only in making provision for. my 
voyage, but also in settling my family affairs in my 
absence, and providing for the education of my 
qhildren. 

In order to this I made my will, and settled the 
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and 
placed in such hands^ that I was perfectly easy and 
satisfied they would have justice done them, what- 
ever might befall me; and for their education, I 
left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient main- 
tenance to herself for her care; all which she rich- 
ly deserved; for no mother could have taken more 
care in their education, or understood it better; and 
as she lived till I came home, 1 also lived to thank 
her. for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the begin- 
ning of January 1694 5, and I with my man Fri- 
day went on board in the Downs the 8th, having, 
besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very 
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things 
for my colony, which if I did not find in good con- 
dition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me* some servants, whom* I 
purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least 
to set on work there upon my own account while I 
stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry 
^bem forward, as they should appear willing ; par- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

ticalarly, I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a 
Tery handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by 
trade, bat was also a general mechanic ; for he was 
dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind 
corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker; he 
also made any thing that was proper to make of 
earth, or of wood ; in a word, we called him our 
Jack of all Trades. 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered 
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our 
4iew plantation, and proved a most necessary handy 
fellow as could be desired, in many other busi- 
nesses besides that of his trade ; for, as I observed 
formerly, necessity arn^s us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have 
BOt kept an account of the particulars, consisted of 
a sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin Eng- 
lish staffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected 
to find there, and enough of them as, by my calcu- 
lation, might comfortably supply them for seven 
years : if I remember right, the materials which I 
carried for clothing them> with gloves, hats, shoes, 
stockings, and all such things as they could want 
for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, 
including some beds, bedding, and household-stufi^ 
particularly kitchen utensils, vvith pots, kettles, 
pewter, brass, &c^ besides near a hundred pounds 



218 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

more id iron-work, nails, tools of every kind, staf^ 
hooks, hinges, and every necessary thmg I coaU 
Uiink of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, 
and fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable 
quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of 
lead, and twb pieces of brass cannon; and because 
I knew not what time and what extremities I was 
providing for, I carried an hundred barrels of pow- 
der, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iioa part 
of some pikes and halberts ; so that, in short, we 
had a large magazine of all sorts of stores ; and L 
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck 
guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave be- 
hind if there was occasion ; that when they came 
there we might buiM a fort, and man it against 
all sorts of enemies: and indeed I at first thought 
there would be need enough of it all, and much 
more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of 
the island, as shall be seen in the course of the 
story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as 1 had 
been used to meet with ; and therefore shall have 
the less occasion to interrupt the reader, who per- 
haps may be impatient to hear how matters went 
with my colony; yet some odd accidents, «ro6s 
winds, and bad weather, happened on this first set^ 
ting out, which made the voyage longer than I ex- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lkl« 

pected it at first; and I^ who had never nade bat 
one voyage^ viz, my first voyage to Guinea, in which 
I might be said to come back again as the voyage 
wad at first designed, begaif to think the same ill 
fate still attended me ; and that I was bom to be 
never contented with being on shore, and yet to 
be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward^ 
and we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ire- 
land, where we lay wind-bound two-and-thirty 
days : but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, 
that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in 
the utmost plenty ; so that while we lay here we 
never touched the ship's stores, but rather added 
to them : here also I took several hogs, and two 
cows with their calves, which I resolved, if I had 
a good passage, to put on shore in my island ; but 
we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5 th of February from Ireland, 
and had a very fair gale of wind for some days ; 
as I remember, it might be about the 20th of 
February in the evening late, when the mate ha- 
ving the watch, came into the round-house, and told 
us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired ; 
and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in, 
and told us the boatswain heard another. This 
made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where 
for a while we heard nothing, but in a few minutes 



«0 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we saw a very great light, and found that there 
was some very terrible fire at a distance. Imme- 
diately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which 
we all agreed that there could be no land that way 
in which the fire shewed itself, no, not for five 
hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. 
Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on 
fire at §ea; and as by our hearing the noise of guns 
just before, we concluded it could not be &r ofi^ we 
stood directly towards it, and were presently satis- 
fied we should discover it, because the farther we 
sailed the greater the light appeared, though the 
weather being ha^y we could not perceive any 
thiug but the light for a while : in about half an 
hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us,. though 
not much oi' it, and the weather clearing up a little, 
we could plainly discern that it was a great ship 
on fire in the middle of the sea. 

J was most sensibly touched with this disaster, 
though not at all acquainted with the per^ns en- 
gaged in it; I presently recollected my former 
circumstances, in what condition I was in when 
taken up by the Portugal captain; and how much 
more deplorable the circumstances of the poor 
creatures belonging to this ship must be if they had 
no other ship in company with them : upon this I 
immediately ordered that five guns should be fired* 
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 221 

give notice to them that there was help for them 
at haad^ and that they might endeayour to save 
themselves in their boat ; for though we could see 
the flame in the ship, yet they, it being night, 
could see nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as 
the burning ship drove, waiting for day -light; 
when on a sudden, to our great terror, though we 
had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, 
and immediately sunk. This w&s terrible, and in- 
deed an adlicting sight, for the sake of the poor 
men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed 
in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in their 
boats in the middle of the ocean, which, at pre- 
sent, by reason it was dark, I could not see : how- 
ever, to direct them as well as I could, I caused 
lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship 
where we could, and which we had lanterns for, 
and kept firiug guns all the night long; letting 
them know by this, that there was a ship not far 
off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we disco** 
vered the ship's boats, by the help of our per- 
spective-glasses ; and found there were two of 
them, both thronged with people, and deep in the 
water ; we perceived they rowed, the wind being 
against them ; that they saw our ship, and did the 
utmost to make us see them. 



W THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

We immediately spread our ancient to let them 
know we saw them ; and hung a waft out, as a sig- 
nal for them to come ou board ; and then made 
more sail^ standing directly to them. In a little 
more than half an hour we came up with' them, 
and in a word took them all in, being no less than 
sixty-four men, women, and children; for there 
were a great many passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found' it was a French mer- 
chant-ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bound 
from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master 
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, 
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence 
of the steersman ; but, on his crying out for help, 
was, as every body thought, entirely put out : but 
they soon found that some sparks of the first fire 
had gotten into some, part of the ship, so difficult 
to coine at, that they could not efiectually quench 
it ; and aftervi^ards getting in between the timber^, 
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded 
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the 
application they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into 
their boats, which, to their great comfort, were 
pretty large ; being their long-boat, and a great 
gallop, besides a small skifi^ which was of no great 
service to them, other than to get some fresh 
water and provisions into her, after they h^d se« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOIS. 228 

cured themseWes from the fire. They had indeed 
small hope of their lives by getting into these 
boats at that distance from any land ; only, as they 
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and 
had a possibility, that some ship might happen to 
be at sea; and might take them in. They had 
sails, oars, and a compass ; and were preparing to 
make the best of their way to Newfoundland, the 
wind blowing pretty fair ; for it blew an easy gale 
at S. £. by E. They had as much provisions and 
water, as, with sparing it so as to be next door to 
starving, might support them about twelve days ; 
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con- 
trary winds, the captain said, he hoped he might 
get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might per- 
haps take some fish to sustain them till they might 
go on shore. But there were so many chances 
against them in all these cases ; such as storms to 
overset and founder them ; rains and cold to be- 
numb and perish their limbs; contrary winds to 
keep them out and starve them; that it must have 
been next to miraculous if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consultations, every one 
being hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain, 
with tears in his eyes, told me, they were on a sud- 
den surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, 
and after that four more ; these were the five guns 
which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light: 



ri4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

this revived their hearts, and gave them the notice 
which, as above^ I designed it should, viz. that 
there was a ship at hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing these guns, that they 
took down their masts and sails ; and the sound 
coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by 
till morning. Some time after this, hearing no 
more guns, they fired three muskets, one a consi- 
derable while after another ; but these, the wind 
being contrary', we never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were still more 
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and 
hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused 
to be fired all the rest of the i\ight : this set them 
to work with their oars to keep their boats ahead, 
at least that we might the sooner come up with 
them ; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they 
found we saw them. 

It jfs impossible for me to express the several 
gestures, the strange ecstacies, the variety of pos- 
tures, which these poor delivered people run into, 
to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected 
a deliverance ; grief and fear are easily described ; 
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of head 
and hands, make up the sum of its variety : but an 
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand ex- 
travagances in it; there were some in tears, some 
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been 



^ OF ROBINSON CRUS6E. ^S 

in the greatest agoniei <$f sbfrow; some stark ra-i 
ying and downright lunatic; some ran abont th6 
ship stamping with their feet> others wringing 
their hands; some were dancings several singing, 
some laughing, more crying: many quite damb^ 
not able to speak a word ; others sick and vomit- 
ing, several swooning, and ready to fdint; and a 
few were crossing themselves, and giving God 
thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither; there might 
be many that were thankful afterward; but the 
passion was too strong for them at Brst, and they 
were not able to master it ; they were thrown into 
ecstacies and a kind of frenzy, and so there were but 
a very few who were composed and serious in their 
joy. 

Perhaps also the case may have some addition 
to it, from the particular circumstance of the nation 
they belonged to ; I mean the French, whose tem- 
per is allowed to be more volatile^ more passionate, 
and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, 
than of other nations. I am not philosopher to de- 
termine the CAme, but nothing I had ever seen 
before came up to it : the ecstasies poor Friday, 
my trusty savage, was in, when he found his father 
in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the sur- 
prise of the master, and his two companions, whom 
I delivered from the two villains that set them on

n$ THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

shore in the island, came a little way towards it ; 
but nothing was to compare to this, either that I 
saw in Friday, or any where else in my life. 

It is farther observable, that these extravagan-^ 
ces did not shew themselves in that different man- 
ner I have mentioned, in difierent persons only : 
but all the variety would appear in a short succes- 
sion of moments, in one and the same person. A 
man that we saw this minute dumb, and as it. were 
stupid and confounded, should the next minute be 
dancing and hallooing like an antic ; and the next 
moment a-tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to 
pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a 
madman ; a few minutes after that, we should have 
him all in tears, then sick, then swooning; and had 
not immediate help been had, would in a few mo- 
ments more have been dead ; and thus it wag, not 
with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with, the 
greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, our 
surgeon was obliged fto let above thirty of them 
blood. 

There were two priests among them, one an okl 
man, and the other a young man ^ and that which 
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the 
worst. 

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, 
and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, 
tm all appearance; not the least sign of life could 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 8ST 

be perceived in him ; our sargeon immediately ap- 
plied proper remedies to recover him ; and was the 
only man in the ship that believed he was not 
dead : and at length he opened a vein in his arm, 
having first chafed and rubbed the part> so as to 
warm it as much as possible : upon this the blood, 
which only dropped at first, flowed something 
freely ; in three minutes afler the man opened his 
eyes; and about a quarter of an hour after that he 
spoke, grew better, and, in a little time, quite well; 
afler the blood was stopped, he walked about, told 
us he was perfectly well, took a dram of cordial 
which the surgeon gave him, and was, what we 
called, come to himself; about a quarter of an 
hour after this they came running into the cabia 
to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman 
that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone 
stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the 
change of his circumstances in his mind, and this 
put him into an ecstacy of joy : his spirits whirled 
about faster than the vessels could convey them; 
the blood grew hot and feverish ; and the man viras 
as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was ia 
it; the surgeon would not bleed him again in that 
condition, but gave him something to doze and put 
him to sleep, which, af)»r some time« operated 
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly 
composed and welL 



nB THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The younger priest behaved himself with great 
command of his passion, and was really an ex- 
ample of a serious, well-goTeraed mind ; at his first 
coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on 
bis face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for his 
.deliverance ; in which I unhappily and unseason- 
ably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in 
a swoon : but he spoke calmly ; thanked me ; told 
me he was giving God thanks for his deliverance ; 
begged me to leave him a few moments, and that 
next to his Maker he would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and 
not only led him, but kept others from interrupt- 
.ing him also ; he continued in that posture about 
Ahree minutes, or a little more, after I left him, 
tiaexk came to me, as he had said he would, and 
with a great deal of seriousness and afiection, but 
with tears in his eyes, thanked me that had, under 
God, given him and 'so many miserable creatures 
their lives : I toki him, I had no room to move him 
to thanlc God for it rather than me ; for I had seen 
that he had done t^at already : but I added, that 
it was nothing but what reason and humanity dic- 
tated to all men, and that we had as much reason 
as he to give thanks to God» who had blessed us sq 
far as to make us the instruments of his mercy to 
many of his creatures. 

After this the young priest applied himself tq 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8S9 

hb country-folks ; laboured to coovpose thenr; per- 
suaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and 
did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of 
their reason ; and with some he had success, though 
others were, for a time, out of kll government of 
themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per- 
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it 
may fall, in the guiding themselres in all the ex- 
travagances of their passions ; for if an excess of 
joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the 
reach of their reason, what will not the extrava- 
gances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry 
us to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping 
an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, 
as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of soif- 
row and anger. 
We were something disordered by these extrava- 
gances among our new guests for the first day; but 
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for 
them as well as our ship would allow, and they 
had slept heartily, as most of them did, being fa- 
tigued and frightened, they were quite another sort 
of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledge- 
ments for the kindness shewn them, was wanting ; 
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough 
to exceed that way. The captain and one of the 



SSO THE UfE AND ADVENTURES 

priests came to me the next day ; and, desiring to 
speak with me and my. nephew, the commander 
began to consult with us what should be done with 
them ; and first they told us, that as we had saved 
their, lives, so all they had was little enough for a 
return to us for the kindness received. The cap* 
tain said, they had saved some money, and some' 
things of value in their boats, catched hastily out 
of the flames: tod if we would accept it, they were 
ordered to make an oflfer of it all to us ; they only 
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, 
where, if possible, they might get a passage to 
France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at 
first word, and to consider what to do with them af- 
terwards ; but I over*ruled him in that part ; for I 
knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange 
country ; and if the Portugal captain that took me 
up at sea had served me so, and took all 1 had for 
my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been 
as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at 
Barbary, the being sold to a Mahometan only ex- 
cepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much 
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a 
much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had 
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but 
that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. «S1 

oreatares^ and as we would desire to be so delivered, 
if we were in the like or any other extremity; that 
we had done nothing for them but what we belie- 
ved they would have done for us if we had been in 
their case and they in ours ; but that we took them 
up to serve them, not to plunder them ; and that it 
would be a most barbarous thing, to take that little 
from them which they had saved out of the fire^ 
and then set them on shore and leave them ; that 
this would be first to save them from death, and 
then kill them ourselves; save them from drowning, 
and then abandon them to starving; and therefore 
I would not let the least thing be taken from them : 
as to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that 
was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship 
was bound to the East Indies ; and though we were 
driven out of our course to the westward a rery 
great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven 
on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impos* 
sible for us wilfully to change our voyage on th's 
particular siccount; nor could my nephew, tlje 
captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he 
was under charter-party to pursue his voyage i>y 
he way of Brazil; and all I knew he could do for 
ihem was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting 
with other ships homeward-bound from the West 
Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to Eng^ 
land or France, 



tSi THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The first part of the proposs^l was so generous and 
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it ; 
but t^ey were in a great consternation, especially 
the ps|ssengers« at t^e notion of being cairied away 
to the East Indies : they then entreated me, that 
peeing I was driven so far to the westward before I 
saet ^jiih theory I would at least keep on the same 
course \o the banks of Newfoundland, where it was 
pqasible I might meet with some ship or sloop that 
jthey might hire to carry them back to panada, from 
whence they csgoae* 

I thought this was b\it a reasonable request on 
Iheir pa^ and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for 
indeed I considered, that to c^^rry this whole com- 
pany to tl^e East Indies would not Qnly be an into- 
lerable severity to the poor people, but would be 
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our pro- 
visions ; so I thought it no breach of charter-party, 
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely 
necessary to us; and in vi^ich no one could say we 
were to blame ; for the la\f s of God and nature 
would have forbid, that we should refuse to take 
up two boats full of pieople in such a distressed 
condition ; and the nature of the thing, as well re- 
specting ourselves, as the poor people, obliged us 
to see them pn shore somewhere or pther, for their 
deliverance ; so I consented that we would carry 
them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOS. 9S^ 

permit; and, if not, that I would carry them to 
Martinico in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea- 
ther pretty good ; and as it had blowed continu- 
ally in the points between N. £. and S. £. a long 
time, we missed several opportunities of sending 
them to France ; for we met several ships bound 
to Europe, whereof two were French, from St Chris* 
topher's; but they had been so long beating up 
against the wind, that they durst take in no pas- 
sengers for fear of wanting provisions for the 
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they 
should take in ; so we were obliged to go on. It 
was a(>out a week af^er this, that we made the 
banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my 
story, we put all our French people on board a 
bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them oi| 
shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if 
they could get provisions to victual themselves 
with : when, I say, all the French went on shore, 
J should remember that the young priest I spoke 
of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, de- 
sired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on 
shore on the coast of Coromandel: I readily agreed 
to that ; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had 
very good reason, as will appear afterwards; also 
four of the seamen entered themselves in our ship, 
and proved very useful fellows.

f ROM hence we directed our course for the West 
Indies, steering away S. and S. by £• for about 
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind 
at all, when we met with another subject for our 
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as 
that before^ 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N. 
and the 19th day of March 1684-5, when we 
espied a sail, our course S.£. and by S. We soou 
perceived it was a large vessel, and that she boiv 
lip to us ; but could not at first know what to make 
•f her, til]^ after coming a little nearer, we found 




or ItOBlKSON CHUSOB. 835 

she had lost her main- topmast, foremast, and bow- 
sprit ; and presently she fires a gun as a signal of 
distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at N. 
N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak 
with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home 
from Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the 
road at Barbadoes, a few days before she was 
ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the 
captain and chief mate were both gone on shore ; 
so that, beside the terror of the storm, they were 
but in an indifferent case for good artists to bring 
the ship home; they had been already nine weeks 
at sea, and had met with another terrible storm 
ailer the hurricane was over, which had blown 
them quite out of their knowledge to the westward, 
and in which they had lost their masts, as above; 
they told us, they expected to have seen the Baha- 
ma Islands, but were then driven away again to 
the south-east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. 
W. the same that blew now, and having no sails to 
work the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind 
of square sail upon a jury-foremast, which they had 
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were 
endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all, was, that they 
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides 
the fatigues they had undergone; their bread and 



8S0 THE tIF£ AND ADVENTURES 

flesh was quite gone, they bad not an ounce left 
in the ship, -and had had none for eleven days; the 
only relief they had, was, their water was not aQ 
spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour 
left; they had sugar enough; some succades or 
sweetmeats they had at first, but they were devour- 
ed; and they had seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid- 
servant, on board, who were going passengers, and 
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily 
came on board the evening before the hurricane 
began ; and, having no provisions of their o^n \eh, 
they were in a more deplorable condiiion than the 
rest; for the seamen, being reduced to such an ex* 
treme necessity themselves, had no compassion, wo 
may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they 
were indeed in a condition that their misery is very 
hard to describe. • 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curi- 
osity had not led me, the weather being fair, and 
the wind abated, to go on board the ship : the se- 
cond mate, who upon this occasion commanded the 
ship, had been^n board our ship; and he told me 
indeed, that they had three passengers in the great 
cabin, that they were in a deplorable condition^ 
•* Nay," says he, ** I believe they are dead, for I 
have heard nothing of them for above two days; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SSX' 

and I was afraid to inquire after them" said he, 
*f for I had nothing to relieve them with.'' 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them 
what relief we could spare ; and indeed I had so 
hr over-mled things vrith my nephew, that I would 
have victualled them, though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to 
have supplied ourselves ; but there was no neces* 
sity for that. 

'But now they were in a new danger, for they 
were afraid of eating too much, even of that little 
we gave them. The mate or commander brought' 
six men with him in his boat, but these poor- 
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak» 
they could hardly sit to their oars; the mate him- 
self was very ill, and half starved, for he declared 
be had reserved nothing from the men, and went 
share and share alike with them in every bit they 
ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat 
before him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and out of 
order; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mix- 
ed him up something with some*broth, which he 
said ^ould be to him both food and physic ; and 
after he had taken it, he grew better : in the mean 
lime I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be 



Si8 THE LIFE AND ADYfiNTURES 

given theniy and the poor creatures rather deToar«> 
ed than ate it; they were so exceeding hangry> 
that they were in a manner ravenous* and had no 
command of themselves ; and two of them ate witb 
BO much greediness that they were in danger of 
their lives the next rooming. 

The sight of these people's distress was very mo- 
ving to me, and brought to mind what I had a ter- 
rible prospect of at my first coming on shore in my 
island, where I had not the least mouthful of food, 
or any hopes of procuring it ; besides the hourly 
apprehension I had of being made the food of 
other creatures. But all the while the mate wa» 
thus relating to me the miserable condition of the 
ship^s company, I could not put out of my thought 
the story he had told roe of the three poor creatures 
in the great cabin ; viz. the roother, her son, and 
the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of 
for two or three days ; and whom he seemed to 
confess they had wholly neglected, their own ex- 
tremities being so great ; by which I understood, 
that they had really gtyen them no food at all; and 
that therefore they must be perished, and be all 
lying dead perhaps on the floor or deck of the 
cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then 
called captain, on board with his men to refresh. 
them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. t39 

were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go 
sOn board the ship, and with my mate and twelve 
men to carry them a sack of bread, and four or five 
pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the 
men to cause the meat to be boiled while they 
stayed> and to keep guard in the cook-room, to 
prevent the men's taking it to eat raw, or taking it 
out of the pot before it was well boiled, and then 
to give every man but a little at a time ; and by 
this caution he preserved the men, who would 
otherwise have killed themselves with that very 
food that was given them on purpose to save their 
lives* 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor 
passengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com- 
fort them and give them what refreshment was 
proper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher 
with some of the prepared broth which he had gi« 
yen the mate that was on board, and which he did 
not question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said aboveu 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, 
which I knew the ship itself would present me 
with, in a more lively manner than I could have it 
by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we 
now called him, with me« and went myself a little 
after in their boat. 



'S40 THE LIFE AXD ADVENTURES 

I found the poor men on board almost in a ta- 
malt to get the victuals oat of the boiler before 
it was ready ; bat my mate observed his order> and 
kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the 
man he placed there, after using all possible per^^ 
suasion to have patience, kept them off by force : 
however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped 
in the pot, and softened them with the liquor or 
the meat, which they call brewis, and gave every 
one one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it 
was for their own safety that he was obliged to give 
them but little at a time. But it was all in vain, 
and had I not come on board, and their own com- 
mander and officers with me, and with good words, 
and some threats also of giving them no more, I 
believe they would have broke into the cook-room 
by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace ; for 
words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry 
belly : however, we pacified them, and fed them 
gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the 
next time gave them more, and at last filled their 
bellies, and the men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the ca- 
bin was of another nature, and far beyond the rest; 
for as, firsts the ship^s company bad so little for 
themselves, it was but too true, that they had at 
first kept them very low, and at last totally ne^ 
glected them ; so that for six or seven days i^ 



6F ilOBlNSON CRUSOE. MI 

might be said, they had really had no food at all» 
and for several days before, very little. 

The poor' mother, who, as the first mate re- 
ported, was a woman of good sense and good breed- 
ing, had spared all she could get so affectionately 
for her son, that at last she entirely sank under it; 
and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat 
upon the floor or deck, with her back up against 
the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed 
fast, and her head sunk in between her shoulders, 
like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate 
said all he could to revive and encourage her, and 
with a spoon put some broth into her mouth ; she 
opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could 
not speak : yet she understood what he said, and 
made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late 
for her ; but pointed to her child, as if she would 
have said, they should take care of him. 

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the 
broth into her mouth ; and, as he said, got two or 
three spoonfuls down,, though I question whether 
he could be sure of it or not ; but it was too late, and 
she died the same nighty 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of 
his most affectionate mother's life, was not so far 
gone ; yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched 
out, with hardly any life left in him; he had a

piwe of aiii ^ g^^fl >a ^ mouth, taaTing eaten 
up the rest of it ; however, being yousg, and ha* 
vng note atenglh than his mother, the mate got 
aomethiiig dawtt ltt» throal, and he began aenaibly 
tft revive, thooghb by giving him aone time after 
but two or three spoonfbb ^KtmordlQary, he was 
Tery skk^ and bron^t it up again. 

Bnt the next care vras the poor maid ; she lay 
^1 along upon the deck hard by her mistrett^ and 
just like one that had fallen down with an apc^lexy* 
and stru^led lor life : her limbs were distorted, one 
of her hands was clasped round the frame of 
one chair, and die griped it so hard, that we could 
not eastty make her let it go ; her other arm lay 
over her head, and her feet lay both together, set 
feet against the frame of the cabin-table ; in short, 
she lay just like one in the last agonies of death ; 
and yet she was alive too. 

The poor cieatore was not mdy starved with 
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of deaths 
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken- 
hearted for her mistress^ whom she saw dying two 
or three days before^, and whom she loved most 
tenderly. 

We knew not whfllt to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, and with great applica^ 
tion recovered her as to lif^ he had her upon his 

3

hand as to her venfltt; fer ^ ^vias Mile 1^ thsM 
distracted for a considerable time after, as sh^ 
appear presently. 

Whoever shall read these laetnoranduhitfi teusft 
be desired to consider, that visits at sea are not Itlse 
a journey into the country, where sometimes peo^ 
pie stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our busi« 
ness was to retieve this distressed ship's crew, but 
not lie by for them ; and though they were Willing 
to steer the same course with us for some days, yet 
we could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship 
that had no masts : however, as their captain beg* 
ged of us to help him to set up a main-topmast, 
and a kind of topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, 
as it were, lie by him for three or four days, and 
then hiving given him five barrels of beef sind 
pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion oF 
pease, flour, and what other things we could spstre ; 
and taking three casks of sugar and some rum, and 
some pieces of eight of them for satisfoctioui we 
left them, taking on board with us, at their cywn 
earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all 
their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, 
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth; 
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, 
as it seems, had lost his father but a few months 
before at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon 



944 THE hlFE AND ABYENTVRES 

to speak to me, to take him out of the ship } for 
he said, the cruel fellows had murdered his mother^ 
and indeed so they had» that is to say, passively f 
for they might have spared a small sustenance to 
the poor helpless widow* that might have preserved 
her life, though it had been just to keep her alive. 
But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, 
BO right; and therefore is remorseless^^ and capable 
of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were goings 
and how it would carry him away from all his 
friendsj and put him perhaps in as bad circumstan- 
ces, almost, as we found them in; that is to say, 
starving in the world. He said he mattered not 
whither he went, if he was but delivered from the 
terrible crew that he was among : that the captain 
(by which he meant me, for he could know nothing 
of my nephew) had saved his. life, and he was sure 
would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was 
sure, if she came to herself, she would be very thank- 
ful for it, let us carry them whither we would. The 
surgeon represented the case so affectionately to 
me, that I yielded, and we took them both on board 
with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of su- 
gar, which could not be removed, or come at; and 
as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made 
bis commander sign a writing, obliging him to go, 
as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr Rogers, a, 

I 



6F ROBINSON GRUISO& - S4ft 

merchant there, to whom the youth said he was r&i- 
lated, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, 
and all the goods he had belonging to the decea- 
sed widow ; which I suppose was not done ; for I 
could never learn that the ship came to Bristol; but 
was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so 
disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that 
I am of opinion, the first storm she met with afVer* 
wards she might founder in the sea ; for she was 
leaky, and had damage in her hold when I met 
with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32min. and 
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, 
though at first the winds had been contrary. I shall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, 
weather, currents, &c. on the rest of our voyage j 
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to 
follow, shall observe, that I came to my old habi« 
tation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1095. It 
was with no small difficulty that I found the place; 
for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the 
south and east side of the island, as coming from 
the Brazils; so now coming in between the main 
and the island, and having no chart for the coast, 
nor any land*mark, I did not know it when I saw 
it, or know whether I saw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore 
•a several islands in the mouth of the great river

a ridge of islands reaching from one to the other 
Side of the extended month of that great river; 
and that the savages who came to my island, were 
not properly those which we call Caribeefl|» bat

who inhabited something nearer to our side than 
Me rest* 

In short, I visited several of the islands to no pur-

not On one of tbem I foui^d some Spaniards, and 
thought they had lived there ; but speaking with 
thiem, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek 
hard by, and that they came thither to make salt, 
and catch some pearl-mossel?, if they could ; but 
they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay 
further north, in the latitude of 10 and 1 1 degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, some- 
times with the ship, sometimes with the Fi^ench- 
man's shallop (which we had found a convenient 
boat, and therefore kept her with their very good 
will,) at length I came fair on the south side of my 
island, and I presently knew the very countenance 
ef the place ; so I brought the ship safe to an anchor

with the little cttek wheie was my old 
habitation. 

As flooa 9M I B9m the place> I called for Friday^ 
and asked him^ if he knew whefe he was? He looic* 
ed about a little, and presently clapfHng his hands, 
cried, ^ O yes, O th^e, O yes, O there !'' pointing 
to our old habitation, and fell a dancing and c»per« 
ing like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep 
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to 
the place. 

« Well, Friday,'' said I, ^ do you think w« sfaaM 
find any body here, or no? and what do yon think, 
shall we see your father ?** The fellow stood mute 
as a stock a good while ; but when I named his 
fa^er, the poor affectionate creature looked dejec- 
ted; and I could see the tears run down hts face 
Teiy plentifully. ^ What is the matter, Friday ^ 
said I; " are you troubled bacauae you may see 
your father ?''— ^^ No, no,'' says he, shakiog his 
head, '^ no see him more, no ever more see again.'*

die ; long ago, he much old man."— ^ Well, well,*' 
said I, ^ Fnday, you don't know: but shall we see 
any one eke then ?" Tlie fellow, it seems, had better 
eyes than I, and he points just to the hill aboye 
my old house; and though we lay half a league 
oS^ he cries out, '* Me see! me see! yes, yes, me

tee much man there^ and tliere» and there*'' I 
looked^ but I could see nobody^ no, not with a per- 
spective-glass; which was, I suppose, because I 
could not hit the place ; for the fellow was rights 
as I found upon inquiry the next day, and there 
were five or six men all together stood to look at 
the ship, not knowiog what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I 
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired 
three guns, to give them notice we were friends; 
and about half a quarter of an hour after, we per- 
ceived a smoke rise firom the side of the creek ; so 
I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday 
with me; and hanging out a white flag, or a flag 
of truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me 
the young friar I mentioned, to whom I bad told 
the whole story of my living there, and the manner 
of it, and every particular both of myself and those 
that I left there, and who was on that account ex- 
tremely desirous to go with me. We had besides 
about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found 
any new. guest there which we did not know of; 
but we h^d no need of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near 
high water, we rowed directly into the creek; and 
the first man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard 
whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his 
face perfectly well; as to his habit, I sl^U describe

it aftervrards. I ordered no body to go on shore afc 
first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday 
in the boat.; for the aflfectionate creature had spied 
his father at a distance^ a good way off of the 
Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him; and 
if they had not let him go on shore he would have 
jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, 
bat he flew away to his father like an ariow out of 
a bow. It would have made any man shed tears 
in spite of the firmest resolution, to have seen the 
first transports of this poor fellow's joy, when he 
came to his father ; how he embraced him, kissed 
him, stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set 
him down upon a tree, and lay down by him ; thea 
stood and looked at him as any one would look at 
a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together; 
then lay down upon the ground, and stroked 
his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again, 
and stared at him; one would have thought the 
fellow bewitched : but it would have mad^ a dog 
laugh to see how the next day his passion run out 
another way : in the morning he walked along the 
shore, to and again, with his father, several hours, 
always leading him by the hand as if he had been 
a lady ; and every now and then would come to 
fetch something or other for him from the boat^ 
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or 
fiomething^or other that was good. In the afternQo^ 



t80 THB hirn AND ADYEKTURES 

kis irolict ran another way ; for then he would let 
the old man down upon ^ groond, and dance 
about him, and made a thousand antic postoies and 
gestures; and all the while he did this he would be 
talking to him, and telling him one story or another 
of his travels, and of what had happened to him 
abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial 
affection was to be found in Christians to their par 
rents in our parts of the world, one would be tempt- 
ed to say there hardly would have been any need 
of the fifth commandment 

But this is a digression ; I return to my landing. 
It would be endless to take notice of all the cere* 
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me 
with* The first Spaniard whom, as I said, I knew 
very well, was he whose life I saved : he came to- 
wards the boat attended by one more, canying a 
flag of truce also ; and he did not only not know 
me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of 
its being me that was come till I spoke to him. 
^Seignior,'' said I, in Portuguese, ''do you not 
know me t" at which he spoke not a word ; but 
giving his musket to the man that was with him» 
threw his arms abroad, and saying something in 
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came for- 
ward, and embraced me, telling me, he was inex- 
cusable not to know that face again that he had 
once seen, as of an angel firom Heaven sent to

^ave bis life : he said abundance of very handsome 
things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how; 
^d then beckoning to the person that attended 
him^ bade him go and call out his comrades. He 
tben asked me if I would walk to my old habita- 
tion, where he would give' me possession of my 
own house again, and where I should see there had 
been but mean improvements; so I walked along 
ivith him; but, alas! I could no more find the 
place again than if I had never been there ; for they 
}iad planted so many trees, and placed them in 
^uch a posture, so thick and close to one another^ 
in ten years time they were grown so big, that, in 
#hort, the place was inaccessible, except by sacb 
landings and blind ways as they themselves only 
who made them could find. 

J asked them, what put them upon all these for* 
tifications? He told me, I would say there was 
need enough of it, when they had given an account 
bow they had passed their time since their arriving 
in the island, especially after they had the misfor* 
tune to find that I was gone : he told me he could 
not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, 
when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, 
and to my satisfaction ; and that he had oftentimes 
a strong persuasion, that one time or other he should 
see me again : but nothing that ever befel him in 



flit TH£ LIFE AND ADVElTTURES 

his life, be said, was so surprising and afflicting to 
him at first, as the disappointment he was under 
when he came back to the island, and found I was 
not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them] 
that were left behind, and of vi*hom he said he had 
a long story to. tell me ; the Spaniards all thought 
themselves much better among the savages, only 
that their number was so smaH. *• And,** says he, 
** had they been strong enough, we had been all 
long ago in purgatory ;" and with that he crossed 
himself upon the breast. '* But, Sir,** says he, ** I 
hope you will not b« displeased when I shall tell 
you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for 
our own preservation, to disarm them, and making 
them our subjects, who would not be content with 
being moderately our masters, but would be our 
imirderei*s." I answered, I was heartily afraid of 
it when I left them there ; and nothing troubled 
me at my parting from the island, but that they 
ii-ere not come back, that I might have put them in 
possession of every thing first, and left the other in 
a state of subjection, as they deserved : but if they 
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and 
should be very far from finding any fault with it ; 
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungo* 
vemable villaiaS; and were fit for any i^anner of 
paischief.

in the dress they were in^ it was impossible to guess 

what nation they were of; but he made all clear 

both to them and to me. First he turned to me^ 

and pointing to them, said, " These, Sir, are some 

of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;'' and 

then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let 

them know who I was ; upon which they all came 

up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and 

ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if 

they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a 

monarch or a great conqueror: their behaviour 

tvas to the last degree obliging and courteous, and 

yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which 

very well became them : and in short they had 99 

much more manners than J, that I scarce knew 

how to receive their civilities, much less how tor 

return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in 
the island after my going away, is so remarkable; 
and has so many incidents, which the former part 
of my relation will help to understand, and which 
will, in most of the particulars, refer to that account 
I have already given, that I cannot but commit 
them with great delight to the reading of those, 
that come after me^ 




854 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



I skall DO longef troable the story with a relalioaL 
in ibe first pecscm; which will put me to the es* 
pense of ten thoosand Said 1% and Said he'^y and 
He told me's, and I told him's, and the like; but 
I shall collect the &ct8 historically as near as I cait 
gather them out of my memory from what they 
related to me, and from what I met with in my 
conversing with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this snccinctly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I must go back to the circumstance ior 
which I left the island, and which the persons 
were in of whom I am to speak. At first it is ne- 
cessary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's 
father and the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had 
rescued from the savages; I say, I had sent them 
away in a large canoe to the main, as I then 
thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions 
whom he had left behind him, in ordei^ to save 
them from the like calamity that he had been in,- 
and in order to succour them for the present, and 
that if possible, we might together find some way 
for our deliverance afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appear- 
ance oi^ or the least room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years be- 
fore; much less had I any foreknowledge of what 
after happened, I mean of an English ship comin jj 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8»k 

OB diore there to fetch them off; and it could not 
but be a very great sarprise to them when they 
came back, not only to find that I was gi.ne, ,but 
to find three strangers left on the spot, possessed 
of an that I had left behind me, which wonld other- 
wise have been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, 
thflk I might begin where I left o^ was of their 
OWB part; and I desired he would give me a par- 
ticular account of his voyage back to his country- 
men with the boat, when I seat him to fetoh them 
over. He told me there was little variety in that 
part; for nothing remarkable happened to them 
on the way, they having very calm weather and a 
smooth sea; for his countrymen it could not be 
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to 
see him (it seems he was the principal man among 
them, the captain of the vessel they had been ship* 
wrecked in having been dead some time :} they 
wer^ he said, the more surprised to see him, be- 
cause they knew that he was fallen into the hands 
of savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour 
him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners; 
that when he told them the story of the deliver- 
ance, and in what manner he was furnished for 
carrying them away, it was like a dream to them ; 
and their astonishment, they said, was something 
like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them 
who he was, and told them the story of his exalta- 



t56 THE LIFE AND ADTENTURES 

lion in Pharaoh's court; but when he shewedL 
them the arm^, the powder, the ball, and the pro* 
▼isions that he brought them for their journey or 
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a 
just share of the joy of their delive'rance, and im- 
mediately prepared to come away with him. 

The first business was to get canoes; and in 
this they were obliged not to stick so much upon 
the honest part of it, but to trespass upon their 
friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes 
or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing^ 
or for pleasure. 

In these they came away the next morning; ft 
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi-^ 
^ions, or any other thing in the world, but what 
they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of n'hich 
they used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offer* 
ed for my escape, as I mentioned in my other 
part, and to get off from the island ; leading three 
of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, dis- 
agreeable villains behind me that any man could 
desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards' great 
grief and disappointment you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did, was, that 
when the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my 
letter to them, and gave them provisions and other 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S57 

relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they 
gave them the long paper of directions, which I 
had left with them, containing the particular me* 
thods which I took for managing every part of my 
life there; the way how I baked my bread, bred 
up my tame goats, and planted my com ; how I 
cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word^ 
every thing I did ; all this being written down, 
they gave to the Spaniards, two of whom under- 
stood English well enough; nor did they refuse 
to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing else, 
for they agreed very well for some time : they gave 
them an equal admission into the house, or cave, 
and they began to live very sociably ; and the head 
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my me« 
thod, and Friday's father together, managed all 
their affairs ; for as for the Englishmen, th^y did 
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, 
and (batch tortoises, and when they came home at 
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for 
them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with 
this, would the other but have left them alone; 
which, however, they could not find in their hearts 
to do long ; but, like the dog in the manger, they 
would not eat themselves, and would not let others 
eat neither : the dii&rences, nevertheless, were at 
first but trivial, and such as are not worth relatbg;

AM THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

but at ladt it broke out into open war, and it began 
with all the rudeness and insolence that can be 
iniaginbdy without reason, without provocation^ 
contrary to nature* and indeed to commoQ sense; 
aad though, it is true, the first relation of it came 
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the 
accusers, yet when I came to exaniiue the fellows, 
they coujd not deny a word of it 

But before I come to the particulars of this pajt» 
I must supply a defect in my former relation ; and 
this was, that I forgot to set down among the res^ 
that just as we were weighing the anchor to set 
sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our 
ship, which I was afraid once would turn to a se- 
cond mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, 
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his as- 
sistanee« parted them by force, and making two of 
the most refractory fellows pri^soners, he laid them 
in irons; and as they bad been active in the for- 
mer disorder^ and let fall some ugly dangerous 
words the second time, he threatened to carry them 
in irons to England, and have them hanged there 
for mutiny, and running away with the ship. 

Tbis» it seems, though the captain did not intend 
to do ity frighted some other men in the ship ; and 
some of them had put it in the heads of the rest« 
that the captain only gave them good words for 
the present till they should come to some English 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. Sd9 

port, and that then they should be all put into a 
gaol, and tried for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it ; upon which it was desired that I, who 
still passed for a great man among thero> should go 
down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell 
them, that they might be assured, if they behaved 
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for 
the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and 
after passing my honour's word to them, they ap* 
peared easy, and the more so, when I caused the 
two men who were in irons to be released and for**, 
given. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for 
that night, the wind also falling calm. Next morn- 
ing we found that our two men, who had been laid 
in irons, had stole each of them a musket and some 
other weapons ; what powder or shot they had we 
knew not ; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which 
was not yet hauled up, and run away with her to 
their companions in roguery on shore. 

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long- 
boat on shore, with twelve men and the mate, aud 
away they went to seek the rogues; but they could 
neither find them, nor any of the rest ; for they 
all fled into the woods when they saw the boa^ 
coming on shore. The mate was once resolved, in 
justice to their roguery^ to have destroyed their 



S^ THE LIFE AND AmTENTUKES 

plantations, burnt all their household stuff and fur* 
niture, and left them to shift without it ; but having 
no order, he let all alone, left every thing as they 
found ity and bringing the pinnace away, came on 
board without them. 

These two men made their number fire : but the 
other three villains were so much wickeder than 
these, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 
doors to shift for themselves, and would have no- 
thing to do with them ; nor could they, for a good 
while, be persuaded to give them any food : as for 
the Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the bu- 
siness began' to go forward; the Spaniards would 
have persuaded the three English brutes to have 
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they 
said, they might be all one family ; but they would 
not hear of it : so the two poor fellows lived by 
themselves, and finding nothing but industry and 
application would make them live comfortable, 
they pitched their tents on the north shore of the 
island, bat a little more to the west, to be out of 
the danger of the savages, who always landed on 
the east parts of the island. 

Here ihey built two huts, one to lodge in, and 
the other to lay up their magazines and stores in ; 
and the Spaniards having given them some corn 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S61 

for 8ee\], and ^specially some of the pease which t 
had left them, they dug and planted^ and inclosed, 
after the pattern I had set for them all, and began 
to live pretty well : their first cro{^ of com was on 
the ground, and though it was but a little bit of 
land which they had dug up at fitst, having had 
but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, 
and find them with bread or other eatables; and 
one of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the 
ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings, 
and such other preparations, as the rice and the 
milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished 
him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving posture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own coun« 
trymen too, in mere humour, apd to insult them, 
came and bullied them, and told them the island 
was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had 
given them possession ^f it, and nobody else had 
any right to it ; and, damn them, they should build 
no houses upon their ground, unless they would 
pay them rent for them. 

The two men thought th^y had jested at first, 
and asked them to come and sit down, and see 
what fine houses they were that they had built, 
and tell them what rent they demanded : and one 
of them merrily told them, if they were ground- 
landlords, he hoped if they built tenements upoi|

the land, and made improyenaenti), they woald, ac* 
cording to the custom of all landlords, grant them 
a l(»]g lease ; and bid them go fetch a scrivener to 
draw the writings. One of the three, damning and 
^gii^gi told them they should see they were not in 
jest ; and going to a little place at a distance, where 
the honest men had made a fire to dress their 
victuals, he takes a firebrand and claps it to the 
' outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire ; 
and it would have been all burnt down ia a few 
minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fel- 
low, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his 
feet, and tbat not without some difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest 
man's thrusting him away, that he turned upon 
him with a pole he had in his hand ; and had not 
the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run 
into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His 
comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran 
in after him, and immediately they came both out 
with their muskets; and the man that was first 
struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down 
who began the quarrel, with the stock of his mus- 
ket, and that before the other two could come to 
help him ; and then seeing the rest come at them, 
they stood together, and presenting the other ends 
of their pieces to them, bade them stand off. 
The others had fire-arms with them too ; but one^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9^ 

of the 'two honest men, bolder than bis comrade, 
and ma^ desperate by bis danger, told them if 
they oflfered to move hand or f>ot they were all 
dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay 
down their arms. They did not indeed lay down 
their arms; but seeing him resolute, it brought 
them to a parley, and they consented to take their 
womided man with them, and be gone ; and, in- 
deed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently 
with the blow : however, they were much in the 
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did 
not disarm them effectually, as they might have 
done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, 
and given them an account how the rogues had 
treated them ; for the three villains studied nothing 
but revenge, and every day gave them some inti- 
mation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of 
the lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading 
down their corn, shooting three young kids and a 
she-goat, which the poor men had got to breed np 
tame for their store ; and in a word, plaguing them 
night and day in this manner, it forced the two 
men to such a desperation, that they resolved to 
fight them all three the first time they had a fair 
opportunity. In order to this they resolved to <yo 
to the castle, as they called it, that was my old 
dwelling, where the three rog^es and the Spaniards 



fM4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

all lived together at that time^ intending to hare a 
iair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to 
see fair play. So they got up in the morning be- 
fore day, and came to the place, and called the 
Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that 
answered, that they wanted to speak with them.

It happened that the day before two of the Spa- 
niards, having been in the woods, had seen one of 
the two EngHshmen, whom, for distinction, I call 
the honest men; and he had made a sad complaint to 
the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they had met 
with from their three countrymen, and how they 
had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their 
com, that they had laboured so hard to bring for- 
ward, and killed the milch-goat, and their three 
kids, which was all they had provided for their sus- 
tenance ; and that if he and his friends, meaning 
the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they 



*!• THE LIFE AND ADTENTVaES 

should be starved. When the Spaniarfs came 
borne at night, and they were all at supper, he took 
the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, 
though in genUe and mannerly terms, and asked 
them, how they could be so cruel, they being hano- 
less motfensivc fellows, and that they were putting 
themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, 
and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to 
bring things to such perfection as they had ? 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly 
•What bad they to do there? That they canie 
on shore without leave, and that they should not 
plant or build upon the island; it was none of their 

ground."-." Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly 
" Sejgmor Inglese, they must not starve." The 
Englishman replied, like a true roogh-hewn tar- 
paulin, « they might starve and be damned, they 
should not plant nor build in that place."-" B«rt 
what mast they do then. Seignior i" gays the Spa. 
mard. Another of the brutes returued, « Do ! 
d— n them, they should be servants, and work for 
them." « But how can you expect that of them ? 
they are not bought with your money ; you have 
no right to make them servants." The English- 
man answered, « The island was theirs, the gover- 
nor bad given it to them, and no man had any thine 
to do there but themselves ;" and with that swore 
by his Maker, that he would go and burn all their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S« 

sew faats ; they should build none upon their land. 

'* Why, SeigQor/' says the Spaniard, *' by the 
same rule, we must be your servants too." " Ay," 
says the bold dog, *' and so you shall too, before 
we have done with you;" mixing two or three 
O— -d d— -mme's in the proper intervals of his 
speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and 
made him no answer. However, this little dis- 
course had heated them ; and starting up, one says 
to the other, I think it was he they called Will 
Atkins, '' Come, Jack, let us go and have the other 
brush with them ; we will demolish their castle, I 
will warrant you ; they shall plant no colony in 
our dominions.^ 

Upon this they were all trooping away, with 
every man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and mut- 
tered spme insolent things among themselves, of 
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op* 
portunityofiered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did 
not so perfectly understand them as to know all 
the particulars ;' only that, in general, they threat- 
ened them hard for taking the two Englishmen's 
part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their 
lime that evening, the Spaniards said they did not 
know ; but it seems they wandered about the coun- 
try part of the night ; and then lying down in the 
fhce which I used to call my bower, they were 



SR8 TUB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Bleary, and ovenlept themselves. The case wai 
thU : they had resolved to stay till midaight, and 
so to take the poor men when they were asleep ; 
and they acknowledged it afterwards, intending to 
set fire to their hats while they were hi them» and 
either barn them in them, or murder them as they 
came out : and, as malice seldom sleeps very sound, 
it was very strange they abould not have been 
kept waking. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon 
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one 
than that of burning and murdering, it happened, 
and very luckily Tor them all, that they were up 
and gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues 
came to their huts. 

When they came thither, and found the men 
gone, Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest man, 
called out to his comrades, " Ha ! Jack, here's the 
nest; but d^?n them, the birds are flown.'' They 
mused awhile to think what should be the ocoaston 
of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested 
presently, that the Spaniards had given them notice ' 
of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore 
to one another, that they would be revenged of the 
Spaniards* As soon as they had made this bloody 
bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's ha* 
bitation ; they did not set fire indeed to any thing, 
but they puUed down both their houses, and pulled 



Of ROBINSON CRUSOE. S69 

them so limb from llmb^ that they left not the least 
stick standings or scarce any sign on the ground 
where they stood ; they tore all their little collect- 
ed hoasehold-stofFin pieces, and threw every thing 
about in such a manner, that the poor men found, 
afterwards, some of their things a mile off from 
their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the 
young trees which the poor men had planted; 
pulled up the enclosure they had made to secure 
their cattle and their com ; and, in a word, sacked 
and plundered every thing, as completely as a herd 
of Tartars would have done. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find 
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever 
they had been, though they were but two to three : 
so that, had they met, there certainly would have 
been bloodshed among them ; for they were all 
very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them 
asunder, than they themselves could do to meet : 
for, as they had dogged one another, when the 
three were gone thither/ the two were here; and 
aflerwards, when the two went back to find them, 
the three were come to the old habitation again : 
we shall see their differing conduct presently. 
When the three came back, like furious creatures, 
flushed wkh the rage whkli the work they had 



ittO THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

been aboat put them into, they came up to the 
Spaniardfi, and told them what they had done, by 
way of scoff and bravado; and one of them step* 
ping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been 
a couple of boya at play, takes hold of his hat, a« 
it was upon his head, and giving it a twiii about* 
fleering in his face, says he to him, '* And yoo» 
Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, 
if you do not mend your manners.'* The Spa-* 
niard, who though quite a civil man, was as brave 
as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong 
well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good 
while ; and then, having no weapon in his hand, 
stepped gravely up to him, and with one blow of 
his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled with 
a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, insolent as 
the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard imme* 
diately : he missed his body indeed, for the ballets 
went through his hair, but one of them touched the 
tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The 
blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt 
than he really was, and that put him into some 
heat, for befora he acted all in a perfect calm ; but 
now resolving to go through with his work, he 
stooped and took the fellow's musket whom he 
had knocked down> and was just going to shoot the 
man who had fired at him ; when the rest of the 
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and caliiug 



OF ROBINSON CEUSOE. 871 

to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secufed the 
olher two, and took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as wM 
as their own countrymen, they began to, cool; and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their arms again ; but the Spaniards, consideriag 
the feud that was between them and the other two 
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method 
they could take to keep them from one another, 
told them they would do them no^ harm ; and if 
they would live peaceably they would be very wil* 
ling to assist and associate with them, as they did 
before ; but that they could not think of giving them 
their arms again, while they appeared so resolved 
to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, 
and had even threatened them all to make them 
their servants. 

The r^ucs were now more capable to hear rea- 
son than to act reason; but being refused their 
arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad^ 
men, threatening what they. would do, though they 
liad up fire*arDis : but the Spaniards, despising their 
threatening, told them they should take care how 
they oSered any injury to their plantation or cattle ; 
for if they did, they wouhl riioot them, as they 
would do ravenous beasts^ wherever they found 
ibem; and if they fell into their hands alivdi they 



CrS THE UFE AHD ADV^EHTURES 

would certainly be hanged. Howerer, this was far 
Irom cooling them ; hot away they went, swearing 
and rag^g like fbries of helL As soon as they 
were gone, came back the two men in passion and 
rage enough also, thoogh of another kind; for, 
having been at their plantation, and finding it all 
demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily 
be supposed they had provocation enough; they 
could scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spa- 
niards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was 
strange enough to find, that three men should thus 
bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at alL 

The Spaniards indeed despised them, and espe- 
cially having thus disarmed them, made light of 
their threatenings; but the two Englishmen re* 
solved to have their remedy against them, what 
pains soever it cost to find them out . 

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told 
them, that they were already disarmed : they could 
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them 
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them : " But,'' said 
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, " we 
will- endeavour to make them do you justice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for, as there is no doubt but they 
will come to us again when their passion is over, 
being not able to subsist without our assistance, we 
promise you to make no peace with them, without 
having a fiiU satisfaction for you ; and upon this 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, S73 

conditioa we hope you will promise to use no' vio- 
lence with them; othe^ than in your defence/' . 

The two Englishmen yielded to this' very awk- 
wardly« and with great reluctance ; but the Spa- 
niards protested, they did it only to keep them 
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last; 
" For/' said they, " we are not so many of us; 
here is room enough for us all, and it is great pity 
we should not be all good friends.'' At length 
they did consent, and waited for the iasue of.tfae 
thing, living for some days with the Spaniards; 
for their own habitation v^as destroyed.. . 

In about five days time the three. vagrants, tired 
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the side of the creek ; 
they came up in a very submissive humble manner, 
and begged to be received again into the family. 
The Spaniai*ds used them civillyi but told.them> 
they had acted so unnaturally by their country- 
men, and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), 
that they could not come to any conclusion with- 
out consulting the two Englishmen, and. the rest; 
but however they would go to them, and discourse

it; for it seems, as they wfere to wait this balf-hoar 
for an answer, tkey begged he would send them 
oat some bread in the mean time ; which he did, 
and sent them at the same time a lai^ piece of 
goat's flesh, and a broiled parroty which Uiey ate 
very heartily, for they were hungry enough. 

After half an hour's consultation they were called 
in, and a long debate had about them, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all 
their labour, and a design to murder them; all 
which they owned before, and therefore could not 
deny now ; upcm the whole, the Spaniards acted 
the moderators between them; and as they had 
obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three, 
while they were naked and unarmed, so they now 
obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows' 
two huts^ one to be of the same dimensions, and the 
other larger than they were before ; also to fence 
their ground again, where they had polled up the 
fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, 
dig up the land again for planting corn, where they 
had ^iled it; and, in a word, to restore every 
thing in the same state as they found it* as near as 
they could ; for entirely it could not be, the season 
for the com, and the growth of the trees and 
hedges, not being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they all submitted to this : and as they 

Imd plenty of provisions given them all the while,

;tfaey grew very orderiy, and the whole society be- 
•gan to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; 
only that these three fellows could ne^er be per- 
suaded to woric ; I mean, not for themselves, ex- 
•cept now and then a little, just as they pleased; 
however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if 
they would but live sociably and friendly together, 
and study in the whole the good of the plantaticm, 
they would be content to work for them, and let 
them walk about and be as idle as they pleased; 
and thus having lived pretty well together for a 
month or two, the Spaniards gave them their arms 
again, ' and gave them liberty to go abroad mth 
them as before. 

It was not above a week altor they had these 
arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful •crea- 
tures began to be as insolent and troublesome as 
before; but however, an accident happened pre- 
sently upon thii^ which endangered the safety of 
them all; they were obliged to lay by all private 
resentments, and look to the preservation of their 
lives. 

It happened one night, that the Spaniard gover- 
nor, as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose 
life I had saved, who was now the captain, or lead- 
er, or governor of the rest, found himself very un- 
easy in the night, and could by no means get any 
sleep : he was perfectly well in body, as he told 



276 THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ine the stoiy, only found his thoughts tumultuous; 
his mind ran upon men fighting, and killing one an- 
other> but was broad awake, and could not by any 
means get any sleep; in short, he lay a great 
while; but growing more and more uneasy, he re- 
solved to rise : as they lay, being so many of them, 
upon goats-skins, laid thick upon such couches and 
pads as they made for themselves, and not in ham- 
mocks and ship-beds, as I did, who was but one^ so 
they had little to do, when they 'were willing to 
rise, but to get up upon their feet, and perhaps put 
on a coati such as it was, and their pumps, and they 
were ready for going any way that theif thoughts 
guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being 
dark, he could see little or nothing ; and besides, 
the trees which I had planted> as in my foimer ac- 
count is described^ and which were now grown tall, 
intercepted his sights so that he could only look up, 
and see that it was a clear star-light night; and, 
hearing no noise, he returned and laid him down 
again ; but it was all one> he could not sleep, nor 
could he compose himself to any thing like rest, but 
his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy^ and yet 
he knew not for what 

Having made some noise with rising and walking 
about, going oat and coming in, another of them 
waked^ and, calling, asked who it was that was up ? 



OF UOBIKSON CRUSOE. 217 

The governor told him how it had been with him. 
" Say you so ?" says the other Spaniard ; ^ such 
things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is 
certainly some mischief working/' says he, " near 
us /' and presently he asked him, * " Where are 
the Englishmen ?"— *' They are all in their huts/' 
says he, ^' safe enough/' It seems, the Spaniards 
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had 
made a place, where the three Englishmen, since 
their last mutiny, always quartered by themselves, 
and could not come at the rest. " Well," says the 
Spaniard, '' there is something in it, I am persuad- 
ed from my own experience ; I am satisfied our 
spirits embodied have converse with, and receive 
intelligence from, the spirits unembodied, and in- 
habiting the invisible world ; and this friendly no- 
tice is given for our advantage, if we know how to 
make use of it Come," says he, '* let us go out 
and look abroad ; and if we find nothing at all in 
it to justify our trouble, I'll tell you a story to the 
purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my 
proposing it/' 

In a word, they went out to go to the top of the 
hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong, 
and in good company, nor alone, as I was, used 
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and 
then pulling it up after them, to go up a second 
stage to the top, but were going round through the

grove unconcerned and unwaiy^ when they were 
surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little 
way off from them, and hearing the Toices of men» 
not of one, or two, but of a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages 
landing on the bland, it was my constant care to 
prevent them making the least discovery of there 
being any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any necessity they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectually, that they that got away, were scarce 
able to give any account of it, for we disappeared 
as soon as possible, nor did ever any that had seen 
me, escape to tell any one else> except it were the 
three savages in our l^st encounter, who jumped 
into, the boat, of whom I mentioned that I was 
afraid they should go home, and bring more help. 

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of 
Uiose men, that so great a number came now to^ 
getber; or whethiMr they came ignorantly, and by 
accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spa* 
niards could not, it seems, understand : but whatever 
it was, it had been their business, either to have 
concealed themselves, and not have seen them at 
all ; n^uch less to have let the savages have seen, 
that there were any inhabitants in the place ; but 
to have fallen upon them so ^^tually^ as that not 
a man of them should have escaped, which could 
oi^ly have been by getting in between them anif 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB* 870 

their boats : but this presence of mind was wanting 
to them ; which was the ruin of their tranquillity 
for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor, and 
the man with him, surprised with this sight, ran 
back immediately, and raised their felWws, giving 
them an account of the imminent danger they were 
all in; and they again as readily took the alarm; 
but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close 
within where they were, but that they must all run 
out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for some hoursi, 
to view them by the light of three fires they had 
made at some distance from one another; what they 
were doing they knew not, and what to do therab- 
selves they knew not; for, first;, the enemy were 
too many; and, secondly, they did not keep to^ 
gether, but were divided into several parties, and 
were on shore in several places. 

The Spanisgrds were in no small consternation at 
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran 
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt, 
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place, where 
they would see the tokens of inhabitants ; and they 
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock 
of goats, which would have been little less than

starving them, if they should have been destroyed; 
80 the first thing they resolved upon, was to dis- 
patch three men away before it was light, viz. two 
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the 
goats away to the great valley where the cave was, 
and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave 
itself. 

Could they have seen the savages all together in 
one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they 
resolved, if there had been an hundred of them, to 
have attacked them; but that could not be obtained, 
for there were some of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course 
they should take, and beaten their brains in consi- 
dering their present circumstances, they resolved at 
last, while it was dark, to send the old savage (Fri- 
day's father) out as a spy, to learn if possible some- 
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and 
what they intended to do, and the like. The old 
man readily undertoc^ it, and stripping himself 
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he 
went. Ai^er he had been gone an hour or two, he 
brings word that he had been among them undis- 
covered, that he found they were two parties, and 
of two several nations, who had war with one an- 
other, and had had a great battle in their own 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 881 

^M>i]ntry« and that both sides having had seversA 
prisoners taken in the fight, they were by mere 
chance landed in the same island for the deronr- 
ing their prisoners^ and making merry ; but their 
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled 
all their mirth; that they were in a great rage at 
one another, and were so near, that he believed 
they would fight again as soon as daylight began to 
appear; but he did not perceive that they had any 
notion of any body's being on the island but them- 
selves. He had hardly made an end of telling the 
story, when they could perceive, by the unui^ual 
noise they made, that the two little armies were en- 
gaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could 
to persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen: 
he told them their safety consisted in it, and that 
they had nothing to do but to lie still, and the sa- 
vages would kill one another to their hands, and 
the rest would go away ; and it was so to a tiltf e. 
Bat it was impossible to prevail, especially upon 
the Englishmen, their curiosity was so importunate 
upon their prudentials, that they must run out and 
see the battle ; however, they used some caution, 
viz. they did not go openly just by their own dwel- 
ling, but went farther into the woods, and placed 
themselves to advantage, where they might secure- 
)y see them manage the fight, and, as they thqughly 



tai THE LIFE AND ADYENTURBS 

nol to be seen by them ; but it teeisis the savages 
dad see them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was yery fierce, and if I might be- 
lieve the Englishmen, one of them said he could 
perceive that some of them were men of great 
bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy 
ia guiding the fight The battle, they said, held 
two hoars before they could guess which party 
would be beaten ; but then that party which was 
nearest our people's habitation began to appear 
weakest, and, after some time more, some of them 
began to fly ; and this pot our men again into a 
great consternation, lest any of those that fled 
should run into the grove before their dweMing for 
shelter, and tliereby involuntarily discover the place, 
and that by consequence the pursuers should do Ifte 
like in search for them. Upon this they lesolved, 
that they wouki stand armed within the wall, and 
whoever came into the grove they shoukl sally out 
over the wall, and kill them, so that if possible not 
one should return to give an account of it ; ^y 
ordered also, that it should be done with their swords, 
or by knocking them down with the stock of the 
muskeg not by shooting them, for fear of raising 
an alann by the noise. 

As they expected it fell out : three of the routed 
army fled fi>r life, and crossing the creek ran di- 
rectly into the place, not in the least knowing whi* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 263 

ther they went^ bat numing as into a thick wood 
for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad 
gave notice of this withinj with thb addition to our 
meil's great satisfaction, viz. that the conquerors- 
had not pursued them, or seen which way they 
were gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a 
man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the 
three fugitiyes ; but sending three men out by the 
top of the hill, ordered them to go round and come 
in behind them, surprise and take them prisoners ; 
which was done: the residue of the conquered 
people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the 
victors retired, and made no pursuit, or very little, 
but drawing themselves into a body together, gave 
two great screaming shouts, which they supposed 
were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; 
and the same day, about three o'clock in the after- 
noon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus 
the Spaniards had their island again free to them^ 
Selves, their fright was over, and they saw no sava- 
ges in several years after. 

After tiiey were all gone, the Spaniards came 
out of their den, and viewing the field of battle, they 
fi>ond s^>out two-and-thirty dead men upon the 
qK>t; some were killed with great long arrows, se- 
veral of which were found sticking in their bodies, 
but most of them were killed with their great wooden 
•words, sixteen or seventeen of which they found 



284 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in the field of battle^ and as many bows« with a 
great many arrows. These swords were great un- 
wieldy things, and they must be very strong men 
that used them ; most of those men that were kil- 
led with them had their heads, mashed to pieces, 
as we may say, or, as we call it in English, their 
brains knocked out, and several of their arms and 
legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with 
inexpressible rage and fury. They found not one 
wounded pan that was not stone dead ; for either 
they stay by their enemy till they have quite kil- 
led them, or they carry all the wounded men, that 
are not quite dead, away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a 
great while; the sight had filled them with horror,, 
and the consequence appeared terrible to the last 
degree, especially upon supposing that some time, 
or other they should fall into the hands of those 
creatures, who would not only kill them as ene- 
mies, but kill them for food as we kill our cattle. 
And they professed to me, that the thoughts of 
being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was 
supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had 
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their 
very stomachs, made them sick when they thought 
of it, and filled their minds with unusual terror, 
that they were not themselves for some weeks, 
after. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.' ^285 

This, as I said, tamed even the three English 
brutes I have been speaking of, and for a great 
while after they were very tractable, and went aboat 
the common business of the whole society well 
enough ; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be 
all naturalized to the country; but some time after 
this they fell all into such* simple measures again as 
brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had ob- 
served; and these three being lusty stout young 
fellows, they made them servants, and taught them 
to work for them ; and as slaves they did well 
enough ; but they did not take their measures with 
them as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin 
with them upon the principle of having saved their 
lives, and then instructed them in the rational 
principles of life, much less of religion, civilizing 
and reducing thedd by kind usage and affectionate 
arguings ; but as they gave them their food every 
day, so they gave them their work too, and kept 
them fully employed in drudgery enough; but they 
failed in thb by it, that they never had them to 
assist them and fight for them as I had my man 
Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh 
upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part : Being- all now 
good friends (for common danger, as I said above, 
had effectually reconciled them,) they began to' 



j2d6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

•consider their general circumstances ; and the first 
thing that came under their consideration was, 
whether^ seeing the savages particularly haunted 
that side of the island, and that there were more 
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to 
their way of living, and manifestly to their advan- 
tage> they should not rather remove their habitar 
Uon> and plant in some more proper place for their 
safety, and especially for the security of their cattle 
and com. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived 
that they should not remove their habitation, be> 
cause that some time or other they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, meaning 
me ; and if I should send any one to seek them, I 
would be sure to direct them on that side, where if 
they should find the place demolished they would 
conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and so our supply would go away too. 

But as to their com and cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as proper to both, and where 
indeed there was land enough ; however, upon se- 
^nd thoughts they altered one part of that resolu- 
tion too, and resolved only to remove part of their 
cattle thither, and plant part of their com there ; 
and so^ if one part was destroyed, the other might 
be sayied; and one piece of prudence they usedt 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. fST 

wbich it was very well they did; viz. that they 
Bever trasted these three savages^ which they had 
taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of the 
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any 
cattle they had there; much less of the cave there, 
which they kept in case of necessity as a safe re- 
treat; and thither they carried also the twobar- 
reb of powder which I had left them at my co- 
ming away. 

Bat however they resolved not to change theif 
habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefuL* 
ly covered it first with a wall and fortification, and^ 
then with a grove of trees ; so seeing their safety 
consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which 
th^ were now fully convinced, they set to work to 
cover and conceal the place yet more effectually 
than before : to this purpose, as I had planted trees 
(or rather thrust in stakes which in time all grew 
to be trees) for some good distance before the en- 
trance into my apartment, they went on in the same 
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space 
of ground, fipom the trees I had set quite down to 
the side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my 
floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide 
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, 
or any sign that there had been any landing there- 
about. These stakes also being of a wood very for- 
ward to groW/ as I had noted formerly, they took 



S88 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

care to have generally very much larger and taller 
than those which I had planted^ and placed them 
80 Tery thick and close^ that when they had been 
three or four years grown « there was no piercing 
with the eye any considerable way into the planta- 
tion. As for that part which I had planted, the 
trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh ; and 
among them they placed so many other short ones, 
and so thicks that, in a word, it stood like a palisa- 
do a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to im- 
'))ossible to penetrate it but with a little army to cut 
it all down ; for a little dog could hardly get be- 
tween the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all; for they did the same by 
all the ground to the right hand^ and to the left, 
and round even to the top of the hill, leaving no 
way, not so much as for themselves to come out^ 
but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hilli 
and then lifted up and placed again from the first 
Stage up to the top ; which ladder, when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had wings or witch-craft 
to assist it, could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it 
less than what they afterwards found occasion for; 
which served to convince me, that as human pru- 
dence has authority of Providence to justify it, so 
it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set 
it to work, and, would we listen carefully to the 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^^ 

* * 

▼oi ce of ity I am fully persuaded we might prevent 
many of the disasters which our lives are now by 
our own negligence subjected to : but this by the 
way. 

I return to the story : They lived two years after 
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits 
from the savages; they had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them in a great con- 
sternation; for some of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the west side, or rather end of 
the island, which, by the way, was th^t end where 
I never went, for fear of being discovered, they were 
surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians 
just coming on shore. 

They made the best of their way home in hurry 
enough, and giving the alarm to their comrades, 
they kept close all that day and the next, going out 
only at night to make observation ; but they had 
the good luck to be mistaken, for wherever the 
savages went, they did not land at that time on the 
island^ but pursued some other design.

in which he bore it by his side, and fell upon him, 
the poor savage, not to correct him but to kill

treating him not to murder the poor man* clapt in 
between him and the savage to prevent the mis-

The fellow being enraged tlie more at thi^ 
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore 
he would serve him as he intended to serve the 
savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided 
the blow, and with a shovel which he had in his 
hand (for they were working in the field about the 
com-land«) knocked the brute down; another of 
•the Englishmen running at the same time to help 
his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down, and then 
two Spaniards more came to help their man, and a 
third Englishman fell upon them. They had none 
of them any |fire*arms, or any other weapons but 
hatchets and other tools, except the third English- 
man; he had one of my old rusty cutlasses with 
which he made at the last Spaniard^, and wounded 
them both* This fray set the whole family in an 
uproar, and more help coming in, they took the 
three Englishmen prisoners. . The next question 
was, what should be done with them ? they had 
been so often mutinous, and were so farious, so 
desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not 
what course tp take with them, for they were mia- 



f9% THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

cbievoiis to the highest degree^ and valaed not what 
hart they did any man ; so that, in short, it was 
not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor, told them ia 
so many words, that if they had been his own 
countrymen he would have hanged them all ; for 
all laws and all goreraors were to preserve society, 
and those who were dangerous to the society ought 
to be expelled out of it ; but as they were English- 
men, and that it was to the generous kindness of 
an Englishman that they all owed their preserva- 
tion and deliverance, he would use them with all 
possible lenity, and would lieave them to the judge- 
ment of the other two Englishmen, who were their 
countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and* 
said they desired it might not be left to them; 
*' Yixi* says he, ^ I am sure we ought to sentence 
them to the gallows; and with that gives an ac- 
count how Will Atkins, one of the three, had pro- 
posed to have all the five Englishmen join together, 
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in 
their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls 
to Will Atkins 2 *' How, Seignior Atkins,'' says he, 
** will you murder us all ? What have you to say . 
to that ? That hardened villain was so far from de- 
nying ity that he said it was true, and, G-d d-mn 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 993 

him, they would do it still before they had done' 
with them. ''Well but Seignior Atkins/' said 
the Spaniard, '* what have we done to you that you 
will kill us ? And what would you get by killing us? 
And what must we do to prevent your killing ^s ? 
Must we kill you, or will you kill us ? Why will you 
put us to the necessity of this. Seignior Atkins V 
says the Spaniard, very calmly and smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spa- 
niard's making a jest of it, that had he not been 
held by three men, and withal had no weapons 
with him, it was thought he would have attempted 
to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the 
company. 

This harebrained carriage obliged them to con- 
sider seriously what was to be done. The two Eng- 
lishmcln and the Spaniard who saved the poor sa- 
vage, were of the opinion that they shodld hang 
one of the three for an example to the rest; and 
that particularly it should be he that had twice 
attempted to commit murder with Jiis < Jiatchet ; 
and indeed there was some reason to believe he 
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a mi- 
serable .condition with the wound he had received, 
that it was thought he could not live. 
' But the governor Spaniard still said, no, it was 
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and 
he would never consent to put an EngUsman to 



SM THE UPE AKD ADYENTORES 

death though he had murdered half of them : nay, 
he said if he had been killed himself by an En^ish* 
man, and had time left to apeak, it should be that 
they should pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the govec^ 
nor Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and 
as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where 
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came in- 
to it; but then it was to be considered what should 
be done to keep them from the mischief they de- 
signed ; for all agreed, governor and ail, that means 
were to be used for preserving the society from 
danger. After a long debate it was agreed, first, 
that they should be disarmed, and not permitted 
to have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or 
any weapon, and should be turned out of the so- 
ciety, and left to live where they would, and how 
they could by themselves; but that none of the 
rest, either Spsmiards or English, should converse 
with them, speak v^ith them, or have any thing to 
do with them; that they should be forbid to come 
within a certain distance of the place where the 
rest dwelt ; and that if they offered to commit any 
disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any 
of the com, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle 
belonging to the society, that they should die 
without mercy, and would shoot them wherever 
they could find them. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S95 

The governor^ a man of great humanity^ musing 
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and 
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, ^ Hold, 
you must reflect, that it will be long ere they can 
raise com and cattle of their own, and they must 
not starve : we must therefore allow them provi- 
sions/' So he caused to be added, that they should 
have a proportion of com given them to last them 
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time 
they might be supposed to raise some of their own; 
that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, 
and six kids given them, as well for present sub- 
sistence as for a store ; and that they should have 
tools given them for their work in the field; such 
as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like ; bat 
they should have none of these tools or provisions 
unless they would swear solemnly that they would 
not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, 
or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turn- 
ed them out to shift for themselves. They went 
away sullen and refractory, as neither contented to 
go away or to stay; but as there was no remedy 
they went, pretending to go and choose a place 
where they should settle themselves, to plant and 
live by themselves; and some provisions were 
given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days afler they came again 



906 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for some victuals, and gave the governor an Ac- 
count where they had pitched their tents, and 
marked themselves oat an habitation or plantation : 
it was a very convenient place indeed, on the 
remotest part of the island, N. £. much about the 
place where I providentially landed in my first 
▼oyage when I was driven out to sea, the Lord . 
alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to sur* 
round the island. , 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, 
and contrived them in a manner like my first ha- 
bitation, being close under the side of a bill, ha- 
ying some trees growing already to the three sides 
of it ; so that by planting others it would be very 
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly 
searched for. They desired some dry goat-skins 
for beds and covering, which were given them; 
and upon their giving their words that they would 
not disturb the rest, . pr injure any of their planta- 
tions, they gave them hatchets, and what other 
tools they could spare ; some pease, barley, and rice, 
for sowing, and, in a word, any thing they want- 
ed but arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition abont six 
months, and had got in their first harvest, though 
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they 
had planted being but little ; for indeed having all 
their plantation to fofin, they had a great de^ of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1297 

work upoQ their hands; and when they came to 
make boards^ and pots, and such things, they were 
quite out of their element, and could make nothing 
of it; and when the rainy season came on, for want 
of a ca^e in the earth, they could not keep their 
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling: 
and this humbled them much ; so they came and 
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they 
very readily did ; and in four days worked a great 
hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough 
to secure their com and other things from the rain; 
but it was but a poor place at best compared to 
mine; and especially as mine was then; for the 
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made se- 
veral new apartments in it. 
.. About three quarters of a year after this sepa« 
ration, a new frolic took these rogues, which, to- 
gether with the former villainy they had commit- 
ted, brought mischief enough upon them, and had 
very near been the ruin of the whole colony. The 
three new associates began, it seems, to be weary 
of the laborious life they led, and that without hope 
of bettering their circumstances; and a whim took 
them, that they would make a voyage to the conti- 
nent from whence the savages came, and would try 
if they could not fseize upon some prisoners among 
tt|e natives there, and bring them home, so as to 



998 TUB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

make them do the lahorious part of the work for 
them. 

The prefect was not so preposterous if they had 
gone no farther; but they did nothing and pro- 
posed nothing but had either mischief in the de- 
sign, or mischief in the event; ,and if I may give 
my opinion^ they seemed to be under a blast from 
Heaven ; for if we will not allow a visible curse to 
pursue visible crimes^ how shall we reconcile the 
events of things with divine justice ? It was cer- 
tainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of 
mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state 
they were in ; and as they shewed not the least 
remorse for the crime^ but added new villanies to 
it^ such as particularly that piece of monstrous 
cruelty of wounding a poor slave because he did 
not^ or perhaps could not understand to do what he 
was directed, and to wound him in such a manner 
as, no question, made him a cripple all his life, and 
in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be 
had for his cure; and what was still worse, the 
murderous intent, or, to do justice to the crime> 
the intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, 
as was afterwards the formed design they all laid to 
murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the story : 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 199 

morning* and in very humble terms desired to be 
admitted to speak with them : the Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had to say, which was this« 
that they were tired of living in the manner they 
did, that they were not handy enough to*make the 
necessaries they wanted, and that having no help, 
they found they should be starved ; but if the Spa* 
niards would give them leave to take one of the 
canoes which they came over in, and give them 
arms and ammunition proportioned for their de» 
fence, they would go over to the main, and seek 
their fortune, and so deliver them from the trou« 
ble of supplying them with any other provisions. . 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them; but yet very honestly represented to them 
the certain destruction they were running into; 
told them they had suffered such hardships upon 
that very spot, that they could, without any spirit 
of prophecy, tell them, that they would be starved 
or murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be 
starved if they stayed here, for they could not 
work, and would not work : and they could but be 
starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, there 
was an end of them, they had no wives or chiU 
dren to cry after them, and, in short, insisted im- 
portunately upon their demand, declaring that they 



300 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

wottM go, whether they would give them any arms 
or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, 
that if they were resolved to go, they should not 
go like naked men, and be in no condition to de- 
fend themselves, and that though they could ill 
spare their fire-arms, having not enough for them- 
selves> yet they would let them have two muskets, 
8 pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, 
which they thought sufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the oflfer; and having 
baked them bread enough to serve them a month, 
and given them as much goat's flesh as they could 
eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full of 
dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young 
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for 
a voyage over the sea, where it wa$ at least forty 
miles broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would 
have very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and 
therefore was rather too big for them to manage ; 
but as they had a fair breezie and the flood-tide 
with them, they did well enough ; they had made 
a.masl of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat- 
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced to- 
gether; and away they went merrily enough ; the 
Spaniards palled after them, *^ Bon veajo ;" and no 
man ever thought of seeing them any more. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. SOI 

The Spaniards would often say to one another, 
and the two honest Eriglishmen who remained be- 
hind, how quietly and comfortably they lived now 
those three turbulent fellows were gone; as iot 
their ever coming again, that was the remotest 
thing from their thoughts, could be imagined ; 
when, behold, after twenty-two days absence, one 
of the Englishmen being abroad upon his planting 
work, sees three strange men coming towards him 
at a distance, two of them with guns upon their 
shoulders. 

' Away runs* the Englishman, as if he was be- 
witched, and came frighted and amazed, to the 
governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all un- 
done, for there were strangers tanded upon the 
island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard pau- 
sing a while, says to him, ** How do you mean, you 
cannot tell who ? They are savages to be sure." 
'* No, no>" toys the Englishman, ** they are men 
in clothes, with arms.*'-*-*' Nay then,'* says the 
Spaniard, *' why are you concerned > If they are 
not savages, they must be friends; for there is no 
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good ra- 
ther than hann. 

While they were debating thus, came the three 
Englishmen, and standing without the wood which 
was new-planted, hallooed to them ; they presently 
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that 



903 THE li^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

kind ceased. Bat now the admiration was tarned 
npon another qaestion, tiz. What could be the 
mattert and what made them come back again ? 

It was not Jong before they brought the men in; 
and inquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing ? they gave them a full account 
of their voyage in a few words, viz. that they 
reached the land in two days, or something less, 
but finding the people alarmed at their coming, 
and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, 
they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the 
northward six or seven hours, till they came to a 
great opening, by which they perceived that the 
land they saw from our island was not the main, 
but an island : that entering that opening of the 
sea» they saw another island on the right hand 
north, and several more west ; and being resolved 
to land somewhere, they gut over to one of the 
islands which lay wes^ and went boldly on shore; 
that they found the people were courteous and 
friendly to them, and they gave them several root^ 
and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable : 
and the women, as well as the men, were very for- 
ward to supply them with any thing they could get^ 
for them to eat, and brought it to them a g^eat way 
upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as 
well as tfaey could of them by signs, what nations 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. SOS 

Were this way, and that way ; and were told of se- 
veral fierce and terrible people^ that lived almost 
every way ; who, as they made known by signs to 
them, used to eat men; but as for themselves, they 
said, that they never ate men or women, except 
only such as they took in the wars; and then they 
owned that they made a great feast, and ate their 
prisoners* 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast 
of that kind, and they told them two moons ago, 
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; aid 
that their great king had two hundred prisoners 
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were 
feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. 
The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see 
those prisoners; but the others mistaking them, 
thought they were desirous to have some of them 
to carry away for their own eating. So they 
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the 
sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify, 
that the next morning at sunrising they would 
bring some for them; and accordingly the next 
fiiorning tkey brought down five women and eleven 
men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry 
with them on their voyage, just as we would bring 
80 many cows and oxen down to a sea-port town to . 
victual a ship* 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were 



904 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

at home^ their ftomachs tamed at this sight, and 
they did DOt know what to do ; to refuse the pri- 
soners would have, been the highest affront to the 
savage gentry that aSmd them ; and what to do 
with them they knew not; however, upon some 
debate, they resolved to accept of them; and in 
return they gave the savages that brought them 
one of their hatchet^ an old key, a knife, and six 
or seven of their ballets, which, thoogfa they did 
not understand, they seemed extremely pleased 
with; and then tying the poor creator^ hands be- 
hind them, they (the people) dragged the prisoners 
into the boat for our men. ' 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as 
soon as they had them, or els6 they that gave them 
this noble present would certainly have expected 
that they should have gone to work with them^ 
have killed two or three of them the next moming» 
and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 

But having taken their leave with all the respect 
and thanks that could well pass between people^ 
where, on either side, they understood not one word 
they could say, they put off with their boat, and 
came back towards the first island, where when they 
arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have som^ 
oommunication with their prisoners, but it was im- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SOi 

possible to make them ukiderstand any thing ; no- 
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do for 
them> but was looked upon as going about to murder 
them : they first of all unbound them, but the poor 
creatures screamed at that, especially the women, 
as if they had just felt the knife at their throats; 
for they immediately concluded they were un- 
bound on purpose to be killed. 

If they gare them any thing to eat, it was the 
same thing; then they concluded it was for feai 
they should sink in fleshy and so not be fat enough 
to kill; if they looked at one of them more par* 
ticularly, the party presently concluded it was to 
see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill 
first ; pay, afi:er they had brought them quite 
over, and began to use them kindly, and treat them 
well, still they expected every day to make a din« 
ner or supper for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac- 
countable history or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard asked them where their new family was? 
And being told that they had brought them on 
' shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were 
come to beg some victuals for them; they (the 
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is 
to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down 
to the place and see them, and did so, and Friday's 
father with them. 

VOL. U. 17 



S06 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

When they came into the hut, there they sat aH 
bound ; for when they bad brought them on shore 
they bound their hands^ that they might not take 
the boat and make their escape ; there, I say^ they 
saty ali of them stark naked. First, there were 
three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, 
straight and fair limbs, about thirty or thirty-five 
years of age, and five wmnen ; whereof two might 
be firom thirty to forty, two more not above twen- 
ty-four or twenty*five, and the fifth, a tall comely 
maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women 
were well-favoured, agreeable persons, both in 
shape and featuresi, only tawny ; and two of them, 
had they been perfect white, would have passed 
for handsome women, even in London itself, having 
very pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of a 
very modest behaviour, especially when they came 
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they call- 
ed it, though that dress was very indifierent, it 
must be confessed ; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was .something un- 
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a 
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the 
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good hu- 
mour that ever I met with ; and, in particular, of 
the most modesty, as will presently appear : I say 
the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men 

and five naked women, all together bound, and in 

lO 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. SOT 

the most miserable circnmstanoes that hnmau na- 
ture could be supposed to he, Viz. to be expecting 
every moment to be dragged out^ and have their 
brains knocked out, and then to be eaten op like 
a calf that is killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old In- 
dian, Friday's father, to go in and see first if he 
knew any of them, and then if he understood any 
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, 
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of 
them; neither could any of them understand a 
word he said, or a sign he could make, except one 
of the women. 

However, this was enough to answer the end, 
which was to satisfy them, that the men into whose 
hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they 
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they 
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon 
as they were assured of this, they discovered such 
ajoy, and by such awkward and several ways as is 
hard to describe, for it seems they were of several 
nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, 
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing 
to be servants, and to work for the men who had 
brought them away to save their lives ? At which 
they all fell a-dancing ; and presently one fell to 
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay 



908 THE LIFE ANi) ADVENTURES 

next, to carry oa their shoalders^ to iotimate that 
they were willing to work« 

The govemor, who found that the having wo- 
men among them would presently be attended 
with some inconveniency> and might occasion 
tome strife, and perhaps blQod« asked the three 
men what they intended to do with these women, 
and how they intended to use them, whether as ser- 
yantSy or as women ? One of the Englishmen an- 
swered very boldly and readily, that they would 
use them as both. To which the governor said, 
'' I am not going to restrain you from it ; you are 
your own masters as to that: but this I think is 
but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among 
• you, and I desire it of you for that reason only, 
viz. that you will all engage, that if any of you 
take any of these women as a woman, or wife, he 
shall take but one ; and that, having taken one, 
none else should touch her ; for though we cannot 
marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that 
while you stay here, the woman any of you takes 
should be maintained by the man that takes her, 
and should be his wife ; " I mean," says he, " while 
he continues here ; and that none else should have 
any thing to do with her." All this appeared so 
just, that every one agreed to it without any diffi- 
culty. 
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 309 

1 
V 

they designed to take any of them? Bat every one 
answered^ " No :'* some of them said they had 
wives in Spain ; and the others did not like women 
that were not Christians ; and all together decla- 
red, that they would not touch one of them ; which 
was an instance of sach virtue as I have not met 
with in all my travels. On the other hand, to be 
short, the five Englishmen took them every one a 
wife ; that is to say, a temporary wife ; and so 
they set up a new form of living; for the Spa- 
niards and Friday's father lived in my old habita- 
tion, which they had enlarged exceedingly within ; 
the three servants, which they had taken in the 
late battle of the savages, lived with them ; and 
these carried on the main part of the colony, sup- 
plying all the rest with food, and assisting them in 
any thing as they could, or as they found necessity 
required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such 
refractory, ill-matched fellows, should agree about 
these women, and that two of them should not 
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two 
or three of them were, without comparison, more 
agreeable than the others : but they took a good 
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them- 
selves ; for they set the five women by themselves 
in one of their huts, and they went all into the 



310 THB LIFE AND ADYBHTURES 

Other £at, and drew lots among them who should 
choose first 

He that drew to choose first, went away hy him- 
self to the hut where the poor naked creatures 
were, and fetched out her he chose ; and it was 
worth observing, that he that chose first took her 
that was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of 
the five, which made mirth enough among the rest; 
and even the Spaniards laughed at it ; but the fel- 
low considered better than any of them, that it was 
application and business that they were to expect 
assistance in as much as any thing else, and she 
proved the best wife in the parcel. 

When the pocur women saw themselves in' a row 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of 
their condition returned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed that they were now going to be de- 
voured : accordingly, when the English sailor came 
in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a 
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took 
their leave of her with such agonies and such af- 
fection as would have grieved the hardest heart in 
the world ; nor was it possible for the Englishmen 
to satisfy them that they were not to be imme- 
diately murdered, till they fetched the old man, 
Friday's father, who instantly let them know, that 
the five men who had fetched them out one by one, 
had chosen them for their wives. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 1 

Whea they had done this, and the fright the wo- 
men were in was a little oyer, the men went to 
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them ; 
and in a few hours they had boilt them etery one 
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; for those 
they had already were crowded with their tools, 
hou8ehold-stu£^ and provisions. The three wicked 
ones had pitched farthest ofi^ and the two h(^ 
nest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of 
the island, so that they continued separate as be« 
fore: and thus my island was peopled in three 
places, and, as I might say, three towns were be* 
gun to be planted. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that 
as it often happens in the world (what the wise 
ends of God's providences are in such a disposition 
of things I cannot say), the two honest fellows had 
the two worst wives ; and the three reprobates that 
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for no- 
thing, and neither seemed bom to do themselves 
good, or any one else, had three clever, diligent, 
careful, and ingenious wives ; not that the two first 
*Were ill wives as to their temper or humour; for all 
the five were most willing, quiet, passive, and sub* 
jected creatures, rather like slaves than wives ; but 
my meaning is, they were not alike capable, inge- 
nious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honour 



Sit THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of a diligent applicadon on the one hand, and to 
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on 
the other, that when I came to the place, and 
yiewed the several improvements, planting, and 
management of the several little colonies, the two 
men had so fiir oatgone the three, that there was no 
comparison; they had indeed both of them as 
much ground laid out for corn as they wanted ; 
and the reason was, because, according to my rule, 
nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow 
more com than they wanted ; but the difference of 
the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and 
indeed every thing else, was easy to be seen at 
first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees 
planted about their huts, that when you came to 
the place nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and 
though they had their plantation twice demolished, 
once by their own countrymen, and once by the 
enemy, as shall be shewn in its place ; yet they had 
restored all again, and every thing was flourishing 
and thriving about them : they had grapes planted 
in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they 
had themselves never seen any thing of that kind ; 
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes 
were as good again as any of the others. They 
had also formed themselves a retreat in the thick*- 
est part of the woods, where, though there was not 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SIS 

a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one 
with incessant labour of their hands, and where, 
when the mischief which followed happened, they 
secured their wives and children so as they could 
sever be found; they having, by sticking innu- 
merable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I 
said, grew so easily, made a grove impassable ex- 
cept in one place, where they climbed up to get 
over the outside part, and then went in by ways of 
their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, 
Uiough they were much civilized by their new set- 
tlement compared to what they were before, and 
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same op- 
portunity, yet one of the certain companions of a 
profligate mind never left them, and that was their 
idleness. It is true, they planted corn, and made 
fences ; but Solomon's words were never better ve* 
rified than ii;i them : *' I went by the vineyard of 
the slothful, and it was overgrown with thorns ;" 
for when the Spaniards came to view their crop, 
they could not see it in some places for weeds ; the 
hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goats 
had gotten in and eaten up the corn; perhaps here 
and there a dead bush was crammed in to stop 
them out for the present, but it was only shutting 
the stiible-door afler the steed was stolen ; whereas, 
when they looked on the colony of the other two. 



314 THE LJFE AND ADVENTURES 

there was the very face of industry and success 
upon all they did ; there was not a weed to be seen 
in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; 
and they, on the other hand, yerified Solomon's 
words in another place : " The diligent hand ma- 
keih rich ;** for every thing grew and thrived, and 
they had plenty within and without; they had 
more tame cattle than the others^ more utensils 
wad necessaries within doors, and yet more plea- 
sore and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors; and having learnt the 
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of 
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their hus- 
bands* victuals very nicely ; whereas the other could 
not be brought to understand it; but then the has- 
band, who, as I said, had been cook's mate, did 
it himself; but as for the husbands of the three 
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles* eggs, and 
caught fish and birds ; ia a word, any thing but la- 
bour, and they fared accordingly. The diligent 
lived well and comfortably ; and the slothful lived 
liard and b^garly; and so I believe, generally 
peaking, it is all over the world. 

But now I come to a scene di£ferent from all 
that had happened before, either to them or me ; 
and the origin of the story was this : 




OF ROBINSON CRUSQE. 316 

Eariy one morning there came on shore fiye or 
six canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which 
you please ; and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 
slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the 
Spaniards, and/ to our men too, that they did not 
concern themselves about it as I did ; but having 
been made sensible, by their experience, that their 
only business was to lie concealed, and that, if they 
were not seen by any of the savages, they would 
go off again quietly when their business was done, 
having as yet not the least notion of there being 
any inhabitants in the island ; I say, having been 
made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but 
to give notice to all the three plantations to keep 
within doors, and not to shew themselves; only 
placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice 
when the boats went off to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a dis- 
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known 
among the savages, that there were inhabitants 
there, which was, in the end, the desolation of al- 
most the whole colony. After the canoes with the 
savages were gone ofi^ the Spaniards peeped abroad 
again, and some of them had the curiosity to go to 
the place where they had been, to see what they 
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, 
they found three savages left behind, and lying 



316. THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fast asleep upon the gound ; it was supposed they 
had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, 
that, like beasts, they were asleep, and would not 
stir when the others went, or they were wandered 
into the woods, and did not come back in time to 
be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this 
sight, and perfectly at a loss what to do; the Spa- 
niard governor, as it happened, was with them, and 
his advice was asked; but he professed he knew 
not what to do ; as for slaves, they had enough al- 
ready ; and as to killing them, they were noiife of 
them inclined to that The Spaniard governor 
told me they could not think of shedding innocent 
blood ; for as to them, the poor creatures had done 
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and 
they thought they had no just quarrel against them 
to take away their Hves. 

And her^ I must, in justice to these Spaniards, 
observe, tliat let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty 
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never 
met with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, 
in any foreign country, who were so universally 
modest, temperate, virtuous, so very good-humour- 
ed, and so courteous as these Spaniards; and, as 
to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very na- 
ture ; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous

pasnoni5> and yet all of them men of great courage 
and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their 
bearing the insufferable usage of the three English- 
men ; and their justice and humanity appeared now 
in the case of the savages as above. After some 
consultation they resolved upon this, that they 
would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these 
three men might be gone; but then the governor 
Spaniard recollected, that the three savages had no 
boat ; and that if they were left to rove about the 
island, they would certainly discover that there 
were inhabitants in it, and so they should be un- 
done that way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fast asleep still; so they resolved to 
awaken them, and take them prisoners ; and they 
did so. The poor fellows were strangely frighted 
when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid* 
like the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten ; for it seems those people think all the world 
do as they do, eating men's flesh ; but they were 
soon made easy as to that : and away they carried 
them. 

It was very happy for them that they did not 
carry them home to their castle; I mean to my pa* 
lace under the hill : but they carried them first to 
the bower, where was the chief of their country 



318 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

work : such as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the corn, &c. ; and afterwards they carried them to 
the habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do ; and whethw it 
was by negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thought the fellows could not mend themselves 
I know not, but one of them ran away, and ta- 
king into the woods, they could never hear of him 
more* 

They had good reason to believe he got home 
again soon after in some other boats or canoes of 
savagts, who came on shore three or four weeks 
afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as 
usual, went off again in two days time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly ; for they con- 
cluded> and that not without good cause indeed, 
that if this fellow got safe home among his com- 
rades, he would certainly give them an account 
that there were people in the island, as also how 
weak and few they were ; for this savage, as I ob- 
served before^i had never been told, as it was very 
happy he had not, how many they were, or where 
they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire 
of any of their guns, much less had they shew^n 
him any other of their retired places, such as the 
cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the 
two Englishmen had made, and the like. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S\9 

The first testimony they had that this fellow 
had giTen intelligence of them was^ that about two 
months after this six canoes of savages, with about 
seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came row- 
ing along the north side of the island, where they 
never used to come before, and landed about an 
hoar after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a 
mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, 
where this escaped man had been kept. As the 
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there 
the damage would not have been so much, for not 
a man of them would have escaped : but the case 
dififered now very much ; for two men to fifty were 
too much odds. The two men had the happiness 
to discover them about a league off, so that it was 
above an hour before they landed, and as they 
landed about a mile from their huts, it was some 
time before they could come at them. Now hal- 
ving great reason to believe that they were betray- 
ed, the first thing they did was to bind the slaves 
which were left, and cause two of the three men 
whom they brought with the women, who, it seems, 
proved very faithful to them, to lead them with 
their two wives, and whatever they could carry 
away with them, to their retired place in the 
woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to 
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard 
farther. 



3S0 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In the next place, seeing the savages were alt 
come on shore, and that they bent their course di- 
rectly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out> 
leaving their goats to straggle into the wood, whi- 
ther they pleased, that the savages might think 
they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came 
with them was too cunning for that, and gave them 
an account of it all, for they went directly to the 
place. 

When the poor frighted men had secured their 
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they 
had of the three, who came with the women, and 
who was at their place by accident, away to the 
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, 
and desire speedy help ; and in the mean time they 
took their arms, and what ammunition they had, 
and retreated towards the place in the wood where 
their wives were sent, keeping at a distance; yet so 
that they might see, if possible, which way the sa- 
vages took. 

They had not gone far but that, from a rising 
ground, they could see the little army of their ene- 
mies come on directly to their habitation, and in a 
moment more could see all their huts and house- 
hold-stuff flaming up together, to their great grief 
and mortification ; for they had a very great loss, 
and to them irretrievable, at least for some time. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S2l 

They kept their staticm far a while, till they found 
the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all 
over the place, rammaging every way, and every 
place they could think of, in search for prey, and 
in particular for the people, of whom it plainly ap- 
peared they had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them- 
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely 
some of the wild people might come that way, so 
they might come too many together, thought it 
proper to make anodier retreat about half a mile 
£irther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that 
the farther they strolled, the fewer would be to- 
gether. 

The next halt was at the entrance Into a very 
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old 
itrunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their stand- 
ing, resolving to see what might offer. 

They had not stood there long; but two of the 
savages appeared running directly that way, as if 
they had already notice where they stood, and were 
coming up to attack them ; and a little way far- 
ther they espied three more coming after them, 
and five more beyond them, all coming the same 
way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more 
at a distance, ranning another way ; for, in a word, 

TOU 11. X 



3» THE LIFE AND ADYENTURES 

they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for 
their game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe- 
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or 
fly ; but after a very short debate with themselves, 
they considered, that if the savages ranged the 
country thus before help came, they might, per* 
baps, find out their retreat in the woods, and then 
all would be lost ; so they resolved to stand them 
there ; and if there were too many to deal with, then 
they would get to the top of the tree, from whence 
they doubted not to defend themselves, fire except- 
ed, as long as their ammunition lasted, though all 
the savages that were landed, which were near fifty, 
were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered 
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait 
for the three, and so take the middle party, by 
which the two and the five that followed would be 
separated: at length they resolved to let the two 
first pass by, unless they should spy them in the 
tree, and come to attack them. The two first sa- 
vages also confirmed them in this resolution, by 
turning a little from them towards another part of 
the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, 
came forwards' directly to the tree, as if they had 
known the Englishmen were there. 

Seeing them come so straight towards them^ 

10 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S88 

they resolved to take them in a line as they came ; 
and as they resolved to fire but one at a time, per- 
haps the first shot might hit them all three ; to 
which purpose, the man who was to fire put three 
or four bullets into his piece, and having a fair 
loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the 
tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, wait- 
ing till they were within about thirty yards of the 
tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages 
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three 
was the runaway savage that had escaped from 
them, and they both knew him distinctly, and re- 
solved that, if possible, he should not escape, 
though they should both fire ; so the other stood 
ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the 
first shot, he should be sure to have a second. 

But the first was too good a marksman to miss 
his aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, 
a little behind in a line, in a word he fired, and hit 
two of them directly ; the foremost was killed out- 
right, being shot in the head ; the second, which 
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the 
body and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the 
third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps 
by the same ball that went through the body of 
the second ; and being dreadfully frighted, though 



aN THB UFE AHD ADTBMTURES 

not mnch hurt, tat domi opoa the gnNmd, acreaiii- 
mg and yelliiig in a hideous manner. 

The fire that were behind^ more Inghted with 
the noise than nnsible of their danger^ stood still 
at first; for the woods made the sound a thoosand 
times bigger than it really was ; the echoes rat- 
tiiog from one side to another, and the fowls rising 
from all parts, screaming and making, erery sort, 
a several kind of noise, according to their kind, 
just as it was when I fired the first gun that, per- 
haps, was ever shot off in that place since it was 
an island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcern- 
ed, till they came to that place where' their com^ 
panions lay, in a condition miserable enoagh ; and 
here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that 
they were within reach of the same mischief, stood 
all of a hnddle over the wounded man, talking, 
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he 
came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational to 
believe, told them that a flash of fire first, and im- 
mediately after that thunder fit)m their gods, had 
killed those two, and wounded him. This, I say, 
is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, 
as they saw no man near them, so they had never 
heard a gun in all their lives, or so much as heard 
of a gun ; neither knew they any thing of killing 



OF ROBIIf SON CRUSOE. SSI 

or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets; if 
they had, one might reasonably believe that they 
would not haye stood so unconcerned in viewing 
the fate of their fellows without some apprehension 
of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me 
it grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor 
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of 
their danger ; yet,- having them all thus in their 
power, and the first having loaded his piece again, 
resolved to let fly both together among them, and 
singling out by agreement which to aim at, they 
shot together, smd killed, or very much wounded^ 
four of them; the fifth, frighted even to deaths 
though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our 
men, seeing them all fall together, thought they 
had killed them alL 

The belief that the savages were all killed made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong step, and they were under some surprise 
when they came to the place, and found no less 
than four of the men alive, and of them two very 
little hurt, and one not at all : this obliged them 
to fall upon them with the stocks of their muft- 
kets i and first they made sure of the runaway sa« 
vage that had been the cause of all the mischief, 
and of another that was hurt in his knee, and put 



S26 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

them oat of their pain. Then the man that wa^ 
not hart at all came and kneeled down to them 
with his two hands held up, and made piteous 
moan to them by gestures and sigas for his life, 
but could not say one word to them that they 
could understand. 

However, they signified to him to sit down at 
the foot of a tree thereby ; and one of the Englisk- 
men, with a piece of rope-twine which he had by 
great chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast toge- 
ther, and his hands behind him, and there they 
left him; and with what speed they could make 
after the other two which were gone before, fear- 
ing they, or any more of them, should find the 
way to their covered place in the woods, where 
their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay. 
They came once in sight of the two men, but it 
was at a great distance; however, they had the 
satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards 
the sea, the quite contrary way from that which 
led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and 
being satisfied with that, they went back to the 
tree where they left their prisoner, who as they 
supposed was delivered by his comrades ; for he 
was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn with 
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of 
the tree. 

Tljey were now in as great a concern as before. 



OF ROBlNSOir CRUSOE. 38T 

not knowing what course to take, or liow near 
the enemy might be, or in what numbers; so 
they resolved to go away to the place where their 
wives were, to see if all was well there, and to 
make them easy, who were in fright enough to 
be sure ; for though the savages were their own 
country-folks, yet they were most terribly afraid 
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge 
they had of them. 

When they came thither, they found the savages 
had been in the wood, and very near the place, 
but had not found it ; for indeed it was inaccessible, 
by the trees standing so thick, as before, unless 
the persons seeking it had been directed by those 
that knew it, which these were not; they found, 
therefore, every thing very safe, only the women 
in a terrible fright. While they were here they 
had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming 
to their assistance : the other ten with their ser- 
vants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's, father, 
were gone in a body to defend their bower, and 
the corn and cattle that were kept there, in case 
the savages should have roved over to that side of 
the country ; but they did not spread so far. With 
the seven Sptiniards came one of the savages, who, 
as I said, were their prisoners formerly, and with 
them also came the savage whom the Englishmen 
bad left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it 



588 THK LIFE AND ADVBKTURES 

seems they came that way, saw the slanghter off 
the seven men, and unbound the eighth, and brought 
him along with them, where, however, they were 
obliged to bind him again, as they had d<me the 
two others, who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them; 
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that 
they thought they were under an absolute neces- 
sity to kill them for their own preservation: how- 
ever, the Spaniard governor would not consent to 
it; but ordered, that they should be sent out of 
the way to my old cave in the valley, and be kept 
there, with two Spaniards to guard them and give 
them food : which was done ; and they were boimd 
there hand and foot for that night 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen 
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy 
themselves to stay any longer there; but taking 
five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four 
muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout 
quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the 
savages. And first, they came to the tree wherp 
the men lay that had been killed ; but it was easy 
to see that some more of the savages had been 
there; for they attempted to carry thdir dead men 
away, and had dragged two of them a good way, 
but had given it over; from thence they advanced 
to the first rising ground, where they had stood and 



OF BOBIXSON CRUSOE. 9» 

seen their camp destroyed^ and where they had the 
mortification still to aee some of the smoke ; but 
neither could they here see any of the sayages: 
they then resolved, though with all possible cau- 
tion, to go forward towards their ruined planta* 
tion ; but a little before they came4hither, coming 
in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the sa- 
vages all embarking again in their canoes, in order 
to be gone. 

They seemed sorry at ' first that there was no 
way to come at them to give them a parting blow; 
bat upon the whole were very well satisfied to be 
rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, 
and all their improvements destroyed, the rest all 
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to 
assist them with needful supplies. Their three 
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having 
the least inclination to do any thing good, yet, as 
soon as they heard of it (for they, living remote, 
knew nothing till ail was over,) came and ofiered 
their help and assistance, and did very fri&adly 
work for several days to restore their habitations, 
and make necessaries for them ; and thus in a little 
time they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this, they had the farther 
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages canoes 
come driving on shore, and at some distance from 
them, with two drowned men ; by which they had 



«y THE Uf B AND AJ>VENTVRE8, &c. 

m 

reason to believe that they had met with a storm 
at sea, which had overset some of them, for it blew 
very hard the ni^t after they went off! 

However, as some might miscarry, so on the 
other hand enough of them escaped to inform the 
rest, as well of what they had done, as of what 
happened to them ; and to whet them on to another 
enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, 
resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry 
M before them ; for except what the first man had 
told them of inhabitants, they could say' little to it 
of their own knowledge; for they.%ver saw one 
man, and the fellow being killec^hat had affirmed ' 
it, they had no other witnesses to confirm it -to 
them.
