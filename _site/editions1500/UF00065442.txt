Copyright, 1888, by Hum 82 Bauhaus--All righls reserved.PREFACE.

HE first settlement in Australia was made in 1788; consequently
the inhabitants of the great southern continent are this year cele
brating their centennial. Three millions of people settled in five great
colonies, possessing all the characteristics of an advanced civilization,
with the unity developed by a common language and a common alle~
giance, and the rivalry that springs from the independence of each
colony by itself, are uniting in the centennial celebration, and contrast
ing the Australia of today with that of one hundred years ago.
Previous to the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, Americans
had but little knowledge of that faraway-land. The opening of the
auriferous fields attracted the attention of the whole civilized world to
the antipodes, and many Americans joined the multitude that went
thither in search of wealth. Since that time our relations with Aus-
tralia have, year by year, grown more intimate. Railways across our
continent and steamship lines over the broad Pacific have brought
Sydney and Melbourne in juxtaposition to New York and San Fran-
cisco, and in this centennial Australian year we may almost regard the
British colonies under the Southern Cross as our nextdoor neighbors.
The writer of this volume is not aware that any illustrated book
descriptive of Australia and its neighboring colonies, New Zealand and
Tasmania, by an American author, or from an American press, has ever
yet appeared. Believing such a book desirable, he sent those youthful
veterans of travel, Frank Bassett and Fred Bronson, over the route indi-
cated on the title-page, with instructions to make careful note of what
they saw and learned. Under the guidance of their mentor and our old
friend Doctor Bronson they carried out their instructions to the letter,
and the results of their observations will be found in the following
pages. Trusting that the book will meet the favor that has been ac-
corded to previous volumes of the "Boy Traveller" series, they offer
their present work as their contribution to the Australian centennial,
and hope that the boys and girls of their native land will find pleasure
and profit in its perusal.

The method followed in the preparation of previous volumes of the
series has been observed in the present book as far as it was possible to
do so. The author's personal knowledge of the countries and people of
Australasia has been supplemented by information drawn from many
sources--from books, newspapers, maps, and other publications, and
from numerous Australian gentlemen whom he has known or with
whom he has been in correspondence. During the progress of the
work he has kept a watchful eye on the current news from the an-
tipcdes, and sought to bring the account of the condition of the rail-
ways, telegraphs, and other constantly changing enterprises down to
the latest dates.

Many of the books consulted in the preparation of "The Boy Trav-
ellers in Australasia" are named in the text, but circumstances made it
inconvenient to refer to all. Among the volumes used are the following:
Wallace's "Australasia," Forrest's "Explorations in Australia," War-
burton's " Journey Across the Western Interior of Australia," Alexan-
der's "Bush-fighting in the Maori War," Smyth's "Aborigines of Vic-
toria," Bodham-Whetham's "Pearls of the Pacific," Murray's "Forty
Years of Mission Work in Polynesia," Cumming's "At Home in Fiji,"
Markham's "Cruise of the Rosario," Palmer's "Kidnapping in the
South Seas," Buller's "Forty Years in New Zealand," "Australian
Pictures," Harcus's "South Australia," Eden's "Australia's Heroes,"
Trollope's "Australia and New Zealand," and Nordhofi's "Northern
California, Oregon, and the Sandwich Islands."

The publishers have kindly allowed the use of illustrations that have
appeared in Hanna's MAGAZINE and other of their publications, and
these illustrations have admirably supplemented those that were spe-
cially prepared for the book. The maps on the front and rear covers
were specially drawn from the best authorities, and are intended to
embody the most recent explorations and the latest developments of the
railway systems of the Australian colonies.

AND, HO !" from the masthead.
" Where away ?" from the bridge. -

"Dead ahead, sir l" was the reply; but it was almost drowned by
the buzz of excitement
which the announce-
ment produced. The
passengers, who had
been strolling about the
decks or listlessly loung-
ing in their chairs, rush-
ed hastily forward, in
their eagerness to catch
a. glimpse of the land
which had been report
ed " (lead ahead."

This happened on
board the steamship
Alameda, early one
pleasant afternoon as she was nearing the Sandwich Islands on a voy-

age from San Francisco. There
were three passengers who did
not join in the scramble towards
the bow of the ship, but remained
quietly seated in their chairs.
They had been through the ex-
perience of sightingland from a
steamer at sea too many times to
regard it as a novelty.

They 'were our old friends,
Doctor Bronson and his nephews,
Frank Bassett and Fred Bronson,
whose experiences and. adventures

T" ""5""- in various parts of the world are

familiar to many American youths.

Not content with what they had seen in Asia, Africa, and Europe, they

were now bound on a. voyage to. the antipodes with the intention of

adding another volume to the series in which their wanderings are re-
corded.*

It was on the eighth day of a. voyage over the lovely azure waters
of the broad Pacific that the Ahmwda neared the land, and many of
her passengers half regretted that they were about to separate. The
weather had been delightful, the breezes were light, the sky was nearly
always clear, and the temperature high enough to make thick clothing
uncomfortably warm, and an awning over the deck desirable. Since

* " The Boy Travellers in the Fur East" (five volumes), and "The Boy Travellers in
South America," "The Boy Travellers in the Russian Empire," and "The Boy Travel-
lers on the Congo " (three volumes). See complete list at the end of this book.A " PORTUGUESE MAN--OF--WAR.';' 3

the second day out from San Francisco not a sail had been seen, as the
sailing-ships take another track in order to obtain stronger and more
favoring winds. Four or five whales had shown themselves, and a few
schools of porpoises played around the vessel from time to time as
though they wished to make the'acquaintance of the strange monster.

Flying-fish were numerous, and so were those curious denizens of
the deep popularly known as "Portuguese men-of-war." One of the
latter was caught by means of a bucket; a verdant passenger who ad-
mired its beautiful colors took it in his hand for a careful examination,
but on feeling a stinging sensation he dropped it immediately. Doctor
Bronson consoled him with the information that the scientific name of
the Portuguese man-of-war is Physah'e pelagica, and its power of sting--
ing enables it to benumb its prey. It consists principally of an air-sac
which floats it upon the 'Water, and has long tentacles hanging down at '
various lengths. These tentacles are armed with stings; they paralyze
any small fish that comes within their reach, and then act as fingers to
sweep up the prize. It is a favorite trick of sailors to induce a novice
to pick up a captured physalia, so that they may enjoy his haste in
dropping it.

As the Alameda continued her course the outline of the land grew
more and more distinct, revealing the rugged volcanic cliffs of Oahu,
and reminding the passengers of the burning mountains for which the
Sandwich Islands are famous. The course of the vessellay through the
Molokai Channel, leaving Molokai Island on the left, and hugging
closely against the surf-beaten shores of Oahu, on which the capital,
Honolulu, is situated. Near the water there were occasional groves of
cocoanut-trees; but on the whole
the shore was less tropical in ap-
pearance than our young friends
had expected to find it.

Every eye was straining to catch
a view of Honolulu; but when its
position was pointed out most of
the passengers were unable to dis-
' cover any marked indications of the ' m ISLAND 0" WW-
presence of a town. After a time '
the steamer made a sharp turn to the starboard; and passed through the
narrow channel which leads into the pretty harbor of Honolulu. Then
the town appeared rather suddenly in view; its houses surrounded by
groves of palms and tamarind-trees, interspersed with other tropical

deep basin in a coral reef,
and so perfectly land-

rily as smooth as a mill-
pond, and is safe in all

is good anchorage for

ance. Numerous small
boats were darting about,
and almost before the en-
gines were stopped the
little craft swarmed in
great force about the
steamer.

a series of volcanic mount.

sand feet high, and from
the town itself to the foot
of these mountains the
ground rises in a gentle

from the harbor is an ex-

son called the attention
of the youths to a val-
ley opening through the
mountains, and to the
contrast between the
cliffs and slopes, and the
bright waters immediate-
ly around them. All
agreed that the place wasSIGHT--SEEING IN HONOLULU. 5

very prettily situated, and the view was a great relief after the monot-
onous voyage from San Francisco.

As soon as possible the party left the steamer and proceeded to the
hotel, and, without waiting to see the rooms assigned to them, started
out for a sight-seeing stroll. They desired to make the most of their
time, as they expected to continue their journey in a week or ten days
at farthest. The Alanwda was to return to San Francisco as soon as
she could land her cargo and receive another; the regular mail steamer
for Australia would touch at Honolulu at the time indicated, and it was
by this steamer they were to proceed southward.

 

1N THE HARBOR 0F HONOLULU.

As they walked along the streets, accompanied byi'a guide whom
they had engaged at the hotel, Doctor Bronson gave the youths-a brief
history of the Sandwich Islands, which Fred afterwards committed to
paper lest it might escape his memory. Substantially it was as follows:

" The famous navigator Captain Cook has the credit of discovering
these islands in 177 8, but they were known to the Spaniards more than
a century before that time. The death of Captain Cook served to bring
the islands into prominence; he named them after Lord Sandwich, who
was then First Lord of the Admiralty, but they are known here as the
Hawaiian Islands, Hawaii being the largest of the group."

"That is the-island where Captain Cook was killed, is it not 2" in-
quired one of the youths.
" Yes," was the reply. "It was at Kealakeakua Bay, in sight of the
great volcano of Manna Loa. The famous navigator did not get along
well with the natives, who, like nearly all savages, were addicted to
thieving. One of his boats having been stolen, he determined to seize

the King and hold him a prisoner until the boat was returned. For
this purpose he landed with a lieutenant and nine men; the natives
suspected his intentions, and a fight ensued, which resulted in his .
death."

" And they devoured him, it is said," Frank remarked.

"As to that," replied the Doctor, "there has been much dispute.
Captain King, the successor of Cook, and historian of the expedition
after the latter's death, positively declares that the body of Cook was
eaten, along with the bodies of the sailors and marines who were
killed at the same time. On the other hand, the islanders declare with
equal positiveness that cannibalism did not exist here at that time;
and though great indignities might have been perpetrated, the horrible
accusation is untrue. At this distance of time it is impossible to say
what happened, and we will dismiss the subject. But it is generally
conceded that the great navigator owed his death to his severity in
dealing with the natives, and his imprudence in venturing on shore
with the small force which accompanied him.

" But we'll leave the famous captain at rest," continued the Doctor,
"while we give our attention to more modern things. Great changes
have taken place in the hundred years or so that have elapsed sinceWORK OF THE MISSIONARIES. 7

Captain Cook's death. Then the people were savages and idolaters;
now they are civilized and Christianized, and may be considered a
harmless and kindly disposed race. Education is universal among
them, hardly a. native of Hawaii being unable to read and write.
Every child is obliged to attend the public schools, and there is a'
special school-tax of two dollars on every voter, in addition to a gen-
eral tax for educational purposes. Schools are in every part of the
islands where there is any population, and the teachers are paid out
of the taxes I have mentioned."

 

KEALARBAKUA BAY, WHERE CAPTAIN COOK WAS KILLED.

"I suppose the missionaries are to be credited with the spread -of
education here, are they not Q" one of the youths asked.

"Yes," was the reply; "and there have been no more earnest and
energetic missionaries anywhere in the world than those that came to
the Hawaiian Islands. The first missionaries arrived here in 1820,
and for thirty-three years the mission enterprise was supported by
contributions in the United States and elsewhere. In that time the
donations of Christian people in the United States for the conversion
of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands amounted to more than
nine hundred thousand dollars."
"What was done at the end of that time 2" Fred asked.
"In 1853 the missionaries reported that the people of the Hawaiian
Islands had been converted to Christianity, and that idolatry no longer

existed among them. Then it was voted by the American Board of
Missions that 'thc Sandwich Islands, having been Christianized, shall
no longer receive aid from this Board.' From that time the churches
have been practically self-suplmrting, though they have received some
aid from America>> At present the Hawaiian Islands have a missionary
society of their own which is sending missionaries and teachers into
other islands of the Pacific; and they have a printing-office, where
Bibles are printed in several Polynesian languages--just as BiblesNA CHURCH CARRIED BY A WHALHHIP. '9

were formerly printed in New York for the use of the Sandwich
Islanders."

Here the guide interrupted them to point out Kawaiaho church,
which he said was the first native church in Honolulu, a substantial
and well-built edifice that reminded the strangers of many churches
they had seen in the New England States. In reply to Frank's remark
to this effect Doctor Bronson said that the most of the early mission-
aries came from Boston and its vicinity, and it was therefore to be
expected that the churches would be of the New England pattern.

 

KA'VAXAHO CHURCH--Elm NATIVE CHURCH IX HONOLULU.

Fred asked if the church they were passing was the first ever built
in the islands. The guide explained that it was the first Woe church,
but not the first American one. That honor belongs to the Seamen's
(or Bethel) church, which was sent from Boston in a whale-ship around
Cape Horn; it was brought in pieces, and set up soon after the ship
arrived here. Honolulu has been for a long time a great resort for
whalemen, and about 1846 special attention was paid to their needs by
the establishment of atBethel church and society.

ary enterprise was Rev. Mr. Demon, who obtained the reputation of an

in consequence of his paternal care and his kindness towards all who
came within his influence. He established a. Seamen's Home in connec-
tion with the church, and it has been of great use in keeping the sailors
away from the evil influences that are found in most ocean ports.

find churches everywhere, and not far from each church there is a, na-
tive school-house where the children are taught to read and write. On
Sunday the churches are filled with worshippers, and there is no more
devout people anywhere than on these islands. There are now more
churches than are needed by the population, for the reason, not that
there is any decline in religious zeal, but because of the decrease in the
number of inhabitants. At the time of Captain Cook's discovery the
islands were estimated to have a. population of not far from two hun-
dred thousand. Small-pox, measles, and other diseases have made ter-
rible havoc, and at present the native population is little if any above
fifty thousand. It has been declining with more or less rapidity ever
since the beginning of the century, and the last census showed a con-
siderable falling off since the one that preceded it.

 

fllE own-nous: IN HONOLULU.

"Not only are the islanders diminishing in numbers," he continued,
" but the people of today are said to be smaller in stature than those
of a. century ago. The missionaries and other old residents say that
when they first came here they used to meet great numbers of natives
of high stature and majestic figures, belonging generally to the old
families of chiefs and nobles. Occasionally at this time you may see
them, but not often."
"I suppose the chiefs and nobles were of a. difl'erent race," Frank
remarked, " otherwise they would all be of the same general height."

" That was formerly supposed to be the case," was the reply, "and
even now the theory is sustained by many people. But I believe the
general opinion is that all were
of the same race, and the superior
development of the chiefs and no-
bles was due to their easier life and
better food, which could hardly
fail to have an effect through many
generations." . .

One of the youths asked if the
people received the missionaries
kindly, and showed a desire to be
instructed and civilized.

"In a general way they did,"
was the reply, "though thatwas
by no means always the case.
Some of the chiefs looked suspi- -
ciously upon the coming of the
strangers, fearing, and not without
reason, that their power would be
diminished as their subjects became
enlightened. The King was favor-
able to the work of the missiona-

xmrx asmms or noxoww- ries, and consequently the hostility
V of the chiefs could not be exer-
cised with severity. Before the advent of the missionaries the Ha-
waiians had no written language. The missionaries reduced the lan-
guage to writing, prepared school-books, a dictionary, 8. hymn-book,
and a translation of a part of the Scriptures, all in the native tongue,
and they trained the native teachers who were needed for the man-
agement of the schools then and afterwards established.
' " In this way the missionaries gave the Hawaiian people the bene-
fits of civilization, and year by year saw the old superstitions and one
toms disappearing. Some of them still remain, but not many; just as
in New England you may to this day find people who believe in witch-
craft, and all over the United States persons who have implicit faith in
supernatural things. The Hawaiians are by no means perfect in their
morals and beliefs, and you can find iniquity in Honolulu, just as youSIGHTS IN THE STREETS. 13

may find it in Boston or Philadelphia. Murder and theft were very
common a hundred years ago; now the former crime is quite as rare
as in the United States, and as for the latter, it is even more so. Near-
ly all the stealing in the islands is done by Chinese or other foreign-
ers, and not by the natives."

Our friends passed near the court-house, which bore a marked re-
semblance to an American town-hall in a prosperous town, and stood
at the edge of a well-kept garden. The Doctor remarked that court-
houses and jails were some of the adjuncts of' all civilized lands, and
therefore they were needed in Hawaii as well as elsewhere. " But I
am told," he continued, "that the majority of the inmates of the jail
at Honolulu are of other races than the Hawaiian, and that Americans
and English form a good proportion."

A little way beyond the court-
house our friends met a man carry-
ing two covered baskets slung at the
ends of a short pole which rested on
his shoulder. Frank turned to the
guide and asked what the man was
carrying.

"He's a poi peddler," was the re-
ply, " and I wonder you have not met
one before, as there are many of
them. He peddles poi, and the people
buy it to eat."

He then explained that poi is the
national dish of the islands, and is
made from the taro-root, which is the
Sandwich Island form of the potato.
He pointed out a taro-garden, and
said that there were many such gar-
dens in and around Honolulu, as the u
natives did not consider a home com-- 1mm," mam,"
plete without one.

The taro-root is baked in an underground oven, and then mashed
very fine, so that it would be like flour if the moisture were expelled.
After it has been thoroughly mashed it is mixed with water, and in
this condition is ready for eating. It has an agreeable taste when
fresh, and most foreigners like it upon the first trial. For native use
it is allowed to ferment; when fermented it suggests sour paste to theHAWAIIAN

uneducated palate, and is nauseating to the novice. Natives greatly
prefer it in this form, and a good many foreigners cultivate their taste
until they too would rather have their poi sour than fresh.

Soon after the islands were settled by foreigners an ingenious
Yankee saw a chance for making money by importing machinery for
making poi, in place of the old form of hand~crushing. Now there are
factories in various parts of the island where poi is made in large quan-
tities, chiefly for the use of planters and other large consumers. It
forms quite an article of export to other islands where Polynesian
labor is employed, and especially to the guano islands, where nothing
can be cultivated. A former king of Hawaii established a poi factory
at Honolulu, and by so doing became very unpopular with his subjects,
just as has been the case with other kings who have introduced labor-
saving machinery into their dominions.

 

 

HAWAIIANB AT A YEAST.

At dinner that evening Frank and Fred asked for poi and were
promptly supplied. It was explained to them that the native way of
eating it was to insert the forefinger in the dish, twirl it around until
it was well coated with the sticky substance, and then draw the finger
through the mouth. Both the youths concluded that they would allow
the natives to monopolize that form of eating, which was hardly to be
reconciled with civilized customs. They contented themselves with
spoons, which answered their purpose completely.

Poi, fish, and pork are the min
cipal articles of food among the
Hawaiians; but at a feast several
articles are added that do not come
into the daily bill of fare. The
guide took Frank and Fred to a
native hum, or festival, and pointed
out the following dishes: poi, fish
and pork, as already mentioned;
baked ti-root, which bore a striking
resemblance to molasses-cake, of
which New Englanders are fond,
and the resemblance included both '
appearance and taste; raw shrimps
and limu, which is a sea-moss smell-
ing and tasting very disagreeably,
to the novice; kuulaau, which is an
agreeable compound of cocoa-nut
and taro-root; paalolo, a combina-
tion of cocoa-nut and SWeet-potato,

"I" H" mbm- of a sweetish taste; and two or

three additional mixtures of the

same sort. Then there were cuttle-fish raw and cooked, roasted dog,

and a small quantity of pickled salmon, liberally dosed with red pepper.

Fred suggested that as the salmon was imported, and therefore expen-

sive, the red pepper was freely added in order that the article would
be sparingly eaten.

The guide, who was a native, explained that the feast was for the
purpose of enabling the giver to build a new house, and each guest was
expected to pay fifty cents for his entertainment. He pointed out a
calabash bowl lying on the ground as the receptacle of the money, as
it was a matter of etiquette for the master not to receive the cash
directly from the hands of his guests. The affair had been arranged
some time beforehand, and the price of the feast was mentioned in the
invitation. Everybody was in new clothes, it being one of the Bar.A HAWAIIAN FEAST. 17

waiian customs that every garment worn at a feast must be quite new,
and a native would rather be absent from the entertainment than vio-
late this point of etiquette. Five or six men who served as stewards
were dressed exactly alike, each of them wearing a green shirt and red
trousers, made for the occasion. In addition to this, they had green
wreaths on their heads, and most of the persons present had their heads
decked with flowers or leaves.

The diners sat on the ground, and as they took their places their
portions of roast pig, neatly wrapped in ti-leaves, were distributed to
them. They were expected to be satisfied with their allowance, and
etiquette forbade their asking for more of this article, though they
could help themselves freely to anything else. When the feast was
over each one carried away whatever of his roast pork was uncon-
sumed. The guide said it would be very impolite to leave any portion
of it, and even the bones were cam'ed away. The feeding was not
done in a hurry; a native feast lasts for several hours, the guests
pausing two or three times to get up a fresh touch of_appetite, and
occasionally walking about, singing, dancing, talking, or laughing, in
order to increase the capacity of their stomachs.

Our young friends tasted some of the dishes, and each dropped a
half-dollar in the calabash bowl that was designated as the receptacle
of the contributions of the guests. They carried away their portions
of roast pig, and gave the packages to some urchins whom they en-
countered a short distance from the scene of the feast. The latter
immediately sat down to'enjoy the toothsonie delicacy, and no doubt
imagined themselves 'to be for, the time the most favored beings
in the land. Their appearance indicated that roast pig did not of-
ten enter into their bill of fare, and the rapidity with which they
attacked the contents of the packages showed that they had not
dined.

Frank thought it must have been a, great change for the people
of the islands-when they abandoned their old custom of going with-
out clothing and adopted the dress of civilization. When it is remem-
bered that a hundred years ago the islanders were naked savages, the
remark of the youth is not to be wondered at. The missionaries say
that in the early days the attempts of the natives to adopt European
dress were decidedly ludicrous; they could not understand the. neces'
sity of three or more garments, but thought a single one sufficient to
begin with. A hat, a shirt, and a. pair of trousers were considered
enough for three, and some of them used to argue that these garments

were altogether too numerous for one- individual, when there were so
many others without anything. ' ' '

Fred made a sketch of a group of women, and afterwards procured
several photographs showing how the feminine natives of the islands
are ordinarily clad. 0n the back of the sketch he wrote as follows:

" The dress of the women can hardly be called picturesque, but after
being seen a few times its oddity is not as apparent as at first. Most
of the women go bareheaded, or with wreaths of leaves and flowers in
their hair. Their dress hangs from the shoulders without being gath-
ered in at the waist, and quite closely resembles the morning wrapper of
civilized lands, though it is not so ornamental. Black, dark, and pink are
the usual colors of the dress, but on festive occasions something gayer
can be frequently seen. You would be surprised to see the grace and
dignity with which the older women carry themselves, and I think
much of it is due to the loosely flowing dress."CLIMATE-0F THE ISLANDS. ' 19

The climate is so mild that heavy clothing is not needed. The
heat is of course greater in the lowlands than among the mountains,
whose highest peaks are covered with snow for a. considerable part of
the year. Honolulu is said to be the hottest place in the kingdom,
and thin clothing, but not the thinnest, is worn there the entire year.
White is worn a great deal, but it is so easily soiled that a good many
prefer to wear garments of blue serge, or blue or gray flannel. Flannel
is desirable for the winter months, but the islands are so near the equa
tor that the difference between winter and summer is not very great.

In December and January
the temperature sometimes fails
to 62deg Fahrenheit in the early
morning, but by noon, or 2 an,
it generally reaches 75deg or 76deg,
and remains between that point
and 70deg until midnight. In July
the highest point reached is 86deg,
and on a few occasions 87deg. The
extreme range of the thermome-
ter is not more than 26deg or 28deg,
which makes it a. very com-
fortable climate to live in. It
is said to be an excellent one
for persons suffering from pul-
monary complaints, though it
is somewhat debilitating for
healthy men and women accus-
tomed to the rigorous climate of
the northern States of America.

Residents of the islands say
there are regions among the
mountains where the nights are
invariably cool enough for a fire
all the year round, while the nuns-1- mom or-mwm.
days are never hot. Even in
Honolulu the air is not as sultry as that of New York or Philadelphia
in July and August, and the greatest heat experienced is almost always
tempered by a breeze. There is more rain in winter than in summer,
but there is no really dry season. It is a circumstance that strikes
the stranger curiously that there is much more rain on the windward
side of the islands than on the leeward; sometimes the former will have
a great deal of rain, while the latter gets little or hardly any. The
trade-wind controls the rainfall, and by ascertaining where it strikes a
new-comer may have much or little rain accordingly as he selects his
place of residence.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GRASS HOUSE, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

The guide told the youths that they could sit on the veranda of the
hotel at Honolulu and see the rain fall every day, but without getting
a drop within the limits of the city. "You may be here all day in the
sunshine," said he; " but if you are going to the windward side of the
island you must take your rubber overcoats. The showers that you see
from the hotels are from the clouds that have been blown over the
mountains, and as soon as you cross the range you will be in the midst
of them."

Doctor Bronson said that the decrease in the population of the isl-
ands had been, by some people, attributed to the adoption of clothing
by the natives. "It is argued," said he, " that the people are very care-
less, and have not learned the sanitary laws which govern the use of
clothing. A native thinks nothing of lying down with his wet clothes
upon him when he has been soaked by a rain or dipped in the surf; it
is hard to make him understand that such a practice is dangerous, and
many of the inhabitants have died of the severe colds contracted in
this way."

In the outskirts of the city our friends came to a house which the
guide said was a. good specimen of the native dwelling, and they ob--
tained permission to enter and examine it. It had a door, but no win-
dows; was a single story in height, and its sides were made of upright
sticks interwoven with palm-leaves, while the roof was thatched with
grass. The floor was of solid earth covered with mats, and at one end
there was a. sort of platform raised a. foot' higher than the rest. This
platform was the sleeping-place of the inmates, and was elevated in
order to insure its freedom from dampness in case of a heavy rain. In
front of the house was a bench, where one might sit in the shade during
the afternoon, and where no doubt the owner idled away a considerable
part of his time. The islanders are not fond of_ha,rd work, and in fact
they have no occasion to labor as industriously as do the inhabitants of
more rigorous regions.

Around Honolulu the expense of living is greater than it is away
from the port, owing to the increased price of the products of the fields.

 

GOVERNXBNT BUILDINGS, HONOLULU. -

In the country it may be said that a man who works two days in the
week can support his family comfortably, especially if he is near the
seacoast, whence he can obtain a supply of fish at any time he chooses
to go .for them. Fishing, taro-planting, and making poi are his chief
occupations, and to these he generally adds mat-weaving, which is
neither difficult nor laborious. His wants are few and easily supplied,
and it is no wonder that the islander displays an unwillingness to wear
himself out in constant toil. The conditions of life do not require him
to do so, and he lacks the ambition to accumulate a, fortune solely for
the sake of accumulating it.

After dinner the guide proposed that the strangers should witness a
lmlaflmla, or native dance. It was quite unlike the dancing of Euro-
pean countries, consisting principally of more or less active movements
of the limbs while the body of the dancer swayed from side to side.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

llA'VAHAN DANCIRG-OIRLS.

The dancers were girls dressed in short frocks like those worn by
American school-girls; they had wreaths in their hair and around their
ankles, and their dresses were loosely gathered in at the waist, where
they were held by cords. The music was supplied by two men who
struck their hands upon large calabashes and sang or chanted a low
monotonous air. A very little of the dance satisfied the curiosity of
the visitors, and they returned to the hotel at an early hour.

The Hawaiians have another dance, which can be seen at their fes-
tivals; it is performed by men and women, usually elderly people, and
is accompanied by singing, in which all may join. Then there areTHE HULA--HULA AND OTHER muons. 23

dances for the younger people, but they are not generally practised,
owing to the opposition of the missionaries, and possibly to the un'willv
ingness of the people to indulge in active exercise unless they are paid
for it. All the dances have descended from the days before the advent
of the foreigners, and therefore have an interest for any one who de-
sires to learn whatever he can about the history of the islanders.

I-IE next day was devoted to excursions in the immediate vicinity
of Honolulu, a carriage-drive through the principal streets of the
town, a visit to the palace and other Government buildings, and two or
three calls to present letters of introduction. The visit to the palace
included an introduction to the King, Kalakaua, who received his visit
ors politely and devoted a short time to their entertainment. The con-
versation referred mainly to the United States, and barely touched upon
matters connected with the islands.
In their drive about the city Frank and Fred found that Honolulu is
a well-built town with narrow streets. The houses are mostly of wood,
dropped down rather carelessly in many places, with little attempt at
uniformity, and not much decoration. The amount of tropical verdure,
which almost concealed many of the villas and detached residences in
the side streets and outskirts of the place, recalled Ceylon and other
regions near the equator which they had visited in their former travels.
Frank thought he could readily imagine himself in the suburbs of Co-
lombo, while Fred was inclined to close his eyes for a moment and
think he had been transported on the enchanted carpet of the Arabian
Nights to Batavia or Buitenzorg, in Java. In many of the court-yards
fountains were playing, the drops of water sparkling in the bright sun-
shine, and adding materially to the beauty of the scene.EQUESTRIAN PERFORMANCES OF THE NATIVES. 25

There are some fine residences in Honolulu, but none that would be
considered of much consequence in a wealthy capital of Europe. The
best buildings are the public ones, and in the list we must include the
Hawaiian hotel, as it was built by the Government at an expense that
was considered a heavy one for the country to bear. Near the hotel is
the theatre, which is also a Government affair, and brings very little
revenue to its owners. It is in use occasionally whenever a strolling
company on a voyage between Australia. and America happens along
and gives a few performances. Honolulu is hardly able to support a
theatre through the entire year, as the portion of the population able
and willing to patronize it is very small.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LAIIAINA, ISLAND or "Mil.

Frank and Fred were amused at the equestrian performances of the
natives, and particularly at the dash and energy with which the laugh-
ing girls pushed their horses at full speed. They rode " man-fashion,"
bestricling the horse instead of sitting on a sidesaddle, and few of them
seemed contented with any but the most rapid pace. The horses of the
Hawaiian Islands are small but strong, and capable of great endurance;
in fact, if they were otherwise it is evident they would not live long,
when the habits of the natives are remembered. In travelling in the ,
Hawaiian Islands it is necessary to carry your saddle, as carriage-roads

are not numerous, and a good many places that one wishes to visit can-
not be reached by wheeled vehicles. Of course it is possible to hire
saddles when hiring horses, but this is by no means universally the case.

"'0!!! ON HORSB'BACK, HONOLULU.

The afternoon drive was extended to the Pali, a mountain-pass six
miles out of the town, and one of the chief attractions to visitors who
can only make a brief stay at Honolulu. Outside of the business por-
tion of the place our friends entered upon a straight and very dusty
road, which for the first two miles and more led among the villas
belonging to the merchants and other well-to-do people who make
Honolulu their home. Each villa stands in a garden by itself, and the
houses are often rendered invisible by the masses of foliage that sur-
round them, and the creeping and climbing plants that rise to their
very tops. The road steadily rises, and consequently the occupants of
the houses have fine views of the bay and town; while the mountains
rise behind them to form a background. Fred was so charmed with
the beauty of the scene that he wished to sketch some of the villas, but
the recollection of their limited time prevented his carrying the desire
iuto execution.WATER SUPPLY or HONOLULU. 27

Beyond this region of villas the carriage'entered the foot-hills,
where the road wound with a steep grade among taro-fields, in which
men were at work up to their knees in water tending the plants which
yield to the Hawaiian the stall? of Life. The water which irrigates the
taro-fields is brought by innumerable streams from the sides of the
mountains, to which it is supplied by the clouds borne by the trade-
winds. Honolulu receives its water from the mountains, and there is
certainly an abundance of it.

Beyond the taro-fields there is good grazing for cattle and sheep, of
which there are numerous herds and flocks. 'Frank called attention to
a, water-fall some distance army, which made a. pretty contrast with
the dark sides of the mountain, and was evidently nearly, if not quite,

' two hundred feet in height. At one of the turns of the road the car-
riage came in contact with a, cart which was descending the slope too
swiftly for safety; the damage was trifling, but for a few moments
things wore a serious aspect, as there was a. good chance of being tossed
over the side of the almost precipitous slope.

There were not many travellers along the road, the most pictu-
resque being groups of girls on horseback and the herders who Were
driving cattle to market or for a change of pasture. The girls were
generally in bright-mlored robes, which were gathered in at the waist
with brighter sashes that streamed behind them as they dashed along

the road. Most of them wore straw hats on their heads, and generally
the hats were adorned with flowers in wreaths and festoons, which were
most liberally bestowed. Now and then Frank's attention was drawn
to a pretty face which surmounted a. neck adorned with a. string of
blossoms of gaudy colors; the necklace formed an admirable setting
for the complexion, but sometimes the blossoms were not chosen with
due regard to the contrast of colors. '

The Hawaiian cow-boys, or cattle-drivers, were not unlike their
American prototypes, as they wore broad-brimmed hats and bright-
colored scarfs; they were mounted on tough little horses, and sat in
saddles of the American cow-boy pattern, the pommel rising high, and
the stirrups made of wood. Then there were strings of pack-mules and
horses coming down from the points in the mountains inaccessible toTHICKETS 0F HOW--TREES. 29

wheeled vehicles, and now and then our friends met a Chinese gardener
taking the produce of his little patch to market on the back of a pack
animal, and in some instances on a wheelbam'ow. A few groups of
men and women on foot were encountered, but the number was so
small that Frank and Fred concluded that the Hawaiians were a home-
loving people, and did not wander'ahout much.

N ear the Pauli the road passed through thickets of how-trees, which
resembled the growths of manzanita on the slopes of the California foot~
hills. These thickets are so dense that it is impossible for man or
horse to pass through them; in fact they are impenetrable to any but
the smallest animals. Frank thought he would like to cut a cane as a
souvenir, but refrained from doing so when reminded by Fred that he
could probably buy all the canes he wanted in Honolulu.

 

MOUNTAIN SCENE IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

Suddenly from the other side of the narrow pass a wonderful pano-
rama was presented. Around on each side were the rugged cliffs of
the mountain range, while in front they looked from a height of eight
or nine hundred feet above the sealevel upon a picture which included
every variety of scenery. In the distance was the blue Pacific washing
the sandy shores and curving reefs of coral, and between the ocean and
the point where our friends were standing were grassed and wooded
foot-hills, and long stretches of lowlands dotted with coffee and sugar
plantations, taro-fields, and other evidences of careful cultivation, to:
gether with villages and clusters of huts that marked the dwelling-
places of the men engaged in this tropical agriculture.

" We could almost say that we had the colors of the rainbow in this
bit of landscape," said Fred, afterwards, while describing the scene.
"The blue sky and sea were tinged with purple, the distant mountains
varied in shades of blue and gray, the foothills and plains gave us every
verdant tinge that you can name, from the bright green of the mountain
grass to the dark foliage of the vegetation that surrounded the villages;
and as for yellow, you had it in every variety, from the reddish tint of
the sinuous roads to the bright and almost white belt of sand that sep-
arated land from sea. We recalled several similar views in different
parts of the world, but could give none of them preference over this.
It was the view from the Baidar Gate in the Crimea, combined with
Wockwalla near Point de Galle, and a bit of the scene from the Righi
Culm in Switzerlan ."

Whoever goes to the Hawaiian Islands will consider his visit incom~
plete unless he includes the island of Hawaii and the great volcano of
Kilauea in his tour. Doctor Bronson desired that the party should pro-
ceed thither at the earliest moment, and found on inquiry that a steam-
er was to leave for Hilo on the second morning after their arrival at
Honolulu.

"Prepare for wet weather," said his informant, "as it rains all the
time at Hilo. They say they have seventeen feet of rain there annu-
ally, and sometimes there are days and days together when it rains
without letting up a minute. Gum-coats and water-proofs are in order,
and the more you have of them the better."

Continuing, the narrator said that a Hilo man once made an experi-
ment by knocking out the heads of an oil-cask, and it mined in at the
bung-hole faster than the water could run out at the ends! Frank
asked for the documents in the case-the affidavits before the justice of
the peace, and the certificate of the resident clergyman--but they were
not forthcoming. Another story was that the fishes frequently swam
up into the air a distance of three or four hundred. yards before discov-
ering they were not in the hey, the showers being so dense that it was
impossible for them to distinguish the one from the other. Fred de--
clared himself skeptical on this subject, as the showers consisted ofFROM HONOLULU '1'0 HILO. 31

fresh water, while the bay was salt, and a salt-water fi'sh does not usu-
ally show a willingness to swim up a. fresh--water stream except in the
spawning season.

The run to I-Iilo was made in about forty hours, the steamer making
several stops on the way. It rained "ca-ts and dogs" when the party
landed, but as all the baggage had been wrapped in water-proof cover-
ings, nothing was damaged. Arrangements were speedily made for de-
parture on the following morning without regard to the weather; horses
and guides were engaged, the best animals being selected for the sad-
dles and others for packing purposes, and a substantial lunch was made

 

ready for the mid-(lay meal. Doctor Bronson insisted that the horses
should all be freshly shod before starting, and an extra supply of shoes
and nails carried along. The road goes over the lava-beds for nearly
the whole distance, and if a horse loses a shoe he will go lame in a very
few minutes, so rough and cutting is the lava.

Fortunately the morning was fine, and the bay of Hilo presented a.
pretty appearance Groves of palm and other tropical rees lined the
shore, the surf broke in regular pulsations upon the curvmg stretch of
beach, and was made animate by dozens of men and boys at play in the
waves. For the first time our friends saw some of the sport in the
water for which the islanders are famous, though less so at present than
in the days that are gone. Fred thus described it:

" Each man had a surf-board, which was a thick plank twelve or fif-
teen feet long and perhaps thirty inches Wide, and said to be made

 

sunr--nn-mmo n rum.

from the trunk of a bread-fruit tree. There were five or six of the
natives to whom we had promised half a dollar each for the perform-
ance. They pushed out with their planks to the first line of breakers
and managed to dip under it and swim along by the help of the under-
tow. They passed the second line in the same way, and finally got
beyond the entire stretch of surf into comparatively smooth water.

"Then they tossed up and down for a while, waiting for their
chance. What they wanted was an unusually high swell, and they
tried to find a place in front of it so that it would sweep them towards
the shore just where it broke into a (somber. They tried several times
but failed, and we began to get out of patience.

"At last they got what they had waited for, while some were kneel-
ing on their planks and others lying extended with their faces down-ON THE WAY TO THE VOLCANO. 33

ward, and just ahead of the great comber they swept on at a speed of
little, if any, less than forty miles an hour. There they were just ahead
of the breaker, and apparently sliding downhill; one of them was
swamped by it, but he dived and came up behind the wave and made
ready for the next. The others kept on, and were flung high and dry
by the surf, and as soon as they could rise from their planks they ran
towards us to receive their pay. One of the fellows stood erect on his
plank while in the surf, just as the Nubians at the first cataract of the
Nile stand up while descending though the foaming water. "

Meanwhile the guides Were busy getting the cavalcade' 1n readiness,
and a little before eight o 'clock the party was under way for the great
volcano. _ From Hilo to the Volcano House is a. distance of thirty
miles. The horses go for the most of the time at a walk, and though
the ride has been accomplished in six hours, it is better to allow not
less than ten for it, and " take things easily." This will give time for a
rest of an hour for lunch at the Half-way House--the lunch being the
one which we have already prepared.

 

'l'lll; VOWANO HOUSE.

Frank wanted to try the effect of a, gallop, but to guard against acci-
dents Doctor Bronson suggested that gallops would be out of order for
the day. The path over the lava is full of holes, and very rough and
broken in many places The natives trot and gallop along the road
but the novice should refiain from so doing. At a walking pace there
is little discomfort and practically no danger, and parties of ladies
and children can make the journey without excessive fatigue. " Chi va
piano va sano," as the Italians say.

The youths found the ride from Hilo to the volcano full of interest.
They amused themselves by comparing the lavarfields with those of

3
the volcanoes they had visited in other parts of the world, and they
studied the ferns, of which there were many varieties, the largest of
them having stalks three or four feet in diameter and a height of fif-
teen or twenty feet. Other ferns were very small, and between the
small and large there were all shades of colors and all possible sizes.
()ne of the guides showed that the ferns were not altogether orna
mental plants, as he plucked from one of them a woolly substance he
called pulu, and said it was used for stufling beds and pillows. Many
tons of pulu are exported every year to America and other countries. -

At the Half-way House everybody was hungry, and the lunch was
speedily disposed of. A little'after six o'clock in the evening the Vol-
cano House was reached, and here the party spent the night. A good
supper was prepared and eaten, and the incidents of the day and plans
of the morrow were discussed; then the youths joined Doctor Bron-
son, at the suggestion of the latter, in a sulphur vapor-bath of Nature's
own preparation, and after it all retired to sleep. The accommoda-
tions were limited, but everybody was weary enough to be willing to
put up with the most primitive style of lodging, provided nothing bet-
ter could be obtained.

Here is what Frank wrote concerning the visit of our friends to
the crater of the volcano:

"We took a hearty breakfast and left the house about half-past
eight o'clock in the morning, to make acquaintance with the crater.
We put on our strongest shoes but did not encumber ourselves with
heavy clothing, as the guide said we should not need it. The house
is quite near the crater, almost on its edge, and so we didn't have far
to go to begin sight-seeing; in fact, we had begun it on the previous
evening, and all through the night, as the light of the volcano was
almost constantly in our eyes. Two or three times during the night
we saw the lava Spurting up like a fountain above the edge of one of
the small craters, and altogether the scene was an exciting one.

"It is fully three miles from one side of the crater of Kilauea to the
other; but you do not walk in a straight course across it, for the simple
reason that you can't. The crater is a great pit varying from eight
hundred to fifteen hundred feet in depth; its floor consists of lava,
ashes, and broken rocks, the lava predominating. It is rough and un-
even, and in several places there are small craters sending up jets of
flame, smoke, and steam, and there are numerous cracks from which
smoke and steam issue constantly. In many places the lava lies in
great rolls and ridges that are not easy to walk over, and some ofTHE VOLCANO OF THE GODDESS PELE. 35

them are quite impassable. Consequently the path winds about a good
deal, and you may be said to walk two miles to get ahead one.

"The floor of the crater is hardly the same from week to week, and
if I shbuld make a map of it, and describe the place very carefully, you
might not know it if you come here a year from now. In many places
it is so hot that you cannot walk on it. Lava cools very slowly, and
the thicker the bed of it the longer the time it requires for cooling.

 

 

 

 

VIEW 0? ONE OF THE BURNING LAKE.

"The Hawaiians say that the volcano is under the control of the
Goddess Pele; she is a capricious deity, and you never know for any
great length of time beforehand what she will do; Whenever the mood
strikes her she orders an eruption, and straightway the fires are light-
ed, the mountain trembles, and the earth all around is violently shaken.
Flames burst forth from the crater and shoot high in air, and sometimes
the floor of the whole area is lifted and tossed like the waves of the sea.
Kilauea may be said to be constantly active, as the fires never cease; but
there are periods of great activity followed by seasons of comparative
quiet.
"Over the floor of the great crater we picked our way for nearly
three miles to the Burning Lakes; and what do you suppose these lakes
are 2

"Their name describes them, as they are literally burning lakes.--
lakes of fire so hot that if you should be foolish enough to try to bathe
in them, or so unfortunate as to fall into their waves, you would be
burned up in less than a minute. We had to climb up a steep bank of
lava to get in sight of them, and then what a spectacle was presented!

"There were two little lakes or ponds, five or six hundred feet in
diameter, and separated by a narrow embankment which the guide said
was occasionally overflowcd, and either covered entirely or broken down
for a while. These lakes are on the top of a hill formed by the cooling
of the lava, and at the time we saw them their surface was perhaps one
hundred feet below the point where we stood on the outer edge or rim.
The wind blew from us over the lakes, and carried away the greater
part of the smoke and the fumes of sulphur; but in spite of the favoring
breeze we were almost choked by the noXious gases that rose from the
burning lava, and the numerous crevices in the solid banks where we
stood. p

"I said the bank was formed by the cooling of the lava; I should
rather say by its hardening, as it was far from cool. It was so hot that
it burned our feet through the soles of our thick shoes, and we stood
first on one foot and then on the other, as turkeys are said to stand on
a hot plate. Fred sat down to rest, but he stood up again in less than
half a minute, as it was like sitting on a. hot stove. We had brought a
canteen of water which the guide placed on the ground near us; when
I went to pick it up for a drink, the air and exertion having made me
very thirsty, it was so hot that I burned my fingers in trying to hold
it. The water in the canteen was like a cup of tea as good housewives
like to pour it steaming from the kettle.

" Our faces were blistering with the heat that rose' from the surface
of the lakes, and then we scorched our hands in trying to protect our
faces. We were blinded and suffocated; we coughed and spluttered,
and found it difficult to speak, and in a. little while concluded we had
had quite enough of the lakes. We used our eyes rapidly, as there was
a great deal to look at, and the whole scene was such as does not often
come into oue's opportunities.

"The molten lava seethed, bubbled, boiled, and rolled below us, its
surface covered with a grayish and thin crust, out of which rose irreg-
ular circles and patches of fire that seemed to sweep and follow oneON THE EDGE on THE BURNING LAKE. 37

another from the circumference to the centre of the lake. Every minute
or so the lava in the centre of the lake bulged up and broke into an
enormous bubble or wave which sometimes rose twenty or thirty feet
into the air, and then broke and scattered just as you see a bubble
.breaking in a kettle of boiling paste or oatmeal porridge. I know the
comparison is a homely one, but I can't think of anything that will bet
ter describe what we saw. '

"The bank of the lake down near where the lava came against it
was red-hot, and so you may imagine if you can a mass of liquid fire
rolling and surging against a solid one. One of the lakes was much
more agitated than the other, and the liquid lava seemed to break upon
its sides very much like a sea upon a rocky shore. Owing to the half-
plastic condition of the lava, it could not break into surf and spray like
the waves of the ocean, but it made a dull roar, something like that of
the Pacific on the beach near San Francisco just after the subsidence of
a storm.

 

VIBW ON A LAVA FIELD.

" The surface of the lava changes its height from time to time. The
guide said it occasionally rose until it over-flowed the sides of the basin
enclosing the lakes, and formed streams that spread out over the level
area of the great crater. Sometimes it sank so that it was fully four
hundred feet from the edge of the rim down to the lava; but whether it
was high or low, there was never a. time when it was wholly inactive.

" The guide called our attention to cones .whieh had formed on the
rim of the lake; they were caused by the cooling of the lava around
ventrholes, and as successive jets of lava. were thrown up and cooled
they had formed cones fifteen or twenty feet high, and some of them as
much as thirty feet. When the height became so great that the lava,
sought an outlet elsewhere, it generally left afhole in the top of the
cone. We looked down some of these holes and saw the seething mass

 

HAWAIIAN WARRIORS Ol" A CENTURY AGO.

of lava threatening each moment to rise and destroy the very frail foun-
dation where we were standing. The guide said there was little real
danger, as the lava. had receded since the cones were formed. I ob-
served that the crust where we stood was not more than a foot or so in
thickness; and as the lava is very brittle, the spot was certainly not a
safe one. Besides, the fumes that rose from the vent-holes were abso-
lutely stifling; and though the sight was a. fascinating one, it was im-
possible to remein there long, owing to the difficulty of breathing.THE GREATEST VOLCANO IN THE WORLD. 39

"We have visited volcanoes in other parts of the world, but none
that equalled this, and never have we seen anything to compare with
the Burning Lakes of Kilauea. What a magnificent sight it must be
to see an eruption of Kilauea or Manna Lea--especially the latter, as
it is much the larger of the two. Just now it is quiet, but when it
does break out it is, I believe, the greatest volcano in the world. Let
me give you a few figures:

" Mauua Lea has had eight great eruptions in forty years, an aver-
age of one eruption every five years. It is 13,700 feet high, and in
several of its eruptions it has sent streams of lava fifty miles in
length to the sea. The flow of these streams is slow, usually requir-
ing eight or ten days, and sometimes longer, to cover the distance
from the mountain to the sea. In one eruption it was estimated
that 38,000,000,000 cubic feet of lava. were poured out, and in an-
other 17,000,000,000. Kilauea is properly a spur of Manna Lea, and
less than 4000 feet high, but neverthelms it is the largest constantly
active volcano in the world.

 

. CHAIN 0P EXTINC'K' \'OLCANOES, ISLAND 0" KAEAL

"When the lava from Manna Loa reaches the sea there is an im-
mense cloud of steam rising from the point where the molten mass
enters the water; the ocean is heated for miles around, and fishes
by millions perish from the heat. The ground all over the island
is devastated, earthquakes are frequent, and altogether Hawaii must

be an unpleasant place of residence at that time.
"We got back to the hotel about five o'clock in the afternoon,

thoroughly tired out with the day's exclusion, which had given us so

' \
many curious and terrible sights. It has been an experience which
we shall long remember." , '

Our friends wanted to visit the great crater of Haleakala, on the
island of Maui, in order to be able to compare an extinct volcano with
a live one, but time did not permit. They talked with a gentleman
who had been there, and that, said Fred, was the next best thing
to seeing with their own eyes. Here is the substance of what they
learned concerning Haleakala:

" You have a ride of about twelve miles to reach the summit, and
you ought to go up so as to sleep at the top and get the view at sun-
rise. There is no house there, but of this there is no need, as there are
several caves in the lava--they are really broken lava-bubbles, which
are each large enough to shelter half a dozen persons comfortably.
Of course you must have a guide and must carry plenty of blankets,
or you will suffer from the cold. Water and wood can be found near
the top of the mountain.

"The crater of Haleakala is thirty miles in circumference, or ten
miles across, and it is two thousand feet from the edge of the rim that
surrounds it to the floor of the crater; over this floor are spread ten
or twelve smaller craters and cones, some of them large enough to be
good-sized mountains by themselves, as they are nearly, if not quite,
a thousand feet high.

" You can descend into the great crater if you wish, and there is a.
path by which you can traverse it; but it is very necessary that you
should not turn from the path, as the lava. is so sharp that it would
endanger your horse's feet to go even a few yards over it. Stick to
the route, and implicitly obey your guide."

Fred obtained a map of Haleakala, which we give on the following
page. It shows the shape of the crater and the openings at either
end, where the lava is supposed to have made an outlet for itself;
these openings are called Koolau Gap and Kaupo Gap, the former be,
ing something more than two miles across, and the latter a trifle less.

Before leaving Hilo, Doctor Bronson arranged for a. schooner to
meet the party at a point on the Puna coast, which was easily reached
in a day's ride from the crater of Kilauea. Before sunset they had
paid the guide for the hire of the horses and his own wages, and the
evening saw them dashing through the waters on the way to Honolulu.
The trade-wind bore them swiftly along; Hawaii is to windward of
Oahu, and while it takes a schooner or other sailing--vessel four or five
days to heat from Honolulu to I-lilo, the return journey can be madeSUGAR CULTURE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. 41'

in from twenty-four to thirty hours. The second morning from Puna
saw the schooner anchored in the harbor of the capital, and our friends
had the satisfaction of breakfasting at the spacious and comfortable
Haw aiian hotel. _

Through the courtesy of a gentleman engaged in the sugar culture,
our friends made a visit to a. sugar plantation, the culture of the sac-
charine product being the principal industry of the Hawaiian Islands.
We have not space for an account of all they saw and heard, but will
give a summary from Fred's note-book.

 

MAP 0? 1113 )JALBAKALA CRATKFL

" Sugar is grown on all the four large islands of the group, but the
principal seat of the industry is on Maui, which seems 'peculiarly fa-
vorable to it. We were told that the yield was sometimes between
five and six tons to the acre, four tons was not an unusual amount,
and it would be considered a poor plantation that did not give two
or two and a half tons. The volcanic soil seems to be just what the

- sugar-cane loves; the seasons are such that planting can be done in
many places at any time of the year, and there is not the least

danger of frost, as in the sugar area of the United States.
"The common custom is to raise two crops, and then let the ground

lie idle for two seasons; so that taking a series of years together, allow-
ance must be made for the idle time in estimating the yield of sugar.
In some localities, especially those where the ground is artificially irri-
gated, this plan is not always followed, as it does not appear to be'
necessary. To show the growth of the industry, let me say that the
export of sugar in 1860 was 1,414,271 pounds, while in 1871, eleven
years later, it was 21,760,773 pounds. Last year it was in the neigh-
borhood of fifty million pounds.
"In the early years of the
sugar culture the work was per-
formed by the natives, but in
course of time it grew to such an
extent that the local supply of la.-
bor was not sufficient. A great
number of Chinese and Portuguese
were introduced, and laborers have
been brought from other islands of

the Pacific Ocean, so that the pop-
ulation of the country is now a

mixed one. By the census of 1878
the population was 57,985; 44,088
of these were natives, 5916 Chi-
nese, 4561 whites, and 3420 half--
castes. In'1882 the population
was estimated at 66,895, including
212,804 Chinese. In the two years
mnmunmu 1., FIRST ruse or run summon ending MarCh 31' 1884' there was
mm" an immigration of 6166 Portuguese
from the Azores Islands. Among
the whites the Americans'are most numerous, but the Germans are
steadily increasing in numbers, a large part of the sugar interest and
the commerce dependent upon it being in their hands. The commer>>
cial king of the islands is Claus Spreckels, who is of German origin,
and practically controls the sugar culture. He owns a steamship line
between Honolulu and San Francisco, and the local steamers plying to
the various islands are mostly in his hands.
"Rice and coffee are also products of the islands, but they occupy
a low position when compared to that of sugar. Hides, tallow, wool,
and salt are also exported, but the quantity is not great. The value
of the exports of the islands is from eight to ten million dollars an-
nually, and the imports amount to about two millions less than the
exports. The principal imports are textile fabrics, clothing, implements,
machinery, and provisions."VISITING THE LEPER ISLAND. 43-

So much for the commercial condition of the kingdom of Hawaii.
Let us now turn to other matters.

Our friends took a day, or rather two nights and a day, for a visit
to the famous Leper Hospital on Molokai Island. Leaving Honolulu
late one evening, they were landed the next morning on Molokai for
their strange excursion. We Will let Frank tell the story of the visit.

- " The leper settlement is on a plain, which is surrounded by mount--
ains on three sides and the sea. on the fourth. The mountains are so
rugged as to be impassable except at a few points, which are always
carefully guarded: The sea-front is also watched, so that escape from

the settlement is practically impossible.
"Any person in the Hawaiian kingdom suspected of leprosy is
arrested by the authorities, and if a. medical examination shows that
he is afflicted with the disease he is sent to Molokai. The sentence is

near Honolulu where all doubtful cases are sent, and the physician in
charge keeps them there until the certainty of the presence or absence
of the disease is settled beyond question.

"The doctor who accompanied us through the settlement assured
us that leprosy is neither epidemic nor contagious in the ordinary sense '
of the latter word. It can only be communicated by an abraded sur-
face coming in contact with a leprous sore; and he said that the prac-
tice among the natives of many persons smoking the same pipe had
done much to spread the disease. He shook hands freely with the
victims of leprosy during our visit, and did not take the trouble to
wear gloves, even when the hands of the others were covered with
sores. -

" He told us that the disease first showed itself by a slight swelling
under the eyes and in-the lobes of the ears; then the fingers contracted
like birds' claws, the face swelled into ridges that were smooth and
shiny, and later these ridges broke into festering sores. Sometimes
these symptoms on the face do not appear, the attacks being principally
on the hands and feet. The fingers and toes wither and decay; they
seem to dry up and shrink, as we saw several persons whose finger-
nails were on their knuckles, the fingers having shrunk away and dis-
appeared. .

"It is a curious circumstance that the victims of leprosy rarely
suffer pain. The decay of the extremities is gradual, and the shiny
ridges on the face may be pinched
with the fingers or punctured with
a pin without giving any sensation.
Among the nine hundred and odd
persons in the leper settlement we
saw very'few sad faces. The people
were enjoying themselves very much
as they would in Honolulu--talking
and laughing, walking or lounging
about, or riding horses, and in one -
place they were playing a game that, liAWAHAh' ms.

evoked a good deal of shouting and
hilarity. Many were at work in the fields and gardens, or making

salt along the shore. There is a leper governor for the settlement, and
the usual number of subordinates that such a place requires. There
is a store where goods are sold at cost, and many of the lepers re-
ceive money from theirjriends and spend it at the store. The Gov-
ernment provides the lepers with clothes and lodging, and gives them
sufficient food for their subsistence. Those who can work are encour-
aged to do so, and all that they produce is bought by the Board of
Health and paid for out of the store.

"Then they have two churches--~one Catholic and the other Prot-
estant. The latter has a native pastor, and the former a White priest,
who has volunteered to seclude himself among these unfortunate people
for their religious good. There are three white men and eight Chinese
wholhave been sent here as lepers. It has been charged that the Chi-
nese brought leprosy to the islands, but the doctor says this is not so,
the disease having existed here before the Chinese came; and besides,
it is quite unlike the malady of that name in China. There it princi-
pally attacks the skin, while the Hawaiian form belongs to the blood.

"The location of the settlement is an excellent one, as it is on the
windward side of the island, and constantly swept by the pure breezes
from the ocean. For those who are unable to move about there are
large and well-kept hospitals, where the patients are waited upon by
other lepers that have not reached the disabled stage.' Access and
escape are alike difficult, and everything seems to have been done to
make life as comfortable as possible to the unfortunate victims who
are sent here."THE vouen RESUMED. 4'7

I'IIOSE who have followed the Boy Travellers in their journeys in

other parts of the world will remember that their plans were often
changed by circumstances which could not be foreseen. At Honolulu
one of these changes took place, and this is how it happened:

When the Alameda entered the harbor on her arrival from San
Francisco our friends observed at anchor at trim-looking yacht display-
ing the English flag. They were too busy with the novelties of the
place to give her any attention, and her presence was soon forgotten.

0n the morning of their return from Molokai Doctor Bronson en-
countered in the breakfast-room of the hotel an old friend, Doctor
Maealister, of Cambridge, England. Their greetings were cordial, and
all the more so as neither had the least idea that the other was inthe
'Hawaiian Islands or anywhere else in the Pacific Ocean. In almost the
same breath each exclaimed,

"What are you doing here 2"

Doctor Bronson explained briefly how he came to Honolulu, and
where he was going, to which Doctor Macalister responded,

" I came here on the yacht Pam; she belongs to Colonel Bush, for--
merly of her Britannic Majesty's army, but for seVeral years in the
service of the Turkish Government. I am the colonel's guest, and we
came here by way of India, China, and Japan. We leave tomorrow
for the South Pacific, where we are to cruise about for several months,
visiting the most interesting of the island groups. We go first to the
Marquesas Islands, and then--"
 

LDOXING SEAWARD.

Just at this moment Colonel Bush entered the breakfast-room, and
was introduced to Doctor Bronson. A moment later Frank and Fred
arrived, presentations followed, and before the morning meal was over
the American contingent was fairly well acquainted with the English
one.

Conversation developed the fact that two gentlemen who had ar-
rived on the Pew had left by the mail-steamer for San Francisco,
having received letters at Honolulu which compelled their immediate
retiu'n to England. Consequently the Pam's party was reduced to
Colonel Bush and Doctor Macalister.

The party arranged to meet at dinner. Colonel Bush and Doctor
Macalister went to the Para, while Doctor Bronson and the youths pro-
ceeded to make farewell calls, as the steamer on which they were to
continue their journey was due on the mom-ow, and they wished to be
ready for her.

Exactly how it came about we are unable to say, but it is evident
that Colonel Bush desired further acquaintance with Doctor Bronson
and his nephews, and that Doctor Macalister had heartily approved the
colonel's desire. At all events, when the three gentlemen were together
after dinner, Frank and Fred having left the table, the colonel invited
Doctor Bronson, with his nephews, to accompany him in his voyage
to the South Seas.PLANS FOR A LONG VOYAGE. ' - 49

" There is plenty of room on
the yacht," said he, " and pro-
visions are abundant. The Peru

IJea/m, the famous yacht of Sir
Thomas Brassey, of which you

us down to the equatorial belt

straight to the Marquesas. From

wherever she goes. Beyond
Feejee I have not formed my
plans very definitely, as they
will depend somewhat upon
the letters I receive there,
and upon the state of things
in the New Hebrides, the
Solomon Islands, and other
of the groups to the west of
Feejee."

The heartiness of the in-
vitation, the opportunity the
voyage would give for seeing
groups of islands not on the-
regular track of travel, and the
fact that he was not pressed
for time, settled the question
with Doctor Bronson, and he
accepted at once. He ex-
cused himself shortly afterwards to inform the youths of the change in
their plans. . _

Of course they were delighted at the opportunity of making an ac-
quaintance with the islands that were included in the Pem's proposed
voyage, and earnestly congratulated themselves on their good-fortune.

The baggage of the party was sent on board in the forenoon of the
next day; the travellers followed it, and a. little before two o'clock in
the afternoon the Pam steamed out of Honolulu and headed southward.
When she had made a. good ofling her engines were stopped, the fires
were put out, and the yacht proceeded at a. splendid pace with the
strong trade-wind on her port beam. Her course was directed to the
south-east, so as to enable her to cross the equator about longitude 140deg
west, and take advantage of the southeast trades in making the Mar-
quesas.

Frank undertook a. journal of the voyage; but like most works of
the kind, it abounded in repetitions, and our space will not permit ex-LIFE AT SEA IN THE TROPICS. 51'

tensive quotations. One day was so much like another that the young
gentleman admitted that his narrative would make very tiresome read-
ing, and he doubted if any one would care to peruse it. Suffice it to say
the time passed agreeably, as there was a good library on board, and
each member of the party tried to do his share towards entertaining
the rest. Stories of sea and land, "of moving accidents by flood and
field," and discussions upon scientific, social, and all other imaginable
topics, served to beguile the hours and shorten the distance between the
Hawaiian and the Marquesas gioups

The north-east trades carried the Para almost to the equator, then
came a period of calm in a torrid temperature that drove eve1ybody to
the shelter of the double awning over the deck, and made them sigh for
cooler latitudes. Heavy clothing was at a discount, and the lightest
garments were found more than sufficient. Social rules were suspended,
and pajamas were worn altogether, except at dinner-time, when light
suits of linen took their place. Dinner was served on deck beneath the
awning, and the ice-machine was kept in constant action to supply ice
for the use of the sweltering travellers. Happily this state of affairs

did not last long; as soon as the Para entered the calm belt the funnel
was hoisted, fires were started, the equator was crossed triumphantly,
and the yacht in due time caught the south-east trades, and was once

more turned into a sailing- -craft
As they left the equator behind them the north star disappeared
below the horizon, and the Southern Cross, that magnificent constella-
tion of the antarctic heavens, came into view. Frank regretted that
they could not look at it with a powerful telescope, when he learned
from the captain of the Para that there is a brilliant cluster of stars in
the centre of the Cross, invisible to the unassisted eye, and only revealed
by a strong glass. Farther south their attention was absorbed by the
Magellan clouds, two nebulae of stars so densely packed together and
so far away that they resemble light fleeey clouds more than any-
thing else.

In a direct line it is about two thousand miles from Honolulu to
the outermost of the Marquesas group. The log of the Pera showed
a run of 2180 miles, and on the morning of the sixteenth day of the
voyage the lookout gave the welcome announcement that land was in
sight. Colonel Bush had given directions for the. yacht to proceed
direct to N ookaheeva Bay, the best harbor in the Marquesas group, and
consequently the travellers contented themselves with distant views of
the outer islands that lay in their course. The islands are evidently
of volcanic origin, as they present high peaks rising two or three thou-
sand feet, and in some places their sides are almost precipitous. With
a glass, or even with the unaided eye, it was easy to perceive that the
sides of the mountains and the valleys enclosed between them were
thickly clothed -Wltll_' tropical trees and undergrowth, that extended
down close to the water's edge.

Frank made the following historical note concerning the islands:

"They were discovered in 1595 by a Spanish navigator, Mendafia
de Neyra, who named them Las Marquesas do Mendoza, in honor of
the Marquis de Mendoza, Viceroy of Peru. They are sometimes known
as the Mendafia Archipelago, in honor of their discoverer; and they are
also called the Washington Islands, having been so named by Captain
Ingraham of the American ship Hope, who visited them in 1791. They
are generally divided into two groups, the Northern and Southern, and
the Island of Nookaheeva, whe1e we are going, is in the Northern group.
Altogether there are thirteen of the islands, with an men, of less than
five hundred square miles and a population of about ten thousand.

"Properly the name Marquesas belongs to the Southern group only,
as they alone were visited by Mendana; the Northern grOup 'Was not
known until the American captain discovei ed it, and therefore We shall
insist that they am the Washington Islands."

For the description of what they saw at Nookaheeva we will 1er
upon Fred's account.ARRIVAL AT NOOKAHEEVA. 53

V "As we neared the island," said the youth in his journal, "we got
up steam and went proudly into therharbor, which has a very good
anchorage. The French flag was flying from a, tall staff at the end of
the bay, and you must know that. the islands are under a. French protect
orate, and have been so since 1841. Hardly was our anchor down be-
fore the yacht was surroxmded by a. dozen boats, or canoes; one of them
contained a Frenchman in a. greatly faded uniform, who said he was the
captain of the port. I very much doubt if he ever held the rank of cap-
tain anywhere else.

" However, he represented the authority of the French Government
and treated us politely. Evidently the port was not often visited by
pleasure craft like our own, as he seemed somewhat surprised when told

that we had nothing to sell, and did not wish to buy anything except-
4*
.fresh provisions. We bought some yams, bread-fruit, bananas, and other

fruits and vegetables, together with two or three pigs that the natives
'brought alongside in their boats. The captain of the port promised to
send us a man who would supply us with fresh beef, and then went on
shore, whither we followed as soon as we had lunched.

" Both in the boats and on the land we had a good opportunity to
study the natives, who are said to be the finest type of I'olynesians.
They belong to the Malay race, and are distinguished for their graceful
and symmetrical figures; the men are tall and well- proportioned, with
skins of a dark copper color, while the women are considerably lighter
in complexion, partly in consequence of their being less exposed to the
sun, and partly because of certain pigments which they apply to their
faces and arms.

"Tattooing is in fashion here; it prevails among both sexes, though
more among the men than the women. It takes along time to perform
it thoroughly. A resident Frenchman with whom we talked on the
subject said that the operation began at the age of nineteen or twenty,
and was rarely finished until the subject was approaching his fortieth
year. It is performed with an instrument shaped like a comb, or rather
like a small chisel with its end fashioned into teeth. The figure is
drawn upon the skin, and then the artist dips the comb into ,an ink
made of burnt cocoanut~she11 and water, until the blunt ends of the
teeth have taken up some of the coloring matter. Then the comb is
placed on the proper spot, and with a, mallet is driven through the skin,
eliciting a howl from the subject, unless he is of stoical mood.

" Only a few square inches can be operated on at a time. The flesh
swells and becomes very sore, and the performance cannot be repeated
until the swelling subsides and the patient has gathered strength and
recovered from the fever into which he is generally thrown. We are
told that the custom is far less prevalent than when the islands were
first discovered, and it will probably die out in another generation or
two.

"The marks made by tattooing are permanent, and no application
has ever been found that will remove them. We have seen several men
whose entire bodies were tattooed, others whose arms and faces had
alone been wrought upon, and others again who had kept their faces
free from marks but had their bodies covered. One old fellow con-
sented to stand for his photograph in consideration of being rewarded
with a hatchet and some fish-hooks, which we willingly gave him. We.
added a pocket-knife, which he received with a grunt of satisfaction, butTATTOOING IN THE MARQUESAS. ' 55.

without deigning to say 'Thank you,' or anything like its equivalent.
He said his name was Gattanewa, and that he was grandson of a. former

chief of that name.
"The faces of the women are not tattooed, except that now and

then they have a. black line on the upper lip, which is quite suggestive
of a. budding mustache. One pretty woman was pointed out to us who
was said to 'be the daughter of a chief; her hands and airms were tat-
tooed, the tattooing on the arms extending nearly to the elbow. At a.
little distance she seemed to have on a. pair of embroidered gloves, and
this fact suggested an idea. Why could not the ladies of civilized lands
have their hands tattooed in imitation of gloves, and thus save them-
selves the trouble and expense of donning a new pair so often? An
ingenious artist could do it nicely, and he might even tattoo the buttons
in their places, so that the gloves could have no possible chance of slip
ping off or getting out of shape.

 

GATTASBWA'S Pommn.

"There was a chief of one of the interior tribes who presented an
excellent specimen of the work of the Polynesian artist on a living can-
vas. Circles, squares, and all sorts of curious figures had been delin-
eated on his skin, and then punctured in with the tattoo instrument;
and the artist certainly possessed a correct eye, as all the drawing was
mathematically exact. The chief allowed Frank to make a sketch ofPREVALENCE OF TATTOOING CUSTOMS. 57

him', as the photograph did not bring out all the lines with distinct>>-
ness; of course he was rewarded for his condescension, and as he re--
ceived twice as much as he had expected, we had any number of candi-

dates offering themselves when it was known how liberally we paid for
services.

 

TA'I'NJO MARKS~0N A CHIEF 01' THE "HOURS/AS.

"Doctor Bronson says the custom prevails in many of the islands
of Polynesia, though not in all, but is fast dying out through the influ-
ence of Christianity and civilization. Tattooing has been practised in
almost all parts of the world and in all ages. According to the Bible, it
must have existed in the time of Moses, for we find it to be one of the
practices prohibited to the J ews; Read what is said in Leviticus, xix.
28: 'Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print
any marks upon you.' It prevailed among the ancient Thracians, and
the ancient 'Britonsj practised it. ~ It still exists among sailors, and has
probablydescended through them from the time when it was common-
in Great Britain, though they may have adopted it from the barbarous-
countries to which their occupation carries them. -

"Frank says these people are like a French salad, as they are dressed:
with oil; they use cocoanutroil for polishing their skins and anointing
their hair, and it is applied with great liberality. One of the presents
we gave to the chief who stood for his picture was a flat bottle like a.
pocket--flask; he said through the interpreter that it was just the thing
for carrying oil, and he will no doubt use it for that purpose until it
goes the way of all bottles and is broken. The effect on the skin is less
disagreeable than you might suppose, as it makes it shine like a. piece of
mahogany, and brings out the tattoo marks just as varnishing a picture
brings out its strong points more clearly than before.

"Turmeric and other coloring substances are used with the oil. Tur-
meric gives a reddish tinge to the natural brown, and when it is applied
to the skin of a pretty woman the eflect is like that of the tint of an
American belle who has spent a summer at the sea-side or on a. yacht-
ing cruise, and has not been careful of her complexion. Here is a hint
for the ladies who pretend to go to the seaside or the mountains in
summer, but are really obliged to remain at home: Make a. cosmetic of
cocoanut-butter and turmeric, and apply it in place of cold-cream night
and morning. In this way you can get up a ' seaside tan' at a trifling
expense.

"Before civilization came here the natives wore very little clothing,
and even at the present time they do not spend much money on their
wardrobes. The native cloth, tappa, is made by pounding the inner
bark of a species of mulberry-tree with a mallet after soaking it in
water. Tappn enough for an entire dress can 'be made in a day, and
when it is done it will last five or six weeks. For a head-dress it is
made of a more open texture than for garments to cover the body.
The women wrap three or four yards of it around the waist to form a
skirt or petticoat, and then cover their shoulders with a mantle of the
same material. European cotton goods have partially replaced tappa,
and the old industry is dying out. It is a pity, too, as tappa is prettier
than cotton cloth, and the natives look better in it than in more civ-
ilized material.

"In another way civilization has destroyed the picturesqueness of
the Marquesas Islands. The natives formerly wore necklaces made of
hogs' and whales' teeth, and the men bored their ears, in which theyHOW THE FRENCH TOOK THE MARQUESAS. 59

inserted ornaments of bone or teeth. These snow-white necklaces on
the skins of the Marquesas women had a. very pretty effect, much pretr
tier than that of the cheap jewellery they wear nowadays, and. which
comes from French or English manufactories. The chief's daughter
whom I mentioned had one of these necklaces, but she wore it more as
the mark of her rank than because she admired'it. Above the necklace
she had a. double string of common beads. She had a. funny sort of ear-
omament that we tried in vain to buy, as it was one of the insignia to
indicate her rank in life.

"When the French took possession of the islands they started to
make an extensive colony. They sent a. fleet of four ships of war with
five hundred troops, and hoisted the French flag with a. great deal of
ceremony. Fortifications were built, and there were some conflicts with
the natives; but of course the islanders, with their rude and primitive
weapons, were speedily conquered. The French built docks and jetties
in addition to their fortifications, but they have been of little practical
use. We found that the most of the jetties had rotted away, and in
place of the former garrison of five hundred men there are now about
sixty soldiers and a few policemen.

"The Governor treated us very kindly, and at our first call upon
him he invited us to dine with him, where we met his amiable wife and
the officers of his staff. Colonel Bush invited them to dine on the
yacht. As the cabin is limited, we had the Governor and his wife on
one day and the officers on another, and I am sure they all enjoyed
our visit. Strangers come here so rarely that our advent made an
agreeable break in the monotony of their lives.

" There are some fifty foreigners living here, and they include several
nationalities--English, American, Irish, Scotch, French, German, Portu-
guese, Spanish, and Peruvian. Some of them are engaged in business,
but there is not a great deal of it, as the colony has not been successful.
Cotton is the principal article of cultivation, and there is a small trade
in beche--de-mer, the famous seacucumber of which the Chinese are fond.
It brings a high price in the markets of Canton and Shanghai, some-
times selling as high as five hundred dollars a ton. One of the English-
men, who has a store in the little settlement, said that several of the cot
ton plantations had been abandoned, owing to the difficulty of getting
laborers for them. The natives are disinclined to work, and laborers
from other islands cannot be had in sufficient numbers. Several hun-
dred Chinese have been imported, and also some laborers from the Gil-
bert and Loyalty Islands. The Chinese make very good colonists, and
many of them have plantations of their own, which they manage very
successfully. _

"The same gentleman showed us a fungus that comes from the
valleys between the mountains; it looks very much like a scrap of
dried leather, and would not be considered worth much to one who
(lid not know about it. It brings a good price in China, where it is
used for making soup. We tried some of it at dinner one day, and
found it not at all disagreeable to the taste; in fact it was so good
that our steward bought nearly a barrel of it for future use.

"There is a road around the head of the bay which was built by
the French soon after their arrival, but has been neglected and is not
in good repair. Our host took us on a ride along this road, from
which the view is delightful. In front is the deep blue water of theCURIOUS FORMATION OF ISLANDS. ' 61

bay, while behind us the mountains rose very precipitously, and seem-
ed to shut us out altogether fmm the rest of the island. The bay is
nearly in the shape of a horseshoe, ending in two high headlands, and
to follow its shores requires a walk or ride of about nine miles. The
entrance is less than half a mile wide, and is guarded by two small
islands, each about five hundred feet high.

" Cowper says:
l"litliouutnins lnterpos'd
Make enemies of nations who had else,
Like kindred drops, been mingled into one.'

" There is nowhere in the world a better illustration of the truth
of this assertion than in the Marquesas. In each island the mountains .,
rise in ridges like the sections of a starfish; some of these ridges are
quite impassable, and all of them very difficult to traverse. The re-
sult has been that there was formerly very little intercourse between
the tribes occupying the different valleys, and until the French came
here there was hardly a time when two or more tribes were not at war.

 

A EUROPEAN'B RESIDENCE [N m HARQVSSAS.

Even at present they are not entirely at peace, and though the most
of them have abandoned cannibalism, it is occasionally practised.
"Our host told us that in many of the valleys there are old men
who have never been outside the limits of the mountain walls that
enclose their homes, and others whose journeys have been wholly
confined to short excursions on the water a few miles from shore.
The ordinary mode of communication is by water, and in many cases
it is the only one possible.

"The gentleman invited us to go to one of the valleys where he has
a. plantation; we made the excursion in a large sail-boat manned by
six or eight natives, but built. after an English model and commanded
by an English sailor. Starting early one morning, we made the run
in about four hours, spent an afternoon and night in the valley, and
returned the next day. All these valleys in the Marquesas have a

, wealth of tropical trees and smaller plants which is not surpassed any-
where else in the world. The cocoa and several other varieties of the
palm-tree abound here, and they have the bread-fruit, the banana and
taro plants, the sugar-cane, and, as before mentioned, the cotton-plant.

"Close by the landing-place we came to a village of a dozen or
twenty huts built of the yellow bamboo and thatched with palmetto
leaves, which the sun had bleached to a whiteness that reminded us of
a newly shingled roof in temperate zones. Our guide called our atten-
tion to the platform of stones on which each house stood, and said it
was a protection against dampness. The rain falls frequently and
very heavily, and it is the abundant moisture that makes the vegetar
tion so luxuriant. 0n the mountain ridges, in whatever direction you
look, there are streams tumbling down, and the steep cliifs are whit-
ened by numerous cascades. The moisture nourishes a great variety
of creeping plants, and in many places they completely cover the pre-
cipitous cliffs and give them the appearance of green water-falls. '

" The natives in one respect resemble the :Irish peasantry, their
chief wealth being in pigs. These animals were introduced by the '
Spaniards, who were for a long time venerated as gods in consequence
of this inestimable gift to these simple-minded people. Before the
visit of the Spaniards the islands had absolutely no four-footed ani-
mals; hence it is easy to see how Meudafia and his companions were
regarded as more than human.

" Now they have some horses and horned cattle, but not many;
they have dogs and cats, and unfortunately they'have rats, which were
brought here in foreign ships, and have multiplied so fast that they
have become a great pest. There are only a few varieties of birds on
the islands; most of them have beautiful plumage, but none can be
properly called song-birds.63

HOMES OI' THE PEOPLE

"Near the village is a well-built church of stone; it is in charge
of a Catholic priest, and we were told that there is an average of one
church to every two hundred inhabitants all over the islands. The
first missionaries to the Marquesas came in the London Mission ship
Def near the end of the last century, but after
a. short residence they became disheartened and
abandoned the effort to convert and civilize the
people. Several attempts were made in the first
quarter of the present century, but with a simi-
lar result. In 1833 some American missionaries
tried the experiment, and in 1834 the London
Mission Society sent a fresh party of missiona-
ries, but all to little purpose.

 

,' "In 1853 an English missionary named Bick-
- nell and four Hawaiian teachers, accompanied by .
"mom "mom". their wives, went to the Marquesas at the re-

quest of a. Marquesan chief, who had gone to
the Sandwich Islands in a whale-ship to present the invitation. The
French priests opposed the coming of these missionaries, but the chiefs
refused to give them up, and so the teachers remained, but they made
little progress in converting the natives to Christianity.

"The Catholic mission supports quite a number of priests and a
bishop at the Marquesas. The mission has had very poor success in
securing adherents to its faith, but it has done much good in the way
of showing the natives the result of industry. Around each mission
station there is a well-cultivated garden, and seine of the finest cotton-
fields on the islands may be found there. I have never seen anywhere
at prettier cotton-field than at the mission we visited. ,

"There is a convent at N ookaheeva, where the French Sisters are
educating about sixty Marquesan girls, whose ages vary from four to
sixteen years. There is a. similar school for boys, which is under the
charge of the mission; and the bishop hopes that these boys and girls
will be of service in educating and converting their people to the relig-
ion and civilization of the foreigner. But from all we can learn it will
be a long time before his hopes are realized. The Queen is a devout
Catholic, while the King is a nominal one, and each missionary has a
small flock of followers; but the great majority are as much heathen as
ever, and cling firmly to their old superstitions.

" One of the curious customs of the South Sea Islands is the tabu,
and it prevails much more strongly at the Marquesas at the present timeTHE TABU AND ITS PECULIARI'I'IES. 65

than anywhere else. The word is Polynesian, and singularly resem-
bles in sound and meaning the to dial). of the ancient Hebrews. It
has a good and a bad meaning, or rather it may apply to a sacred thing
or to a wicked one. A cemetery, being consecrated ground, would be
tabu, or sacred, and to fight there would be tabu, or wicked. Our Eng-
lish word ' tabooed ' (forbidden) comes from the Polynesian one.

"It would take too long to describe all the operations of tabu as it
formerly prevailed through Polynesia and still exists in some of the
islands, and especially in the Marquesas. There were two kinds of tabu,
one of them permanent, the other temporary. The permanent tabu
was a sort of traditional or social rule, and applied to everybody. All
grounds and buildings dedicated to any idol or god were tabu, and

therefore became places of refuge to men fleeing from an enemy, ex-
actly like the Cities of Refuge mentioned in the Bible. It was tabu to
touch the person of a chief or any article belonging to him, or eat any-
thing he had touched. In the Tonga Islands it was tabu to speak the
name of father or mother or of father-in--law or mother-in-law, to touch
them, or to eat in their presence except with the back turned, when they
.were constructively supposed to be absent.

"In the Fecjee Islands it was tabu for brother and sister and first-
cousins to speak together or eat from the same dish. Husband and
wife could not eat from the same dish, and a, father could not speak
to his son if the latter was more than fifteen years old!

"The tabu was a. very convenient police system, as any exposed
property could be made safe by being tabooed. The chiefs and priests
could tszu anything they chose; when a feast was about to come offORIGIN OF THE MERMAID MYTH. 67

-the chief would previously tabu certain articles of food, and thus insure
an abundance on the day of the festival. Violation of certain kinds of
tabu was punished with death; other and smaller violations had various
penalties efiixed,a11d they generally included sacrifices or presents to
the gods, or the payment of fines to the chiefs.

" Well, here in the Marquesas, among other prohibitions, it was tabu
for a woman to enter a. canoe or boat. Men had a monopoly of all pad--
dling and sailing, and the only sea-voyage a woman could make was by
swimming. I have read about women in the South Seas swimming out
to ships anchored a long distance from shore, and never understood till
now how it was. It is no wonder that sailors used to mistake these
Marquesan nymphs for mermaids as they dashed through the waves
with their long black hair trailing behind them in the water."

F1 ed's account of what they saw in the Marquesas pauses abruptly
at this point. Perhaps he was interrupted by just such a scene as he
describes 1n the last sentence, but he could haldly fall into the old error
of the sailors. The women of the Marquesas am fine swimmers, but no
better, perhaps, than those of the Feejee, Samoan, and other tropical or

semi-tropical groups.
The Para remained several days at the Marquesas, and then pro-
ceeded to Tahiti, in the Society group. Before they left Nookaheeva
one of the officers of the Governor's staff pointed out the hill where

Commodore Porter hoisted the
American flag when he anchored
with his prizes in the bay during
the war of 1812. "That was a
long time ago," said the officer;
"but the incident is vividly pre-
served in the traditions of the
people. And it was that incident
that greatly aided the French in
getting their foothold here."

"How was that?" Frank in-
quired.

"At the time of Commodore
Porter's visit," replied the officer,
"the Nookaheevans were at war
with a neighboring tribe. The
hostile tribe made an incursion
one night and destroyed about
two hundred bread--fruit trees
close to Porter's camp; the next
day they sent a messenger to tell
him he was a, coward, and they
would come soon and attack his
camp.

"Porter thereupon concluded
to teach them a. lesson, and so
he sent a. small detachment un-
der Lieutenant Downs to aid the
Nookaheevans to punish their
enemies

"This was accomplished, and
the hostile tribe was completely
subdued. As soon as he had
completed the repairs to his ships

Porter sailed away, but he was long revered in Nooka-heeva. When
the French came here, thirty years afterwards, the natives thought the
performance of Porter would be repeated, and the Frenchmen wouldTHE murmurs or THE BOUNTY. 69

aid the Nookaheevans to defeat their enemies. They we're received
with open arms, and the natives were not undeceived until the French
had completed their forts and were fully able to defend themselves."

Continuing his reference to the natives, Frank's informant said that
great numbers of them were at one time kidnapped and carried away
by labor-vessels, of which more will be said in a later chapter. In 1863
Small-pox was introduced by foreign ships, and killed nearly' one-half of
the population. Altogether the people of the Marquesas have no special
occasion to be grateful to
the white man.

During the Pam's voy-
age to Tahiti our young
friends devoted their time
to a study of that part of
the Pacific Ocean and the
islands it contained. Fred
called their attention to
Ifitcairn Island, which has
been long famous as the
home of the mutineers of
the Bounty; both the
youths regretted that
they were not to pass in
its vicinity, but consoled
themselves by reading an
account of a visit to it,
and. a description of the

 

inhabitants.*
One day, while they
were busy with their "m"s'w" ""-

studies of the Pacific,
Doctor Bronson called their attention to Easter Island, which he pro-
nounced one of the most remarkable islands in the great ocean.

Frank eagerly asked why it'was so, and the Doctor kindly explained
as follows:

"It is remarkable," said he, "on account of the mysterious origin
and'history of its former inhabitants, and the sculptured rocks and

stone images which they have left scattered in great numbers over the
island. It has been known since 1722, when the navigator Roggewein
discovered it on Easter Sunday of that year, and named it Easter Island
in commemoration of the discovery. Some authorities say it was dis--
covered in 1686 by Davis, an English buccaneer, and it was known as
Davis Land until Rogge-
wein's visit. Captain Cook
visited it about 1772, and it
is said he found twenty thou-
sand inhabitants there. The
island is about thirty miles,
in circumference, and is sit-
uated in latitude 27deg 10'
south, and 109deg 26' west lon-
gitude. It has a remarkable
isolation, being two thou-
sand miles from the coast
of Chili, and one thousand
five hundred from any other
inhabited island except Pit--
cairn, and that, as you know,
is a small island, about two
miles long and not more
than a mile broad in its
widest part.

"Easter Island is called
Rape. Nui by the natives of
Tahiti, and is of unmistaka-
bly volcanic origin. There

EASTER isuxn wows, is a. large extinct crater on

- each end of the island, and

numerous small ones between, the ground being thickly covered with
black volcanic rock and obsidian in the western portion. The largest
of these volcanoes is named Rauo Kao ; it is over one thousand three
hundred feet high, enclosing a fresh-water lake nearly three miles in
circumference, the surface of which is partially covered with vegetable
matter, over which a man may walk in places. The second one in size
is extremely interesting on account of its being the place where the
stone images were made from lava rock, a great number of which still
remain, some unfinished and attached to the precipitous cliffs. AnWONDERS 0F EASTER ISLAND.

enormous number of these im-
ages is scattered all over the
island, while there are ninety-
three inside and one hundred
and fifty-five ilmnediately out-
side of the crater. They are in
solid pieces, varying from five
to seventy feet in height; some
of the figures lying prostrate
are twentyseven feet long, and
measure eight feet across the
breast." '

"Very much like the great
statues at Thebes and Karnak
in Egypt," said Fred.

"Yes," replied the Doctor,
" and one of these statues meas-
ures twenty feet from the shoul-

der to the crown of the head,

The sculpture is extremely rude,
and as works of art the Easter
Island statues bear no compari~
son to the Egyptian ones. The
human body is represented ter-
minating at the hips, the head
is flat, the top of the forehead
out level so as to support a
crown which was cut from red
tufa found in one of the smaller
craters. They were transported
to villages near the sea, and
placed upon stone platforms
constructed in various heights
and different lengths, facing the
water. One of these platforms
supported thirteen immense im-
ages, and all of those examined
contained human bones, show-
ing it to be a place of burial.

sea. is a village of ancient stone huts, where, it is said, the natives lived

only during a portion 'of the year. Near by are also sculptured rocks,
' covered with curious and extremely interesting carvings.

" The platforms are from two to three hundred feet long, and about
thirty feet high, built of hewn stones five or six feet long, and accurate-
ly joined Without cement. The platforms are at intervals all around
the coast, and some of the headlands were levelled 01f to form similar
resting-places for the images.

 

 

STONE PLATFORM FOR lXAGES.

" All of the principal images have the top of the head cut flat and
crowned with a. circular mass of red. lava. hewn perfectly round; seine
of these crowns are sixty-six inches in diameter, and fifty-two inches
thick, and were brought eight miles from the spot Where they were
quarried. About thirty crowns are lying in the quarries, and some of
them are fully ten feet in diameter, and of proportionate height."

Frank asked if the present inhabitants had any tradition concerning
these statues. '

"None whatever," was the reply. "At present there are less than
two hundred people living there; they seem to be the degenerate re-INHABITANTS or EASTER ISLAND. 73

mains of a. race something like the Maoris of New Zealand, and they
speak it language similar to those people. Although undoubtedly a can-
nibal race--in fact, one old man speaks with enthusiasm when asked
regarding the custom--they are at present quiet and enlightened, but
retain many superstitious ideas which they have received by transmis-
sion. They venerate a small searbird, the egg of which is sacred to '
them, and their season of feest begins in August, when the first eggs of
these birds are taken from two barren rocks near the cliffs. Men and
youths swim to these rocks, and the one who first secures an egg is held
in high esteem; he lords it over the others for twelve months, his food
being furnished for him, and he is not permitted to bathe for three
months. A recent visitor says the people are so dirty that you could
suppose every man, woman, and child had performed the successful feet
the last feast-time. The last king was Kai Maker, who died about 1864,
when Peruvian ships visited Raps. Nui, and a. number of the natives
were seized and taken to work the guano on the Chincha. Islands, where
the greater number died. A few were finally sent back, and they
brought with them smell-pox, which caused great havoc and near] y (le-
populated the island. Water is scarce, but the climate is equable, and
one of the most delightful in the world, the thermometer seldom regis-
tering higher than 75deg to 80deg during the warmest season.

" An image and some other curiosities were brought away in 1886
by the United States steamer Mohican, which visited the island in that
year. They are now in the Naval Museum at Washington, and it is
hoped that some one will be able to decipher the hieroglyphics, which
thus far have remained without an interpreter."

V, HEN well clear of the Marquesas the Pera turned her prow to
the south-west, in the direction of Tahiti, which lay about nine
hundred miles away. The strong trade-wind bore her swiftly on her
course, and on the fourth day of the voyage the lofty peaks of Ota-
heite's isle rose into View. The
summits of the mountains seemed
to pierce the sky, so sharp and steep
were they, and almost to their very
tops they were covered with verd-
ure. Luxuriant forests were every-
where visible, and the shore was
fringed with a dense growth of
palms that seemed to rise from the
water itself.
The central peak of Tahiti has
00m WNW". "Hm an elevation of something more than
seven thousand feet, and from this
peak there is a series of ridges radiating towards the sea like the spokes
of a wheel. Many of these ridges are so steep on their sides that they
cannot be ascended, and so narrow that there is not room for an ordi-
nary path. A man standing on one of these ridges could with his right
hand throw a stone into one valley, and with his left a. stone into an-
other, whose inhabitants could communicate only by descending to the
coast, oruto the lowland which borders it. The valleys are luxuriant,
and even the ridges are covered with vines and bushes.

h;~:.....-... wTHE GREAT BARRIER REEF 0F TAHITI. 75

As the youths, with their glasses, eagerly scanned the coast they
were approaching, one of them called out that he could see a strip of
calm water close to the shore.

" We are coming to the great barrier-reef of coral," said Doctor Bron-
son, " and the calm water that you see is between the reef and the shore.

"Tahiti is one of the best examples of an island surrounded by a
coral reef," the Doctor continued. "It extends quite around the island,
sometimes only a few yards from it, and sometimes four or five miles
distant. There are occasional openings through the reef, some wide
and deep enough to permit the passage of large ships, and others prac
ticable only for small boats. Inside the reef the water is calm, and a.
vessel once within it has a secure harbor."

The boys could see the surf breaking on the reef with great vio-
lence, and throwing spray high into the air. Outside was the ever-
restless sea; inside lay the placid lagoon, which reflected the sunlight
as in a mirror.

" Just think of it," said Frank; "that great reef, which resists the
waves of the ocean, and could destroy the largest ship that floats, is
built up by a tiny worm which we could crush between our fingers
with the greatest ease. The pa-
tience of the honey-bee is nothing
i W", " compared to that of the coral in-

- ' ' . sect."

Fred asked what was the depth
of water near the reef, both inside
and outside.

 

 
 
 
 
  

 

  

SPECIMEN 017 CORAL.
Doctor Bronson answered that it varied greatly, the inner lagoon
being sometimes only a few feet, or perhaps inches, in depth, and
sometimes two, three, or five hundred feet. Outside there is generally
a great depth of water, sometimes so much that the sounding-lead fails
to find bottom at a distance of
only a few yards. "This consti-
tutes," he added, "one of the (lan-
gers of navigation, as a ship may
be close upon a reef without being
aware of it until too late.

"The coral insect," he contin-
ued, "does not work at a greater
depth than two hundred feet, and
he ceases operations when he reach-
es the surface. When these reefs
are more than two hundred feet
deep it is supposed that the bottom

m: con/u. wmm. has slowly receded and carried the

reef with it; as the recession went

on, the coral insect continued his work of building; It reminds me of

what happens sometimes to a railway in a swampy region; the em-

bankment for the track sinks from time to time, and a new one 'is

built above it. After a while sufficient earth has been thrown in to
make a solid foundation, and then the sinking ceases.

"The atoll is another curious form of the work of the coral insect,"
said the Doctor, continuing. " It is circular or oval in shape, the island
forming a rim that encloses a lake or lagoon. There is always an
opening from the sea to the lagoon, and it is generally on the leeward
side. Sometimes there are two, or even three or more openings, but
this is unusual; the island rises only a few feet above the water, and
is the work of the coral insect upon what was once the crater of a vol-
cano; at least that is the general belief.

"The atoll is not a desirable place for residence, as the ocean during
severe storms is liable to break across the narrow strip of land and
sweep away whatever may be standing there. Many atolls are unin-
habited,and none of them has a large population; cocoa-palms, bread-
fruit, and other tropical trees are generally found on the inhabited
atolls, and partially or wholly supply the natives with food. In some
instances the people support themselves by fishing either in the lagoon
or in the ocean outside. The lagoon forms a fairly good harbor forTHE HARBOR AT PAPEITI. 77

ships and canoes, but sometimes the water in it is too deep for anchor-
ing."

As the minutes rolled on, the outlines of the mountains and ridges,
the valleys and forests, grew more and more distinct. Frank and Fred
strained their eyes to discover an opening in the reef, but for some time
their earnest gaze was unrewarded. At length, however, Frank saw a
spot where the long line of spray appeared to be broken; gradually
it enlarged, and revealed a. passage into the great encircling moat of
Tahiti. It was the entrance to the harbor of I'apeiti, the capital of_ the
French possessions in this part of the Pacific.

The yacht glided safely through the channel and anchored in front
of Papeiti, or Papaete, as some writers have it. Two French warships
were lying there, and several schooners and other sailing-craft en-
gaged in trade among the islands. Then there were some halfdozen
ships and barks from various parts of the world, bringing cargoes of
miscellaneous goods for the Tahitian market and carrying away the
produce of the islands. Frank looked in vain for an ocean-going mer-
chant steamer, and found, on inquiry, that the Society Islands are not
visited by any of the steamships engaged in the navigation of the
Pacific. '

 

ON rm: SHORE 0F rm: LAGOON.

The Society Islands are a group, consisting of two clusters about
seventy miles apart. Some geographers apply the name to the north-
western cluster only, while the other is known as the Tahiti or Geor-
gian group. The latter is the largerand more populous, and is a French
colony, while the former is independent. The Spaniards claim to have
discovered Tahiti in 1606, and it was visited in 1767 by Captain Wallis,
who named it King George's Island. Two years later Captain Cook
discovered the north-western cluster, called the whole group the Society
Islands in honor of the Royal Geographical Society, and restored to

Tahiti its native name.
"Why is Tahiti sometimes called Otaheite, and why is Hawaii, in
the Sandwich Islands, sometimes called Owyhee '1'" Fred inquired.

"Thereby hangs a tale," replied the Doctor, "or rather a great deal
of conjecture. Some ethnographers think the islands of Polynesia. were
peopled from the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, while others think
they were peopled from Japan. Advocates of either theory have a
great number of arguments in its support. We haven't time to go over
the list; and even if we did we should not be able to settle the question.

 

 

 

A CABIN IN THE SGHURBS.

The theory that the inhabitants of the Sandwich and Society islands
came originally from Japan is supported by the use in their languages
of the prefix O (signifying " honorable") exactly as it is used in Japan.
As the Japanese say 0-yama (honorable mountain), so the Hawaiians
say O-wyhee, and the Tahitians O-taheite.

"Many Japanese sports, such as archery, wrestling, boxing, spear-
throwing, and slinging stones, were in vogue in some of the islands at
the time of their discovery; they are rapidly passing away as the peo-
ple become civilized, and in another generation or two will hardly beon SHORE IN mum. 79'

heard of. In their language they are nearer like the Malay than the
Japanese; that they are of Malay origin is very clearly proven, but
exactly how they came here it is not likely we shall ever know."

While this conversation was going on the yacht was visited by
a custom-house ofliciul, who took the declaration of the captain as to
her nationality and name, and her object in visiting Tahiti, and then
returned to shore. Our friends followed him, and in a very short time
were pressing their feet against the solid earth of Papeiti. For an
account of what they saw we will again refer to Fred's journal.

" You cannot see much of Papeiti from anywhere," said Fred, " be-
cause of the great numbers of trees that grow in and around the place.
Here they are: bread-fruit, hibiscus, cocoa-palms, and half a dozen other
varieties, so that nearly every house is hid from view until you are close
upon it. The row of shops and eafes near the water is an exception to
the rule; they are like the same kind of establishments everywhere in
a French colony, and reveal the nationality of the place at a glance.

 

Tllll COAST IN A STORM.

" There are mountains in every direction excepting towards the sea,
and through a gorge at the back of the town a particularly fine mount-
ain is visible. Most of the houses are only one story in height, espe
cially in the outskirts, where the well-to-do residents have their villas.
In the town there are a few two or three storied buildings, belonging to
the foreign merchants or used for Government purposes; but these are
exceptions to the general aversion to stair-ways. Land is so cheap here
that everybody ought to have plenty of room.

"The names of the streets make us think of Paris. The principal
one is the Rue de Rivoli, and there we find the hotels, shops, and cafes,
or rather the most of them. On the Rue de Commerce are the ware-
houses, where goods and provisions are stored; and the Rue de Po-
logne, which is the widest and best shaded of all, is mainly given up
to the Chinese for shops and teahouses. The Chinaman'has taken
root here, and flourishes; every year the Chinese hold upon business
increases, and some of the French residents advocate the expulsion of
the Mongolians, through fear that they will soon have a monopoly of
the commerce of the islands. .

"In the resident part of the town nearly every house stands in its "
own garden, and the most of these gardens are prettily laid out. There
are good roads in and around the place, and we have had some charm-
ing drives, sometimes in carriages, which we hired at one of the hotels,
and sometimes by invitation of the residents. We have had a most
hospitable reception, and everybody from the Governor down has tried
to make us enjoy our visit. -

" The English consul invited us to dine at his country residence, and
afterwards treated us to a moonlight excursion on the water. It was
very pretty, as the lagoon was as calm as a mirror, and there were
many beats out at the same time. The natives seem to be a careless,
' fun-loving people. Wherever there is a. group of them there is always
more or less laughter going on, and they seem to be constantly playing
harmless little jokes on one another. The evenings here are delightful,
and it is the custom to go out after dinner. The favorite resort is the
lawn near the Government-house; a band from one of the ships-of-war
plays there every evening, and always has a large audience. The
natives are very fond of music, and when it is lively they fall to danc-
ing on the green turf.

"The population of the two clusters that form the Society group is
said to be a little less than twenty thousand, three-fourths of them
belonging to the Tahitian cluster and onefourth to the north-western.
The native population of this island is about eight thousand. There are
about one thousand Chinese on the islands, eight hundred French, two
hundred and fifty British subjects, and one hundred and fifty Americans,
and perhaps one hundred of other nationalities.

"They tell us that we can drive in a carriage all the way around
Tahiti, a distance of one hundred and sixty miles, and that we can hard-
ly go a mile of this distance without coming to a stream of clear water
rolling or rippling down from the mountains. Most of these streams
are simply rivulets or brooks, but some of them are rivers too large and
deep to be forded. Some of these rivers have'been bridged, but where
this has not been done they must be crossed by ferry-boats. Villages
are scattered at intervals of a few miles, and any one who undertakes
the journey can be comfortably lodged every night, especially if heTHE FRENCH IN TAHITI.' 81

sends a courier in advance to' arrange matters for him. Colonel Bush
had an idea of making the journey, but concluded it would be tireSome
long before the circuit was completed, and so the scheme was aban-
doned.

" One of the early missionaries brought some orange-trees here, and
they were found admirably adapted to the soil and climate of Tahiti.
You see orange-groves or orangetrees everywhere, and we have never
found finer oranges in any part of the world. It is a curious fact that
the best trees are those which have grown from seed scattered careless-
ly about without any thought of planting , in nearly every case they
are finer and more productive than those which have been calefully
cultivated and transplanted.

"The French have a jamdm cl'essa/i, or Experimental Garden, where
trees and plants from all parts of the world are cultivated with a view
to finding those best adapted to Tahiti. As a result of this garden and
other importations, the Tahitians now have mangoes, limes, shaddocks,
citrons, guavas, custard-apples, tam-
arinds, peaches, figs, grapes, pine-
apples, watermelons, cucumbers, cab-
bages, and other fruits and Vegetflr
bles of whose existence the people
were entirely ignorant a hundred
years ago.

" The French Government has a
garrison of about four hundred sol-
diers in Tahiti, with a large staff of
oflicials of various kinds--naval,
military, and civil. The Governor
is a personage of great local impor-
tance, am has very liberal powers
and can do pretty much as he likes. A FRENCH msflolh
We found him a very pleasant gen--
tleman. He invited all our party to a reception at the Government

' house, and the officeis of his staif showed us many attentions.

" The French took possession of Tahiti in 1842; they had been wait-
ing for an opportunity, and it came in that year. Three Catholic mis-
sionaries had been expelled by Queen Pomare at the instigation, so the
. French say, of the English missionaries. A French fleet came to Papeiti
and threatened to bombard the town unless her Majesty should pay

' immediately a large indemnity, and consent to the return of the ex-

6
polled missionaries. The Queen was quite unable to raise the money,
and the French took possession and established their protectorate.

" The protectorate continued till 1880, when the King, Pomare V.,
was persuaded to cede the nominal sovereignty in consideration of a life
pension of twelve thousand dollars annually. The annexation of Tahiti
as a French colony was formally proclaimed in Papeiti March 24th, 1881.

 

 

\'lBW IN AN ORANGE GROVE-

"The first missionaries that came here were sent by the London
Mission Society in 1797 ; but they made little progress in the conver-
sion of the natives, and after a time were driven away in consequence
of inter-tribal wars among the people. In 1812 the King invited them
to return; they did so, and in the following year a church was estab~
lished. '

' " The King was converted to Christianity, together with several ofHUMAN SACRIFICES.--HOW THE VICTIMS WERE SELECTED. 83

his priests and subordinate chiefs, and from that time on the work of
the missionaries progressed rapidly. Long before the French took pos-
session the entire population were nominally Christians, and had burned
. their idols and destroyed their heathen temples. There is no evidence
that they ever practised cannibalism, but they were cruel in war. Pris-
oners were slaughtered in cold blood, or oifered as sacrifices to the gods;
human sacrifices were common, and there were certain tribes and fami-
lies from whom, in times of peace, the victims for sacrifice were taken.
"In olden times these tribes and families were selected, and it is
said there was a third of the population whose lives might be taken at
any moment. When a victim was called for, resistance was useless, as
the whole population,'even including a. man's nearest neighbors, united
to carry him to the mac, or altar of sacrifice.

 

NATI'T BAIBOO HOUSE, TAIII'I'L

"In the early days of Christianity the victims for sacrifice were
taken from among the converts, and sometimes the heathen tribes com-
bined to hunt down the Christians in order to offer them to the gods.
It was the story over again of the persecution of the early Christians in

Rome and elsewhere in Europe.
"When the French took possession of the islands they oppressed
the English missionaries in various ways, and had it not been for the

persistence of the natives in adhering to the men who converted them,
the representatives of the London Mission would have been driven out
altogether. The trouble was finally compromised by allowing the Eng-
lish missionaries to remain under certain restrictions, and establishing a.

French Protestant mission to work in harmony with the French Cath-
- olie one.

 

NATIVBS 0'? THE SOCIETY ISLANDS FISHING.

" Thegreat bulk of the people are Protestants, as they adhere to the
faith to which they were originally'converted. The Society Islands as
a whole now contain three English missionaries, sixteen native ordained
ministers, and more than two hundred other preachers and teachers.
There are four thousand three hundred- church members, fifty schools,
and mere than two thousand scholars attending them. The French do
not make much interference except-on the island of Tahiti, where only
one English missionary is allowed to reside. He is not, however, rec-
ognized as a missionary to the natives, but as pastor of the Bethel
Church at Papeiti." ~

"That will do for statistics on that subject," said Frank. "While
you have been looking up these points in the history of the islands I've
been finding out what they produce."

"I was getting around to that," replied Fred, " but if you've found
it out I'm glad. What is it i"

" From all I can learn," said Frank, _" the colony isn't a very pros>>
perous one for the French. The exports amount to about a million
dollars annually, and the imports to seven hundred thousand dollars ;.
there we no import duties except on fire-arms and spirits, but I am told
it is proposed to place a duty on neai 1y everything consumed hele, so as
to make the colony self-- supporting.

"The people have quite abandoned the manufacture of tappa, orCOMMERCE OF THE SOCIETY ISLANDS. 85

native cloth, and dress entirely in goods of European make, They have
learned how to distil intoxicating liquor from the orange, and this de-
licious fruit threatens to be a. curse to them instead of a. blessing. They
have given up tattooing, which was never practised to so great an ex-
tent as in the Marquesas; there would be no use for tattooing now, as
they have all taken to wearing clothes just as in the Sandwich Islands.

" As to the products of the islands," continued Frank, " they consist
principally of cocoanutoil and coppra (the dried substance of the cocoa-
nut, from which oil is extracted after its arrival in Europe), arrow-root,
cotton, sugar, and mother-of -p_ear1 shells. The cotton cultivation has
not been profitable; and as to the trade in sugar, it has not been any-
where nearly so successful as in the Sandwich Islands."

" You have omitted one thing from your list of products," said Doc-
tor Bronson, as Frank paused. " You have made no mention of beche-

de-mer." '
" That's so," was the reply; " but the fact is, I wanted to learn more

about it than I know now."
" I thought so," said the Doctor, smiling, " and so I've arranged that
we will go' to the reef tomorrow morning to see how beche--de-mer is
taken. We must make an early start, so as to be there at daylight."

Further talk about the Society Islands was indefinitely postponed,
and the party adjourned to bed. All were up in ample season on the
marrow for the excursion to the reef.

The best time for visiting the reef is at low tide. The tides in the
Society Islands differ from those in most parts of the world, by never
varying from one day to another throughout the year. At noon and
at midnight is the height of the flood, and at six o'clock morning and
evening is the lowest of the ebb. Ordinarily the rise is about two feet;
periodically twice a year there comes a tidal-wave that breaks over
. the reef with great violence, and

sweeps across the lagoon to the
shore. '

Frank and Fred sought an ex-
planation of this tidal peculiarity,
but were unable to obtain a satis-
factory one. A resident of Papeiti
said the tides were so certain in
their movements that many people
were able to tell the time of day

very nearly by a glance at the reef.

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  

 

'nis mold or THE LAGOONi, WONDERS OF THE TAHITIAN REEF. 87

To the student of marine life a. coral reef is full of interest, and that
of Tahiti is one of the finest in the world. Here are some of the curi-
ous things that were described by our friends:

"We saw," said Frank, "some enormous starfish with fifteen arms
covered with sharp spines of a gray and orange color. These spines
were on the top of the arms; the bottom had an array of yellow feelers
like fingers, with suckers at the ends. The boatmen cautioned us not to
touch these creatures, but their
caution was not needed, as we all
kept our hands at a respectful dis-
tance.

" There were thousands and
thousands of sea-urchins, seine of
them with spikes as large as your
fingers and. stiff as a nail, down
to little fellows the size of a pig-

eon's egg, and armed with long needles like the quills of a porcupine.
It is no joke to step on one of these things when you are bathing in the '
sea and have your feet unprotected. Somebody has likened them to
thistles, and says they more or less resemble hedgehogs and porcupines.
Urchin, according to the dictionary, means hedgehog, and therefore the

name is not inappropriate. ,
" There are sea-anemones as large as a cheese, and of all the colors

you can imagine. An amusing thing about them was that a lot of lit;
tle fishes, not more than two inches long, were playing hideand-seek,
swimming around among the spines of these huge polyps. The water
is very clear, and as you look over the side of the boat into the garden
of coral with its great variety of colors, and its numerous inhabitants,
finny, shelly, and otherwise, it is like
a glimpse of fairy-land.
. "It made our flesh creep just a
little to see the water-snakes coiling
around the branches of coral, and
gliding about all unconscious of be-
ing gazed at. Then there are gold-
fish, blue-fish (not the blue-fish of
America, but a little fellow of the
brightest sky-blue you ever saw),
fish of a pale green, and so on
through all the scale of colors. As
.. they swam among the corals they
mun-cam nan su~silsLL. reminded us of butterflies in a gar-
den."

Fred saw a shell travelling along in a most unexpected way, which
he could not understand until he ascertained that it was occupied by a
hermitcrah. Then there were large crabs in their own shells, and also
lobsters, which kept a sharp eye out for danger, and retired to places of
security when the boat approached

The youths had hoped to be able to walk on the reef but the surf
was so high that it was unsafe to venture there. Besides, the walking,
even when the reef is comparatively dry, is not of the best, as the sur-
face is rough, and there are many holes in the coral in which the novice
mayg act a dangerous fall.- '

Many fishing- boats- were about, as the time of low tide is the best
for fishing, and the water furnishes an important part of the food of
the people. Several fishermen, nearly naked, and armed with spears,
were in the foaming waters at the outer edge of the reef, waiting, with

' their weapons poised, ready to strike anything that came within their
reach. A dozen or more large fish were taken in this way while our
friends were looking on; not once did the spearmen miss hitting their
mark, and Frank and Fred both wanted to applaud them for their
accuracy of aim.

Inside the lagoon other fishermen were pursuing their prey in beats,
the spearmen standing ready in the bow to embrace every opportunity
of striking. Men and women were fishing after the ordinary mannerFISHING 1N 'l'AHITIAN WATERS. 89

of civilization, and with civilized
hooks and lines. Formerly they
used hooks of pearl-shell and
bone, and also hooks of the roots'
of the ironwood-tree. But in
these modern days the ordinary
hooks of commerce are almost
the only ones ever seen' in Tahiti.

Then there were net-fishers in
great number, and with many va-
rieties of net. Seines, pursenets,
castingmets, (lip-nets, all were
'there, and all handled with the
dexterity which is only attained
by long practice.

The guide explained that some
of the fishes Which were excellent
eating at one time of the year
were poisonous at another. The
poisonous condition is caused by
their crunching the coral at the
time it is said to be in blossom,
and by eating sea-centipedes,

which resemble a yard or two of black string with the smallest imagi-
nable legs. All the land-crabs of Tahiti are edible, but several sea-crabs
are not; and there is one variety so poisonous that it is only eaten
when the eater wishes to commit suicide.

 

 

 

A "SI! INSIDE A SKA-SLUO.

Beautiful shells are brought up from the depths of the waters, but
they must be touched with great care, as the spines of many of them
are poisonous. One of them, scientifically known as Comes With, a
beautiful shell of conelike shape, has been known to cause death in a
few hours, the symptoms being much like those produced by the bite of
a rattlesnake. Some of the jelly-fishes of England and America have
the same poisonous character, but in a much smaller degree,

The guide hailed a boat which was filled with searslugs, sea--cucum-
bers, tripang, or bechede-mer, as this article of commerce is variously
known, and the youths had an opportunity of examining the curious
marine product. They were cautioned not to touch them, as these ap-
parently helpless creatures, which resembled sausages or bags of India-
rubber filled with seawater, were not as harmless as they appeared.
The guide said they ejected this water when touched; and if it fellTHE BECHE-DE--MER rises". 91

on a wound or scratch, or into the eye, it caused intense pain, and some-
times resulted in temporary or even permanent blindness.

The sea-slugs were of all colors--black, red, gray, and two or three
varieties of green. The most dangerous is an olive~green one marked
with orange spots, and hence called the leopard. When it is disturbed it
throws up long filaments like threads or strings, which adhere very tenar
ciously; and wherever they touch the skin they raise a burning blister.

Most of the sea-slugs are caught in still water by divers, who use
forks with long prongs, with which they secure their prey. There is
one variety, the red one, which is taken in the surf, but all the others
prefer quiet nooks. 'When a canoe has been filled with these repulsive-
looking objects it proceeds to the drying establishment on shore. There
the creatures are thrown into-a kettle of boiling water sufficiently long
to kill them; then they are cleaned, and stewed for half an hour, and
then placed on racks of sticks for smoking and drying.

The smoking must be kept up for three days, and longer if the
weather is damp, and then the leathery substance is ready for packing
in palm-leaf baskets for transportation to China. Great care must be
taken to have it thoroughly dried, as the least remaining moisture will
spoil it during its long voyage in '
the hold of a ship.

Sometimes fishes are found in-
side the searslug, and it seems to
be well established that they live
altogether in this contracted sea-
water tank. When taken out and
placed in clear saltwater they soon
die, in spite of every precaution.

While looking over the side of
the boat Fred saw a large clam,
and immediame coveted it. The
guide engaged a diver who was
near by, and for a small reward the
man went below for the prize. COMM"

The clam was lying with his
mouth open, and evidently enjoying his morning bath of sea-water.
The diver inserted a sharply pointed stick into the flesh of the mollusk,
and the shell closed upon it instantly. Then he severed the filaments
which attached the clam to the rock, and with one hand below the shell
and another holding the stick. made his way to the surface.
"Most of the diving for clams is done by the women," said the
guide, while Fred was gazing at the huge shell, nearly two feet long,
which lay before him. "Many a woman, and many a man too," con-
tinued the guide, " has been
nipped by the shell and drown-
ed there, totally unable to es-
cape. In all parts of the South
Pacific you will hear horrible
stories of death in this way.
These clams grow to a great
size, as. you' see; half a shell
often serves as a bath-tub for
a child, and in the Catholic
churches of Polynesia it is used.
, for holy water.

mm, on nruwxss. . " Some years ago a, native in

the Paumotan Islands was div-

ing for pearl-oysters, and while feeling around for them accidentally

thrust his hand inside a gaping clamshell, which closed on him in-

stantly. The shell was in a. hole in the coral, so that he could not

reach the back to detach it; the only thing he could do was to sever

his fingers with the knife in his free hand. He thus saved himself from
being drowned, but was maimed for life."

The guide called the attention of the youths to some large eels
which were coiled up in the coral. He said they were very voracious,
and many natives had been deprived of fingers by these uncanny creat-
ures. They sometimes reach a length of eight or ten feet, and one poor
fellow had the whole calf of a leg bitten off by
one of them.

Then there are a. great many cuttle-fish,
and sometimes the girls and women are caught
and overpowered by them. The danger from
these creatures is so well known that the na-
tives rarely go out alone to dive for them or
for clams. Some of the cuttle-fish measure six
feet across; they lie in holes in the coral, and s"mm"m- 0" "*WVW
throw out their long arms to grasp anything
that comes in their reach. They cling around the body of a diver or
wrap themselves about his head, and unless speedily relieved by his
companions his death is inevitable.SHARKS ATTACKIN G BOATS. 93

"Are there any more dangers among the reefs ?" said Frank, when
all these had been recounted.

" Yes," was the reply; " there are great numbers of sharks, some of
them harmless and others dangerous. The worst is a White shark,
thirty feet long, and he is so bold that he has been known to attack
canoes, either by overturning them and throwing their occupants into
the water, or by seizing an arm or leg which happened to be out-
stretched, and dragging its owner overboard.

l

 

GARDEN OF A SUBURBAN WIDENCE.

" There is a smaller shark, six or eight feet long, which lives in caves
in the coral, and comes out in search of food. Its flesh is good to eat,
and one of these sharks is quite a prize. In some of the groups of
islands the fishermen dive into the shark caverns while the monster
is asleep, and pass a noose around his tail; then the man rises instantly
to the surface, and his companions haul up the ugly creature tail first,
stunning him with a club or hammer as he comes over the side of the
boat."

"' But suppose," said one of the youths, " that after the diver has
entered the cave the shark should change his position and get across
the door-way."

" In that case," replied the guide, "his only mode of escape will be ,
to tickle the shark so as to induce him to move aside. He can only
do this when its tail is towards him; if he has turned the other way
the man's fate is practically sealed "

Fred concluded that he would never indulge in diving for sharks
as a means of livelihood, and Frank fully agreed with him

Then the guide told them of the stingaree, or sting-ray, which is not
unknown in American waters, but grows to a much greater size here
than on the coast of the United States. Its tail has a sharp, barbed
point, which generally breaks ofi' when struck into the flesh; the point
is serrated on both sides, the teeth pointing backward, and so it works
its way inward like the quill of a porcupine. Other dangers of the
water were described; but it is time to return from the reef, and so
we will leave them there.

On their return to Papeiti our friends visited the market, going
first to the section where'fish were offered for sale. Here is Frank's
note upon what they saw there:

"There were fishes of all sizes and kinds: bonito, rockfish, eels,
clams, oysters, mussels, turtle, salmon from the rivers, prawns, crabs,
and a great many varieties of finny and scally things. that have no
name in English. The natives are fond of raw fish, and we saw them
swallowing little fishes whole and slices of big ones just as we would
dispose of a basket of strawberries. One of the first persons we saw
in the market was a pretty girl of eighteen or twenty who was crunch-
ing live shrimps, or letting them wriggle down her throat as readily
as she would swallow so many sugaI-plums.

"Some European residents have acquired the taste for raw fish,
and they say it is delicious. We have not ventured upon it, though
we take clams and oysters raw according to the practice of our own
country. The tropical bivalves are not so good as those of temper-
ate regions, and I believe this is the general testimony of travellers.

"The market is well supplied with chickens, turkeys, pigeons, andMARKET SCENES IN TAHITI. 95

ducks, which are nearly always sold alive, as the heat of the climate
prevents their being kept more than a few hours after slaughtering.
Pigs are sold alive, and they are carried about suspended by their hind-
legs from a pole. It is painful to hear them squeal, and there ought to
be a. Tahitian branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals to put a, stop to this barbarity.

 

 

 

GATHERING ORANGE NR 'HIR YEAST.

"Most of the market-people were natives, but I observed a, good
many Chinese there, especially in the section devoted to vegetables
and fruits. These people take very naturally to vegetable gardens,
and their patient industry is well rewarded by the fertile soil of Ta,-
hiti."

On reaching the hotel, our friends found an invitation to a feast
which one of the merchants was to give the next day at his country
residence, in native style. They immediately sent acceptances, and
were ready at the time appointed for the carriage which was provided
by their thoughtful host.

"When we reached the house," said Fred,"eaoh of us was pro-
vided with a new bathing-dress and towels, and proceeded to the river
close by, where numbers of guests were already enjoying a bath in the
clear water. The party straggled back in twos and threes; and as fast
as we returned every one of us was crowned with a wreath of flowers
after the Tahitian custom. There was a great deal of fun and laugh-
ter about this part of the entertainment, but everybody enjoyed it,
and entered heartily into the sport of the occasion. The guests in-
cluded all our party fiom the yacht, the officers from the ships of
war, every stranger of consequence in Papeiti, and pretty nearly every
respectable resident

" By the time everybody had returned from the bath and received
his crown the feast was announced, and we went in procession to the
dining-hall. This proved to be a. temporary building, made of a slight
framework of bamboos and banana-trees, covered with a thatch of
palm-leaves and decorated with festoons of leaves and vines.

" The building was erected over a. fine piece of lawn, and the table
was spread on the grass. Instead of a table as we understand it, flesh
bananarleaves \vere spread on the grass, and on these the good things
of the feast were laid. On the grass at the edge of this novel table-
cloth mats made of cocoa fibre were spread, and on these 'mats we sat
down native fashion. It was rather awkward getting down to the
floor, but of course the awkwardness added to the fun of the occasion.

"The substantial part of the feast consisted of turkeys, chickens,
and young pigs, roasted and served cold, and then there were all kinds
of fin and shell fish, both raw and cooked. All the fruits of the island
Were there, and all the vegetables, including yains,.sweet- potatoes,
cucumbers, and the like. European wines took the place of the native
drink, kcwc, which is rapidly going out of use.

"Instead of plates, each of us had a pile of bread-fmit leaves which
served as plates, and in front of each guest there were four half cocoa-
nut-shells.' . One was full of drinking-water, the second full of milk, the
third contained chopped cocoanut, and the fourth sea-water. The sea
water was emptied into the chopped cocoanut to form a sauce like the
Chinese soy, into which the various articles of food were dipped before
being conveyed to the mouth, and then the shell was filled with fresh
Water, and used as a. finger-glass.

" We enjoyed the feast very much, though all of us confessed after-
wards to a back-ache, from the novelty of_ our positions. After the
feast there was dancing in the spacious parlor of our host, and the
festivities were kept up until late in the evening."A SOHVIZNIR OI' CAPTAIN COOK.

An excursion was made the next day to Point Venus, which has a
historic interest, as it is the promontory where Captain Cook made the
astronomical observations by which he determined the correct position
of the Society Islands. The name of the place commemorates his ob--
servation of the transit of Venus which he and his scientific party made '
here in 1769.

It was a. delightful ride along the Broom-road, as it is called, shaded
by palm and bread-fruit trees, and through groves of oranges, citrons,
guavas, bananas, and other tropical productions. Our friends inspected
the light-house which is maintained here to direct the mariner approach-
ing Papeiti, and Frank made a. sketch of the tamarind-tree planted by
Captain Cook near the spot where he made the famous observations.

THE Society Islands are between latitude 16deg and 18deg south, and

nation of the Para, lie in latitude 13deg to 15deg south, and longitude 169deg

of west, and gave the party a pleasant run before the north-east trade-
Wind, the crew having hardly anything to do from the time the last
peak of the Society Islands disappeared until the mountains of Samoa.
came into view. All the world over, there is no more delightful sailing
than in the trade-winds. A ship bowls along for ten, twenty, or perhaps
thirty days, without squaring a
yard or changing a brace, and all
the time she carries every stitch of
her canvas, and the water beneath
her bows is a bank of foam.
During the voyage our young
friends busied themselves as usual
in learning something about the
regions whither they were bound,
as well as perfecting their informa-
tion about what they were leaving
behind. The conversation turned
one day upon the work of the mis-
sionaries in the South Pacific in re-
deeming the inhabitants of the isl-
ands from their former condition

 

DR. (JOAN, MISSIONARY 1'0 munn. 0f barbarlsm'
" The misswnaries have not re-

ceived half the credit they deserve," said Doctor Bronson, in reply to
a question which Fred propounded. " It is the fashion among certain
men who have had commercial relations with these islands to deride
the missionaries and throw ridicule on their work, and sometimes trav-
ellers fall into the same way of talking. There are idlers and useless
men and women among the missionaries, just as there are in every oc-
cupation in life, but this circumstance does not justify the denunciation
that has been heaped upon the entire body."

Frank asked why it was that so many men engaged in commerce
were opposed to the missionaries.

"Principally for the reason," was the reply, " that the missionaries
defend the natives ' <<rainst the dishonesty of certain classes of traders,
and thus reduce their profits. There are honest men and dishonest ones
engaged in commerce in Polynesia, just as there are elsewhere. When
you hear a Polynesian merchant denouncing the missionaries in vehe'
ment terms, you may fairly conclude that the missionaries have stood
in his way when he was endeavoring to defraud the natives. He is
a man not to be trusted, at least that is a fair inference, though in
this as in everything else he may be an exception.
"Let me give you an illustration of this," continued the Doctor.
"Some years ago I heard a retired sea--captain in New York denouncing
the missionaries, and declaring that they .had ruined the trade of the
South Pacific. It was at a dinner-party, and before the end of the even-
ing the old captain became quite communicative about the ways of com-
merce with Polynesia and the Malay Archipelago. Amongother things
he told how they traded with the natives in his younger days. 'We
used,' said he, 'to take our old-fashioned balance scales on shore with
our fiftysix pound and smaller weights with handles to them. Weset
up the scales, and then the natives brought forward some bags whose
exact weight they knew. These bags were used for testing our weights,
to see that they were correct. Of course they were all right; the test-
ing and setting up the scales took the best part of the afternoon, and
then we knocked ofl' for the day,

" ' We left the scales on shore where they had been set up, but took

 

N0 RFSPRC'I FOR MISSIONABXBS.

the weights back to the ship " for safety." They were hollow, and the
handles were screwed in; during the night we unscrewed the handles,
filled the hollow space with lead, and then screwed the handles back
again so neatly that nobody would ever discover anything. In this
way we managed to get the cargo to average 160 to 170 pounds a picul
(133 pounds); and in those days a supercargo or captain who couldn't
make a cargo come up to at least 150 pounds a picul wasn't wanted an-
other voyage by the owners. Trade went on that way until the mis-
sionaries found out all about this 'and other tricks, and told the natives.
They never would have suspected anything if it hadn't been for the
missionaries.' - '

" This man," continued the Doctor," was no worse than many others
in the same line of business; and if all stories are true, he was no worse
than many of our forefathers, who made money by their dealings with
the savages in the early (lays of American colonization. The belief
that it is no sin to cheat the infidel and heathen is not by any means
conlined to the followers of Mohammed. It is easy to understand why
he was opposed to the missionary labels in the South Seas, as they cer-

tainly tended, in his estimation, to the ruin of commerce. "

One of the youths asked if this opposition to the Christianizing of
the heathen was prevalent among the large mercantile houses, as well
as among the small and independent traders.

"It is impossible to answer this question with plain yes or no," was
the reply; " but it is safe to say that a. very large section of the com-
mercial community of every nation is unfavorable or, at all events, in-
different to missionary enterprises. Even national power is sometimes
invoked in the interest of commerce, without regard to the effect upon
the heathen. British artillery forced the Chinese to open their markets
to the opium of India, and the power of British, French, German, and
other arms on the coast of Africa, for purposes of trade, is well known.
Even America is not without sin in this respect; American diplomacy,
backed by American ships of war, opened the ports of Japan, and the
history of our dealings with our own Indians reveals many instances of
bloodshed or oppression in the interests of post-traders and other spec
ulators.

"Until its failure a few years ago, the German house of Godo--
froy & Sons was by far the largest firm or association doing' business
in the Pacific. It had large fleets of ships, it had branch houses in
many parts of the world; in numerous islands of the Pacific its agents
were established, and it owned lands and buildings of immense value.
In the harbor of Apia, Samoa, they had a shipyard, where they not
only repaired old ships but built new ones, and they owned several ex--
cellent harbors in other parts of Polynesia. There was not a single
group of islands of any consequence where they were not established,
and they had a great influence with the German Government.OPPOSITION T0 MISSIONARY WORK. 103

" Now, do you suppose this great house Was friendly to the mission-
aries--the men who came here and opened the way for commerce?
Not a bit of it. Here is an extract from their general orders to their
agents everywhere: '

" 'Never assist missionaries by word or deed, but, wheresoever you may find them,
use your best influence to obstruct and exclude tlIem.' *

"The efiect of these instructions is illustrated in the experience of

the American missionary ship Morning Star, several years ago, in a

 

TRADING STATION IN THE PACIFIC-

_visit to the Kingsmill group of islands, near the equator. A pilot came
out to meet the ship, and made her anchor three miles from shore to
wait the permission of the King before any one could land. When the
King learned that it was a. missionary ship, he sent word that he would
supply any needed provisions, but on no account could any one come on
shore. The traders had told him that if any missionaries were allowed

 

. ' New Zealand Blue-book, 1874, evidence of Mr. Sterndale, late employe of Godefroy
& Sons.
to land they would bewitch him and his people, and he had determined
to protect himself from harm.

" N umei ous instances of the demoralizing effects of commerce, when
controlled by bad men, can be given. The missionaries were the first
to occupy Polynesia, when traders could not venture there; some of
these good men lost their
lives, but the work of tam-
ing the savages went on un-
til commerce could follow
in their footsteps. You
might naturally expect that
commerce would be grate
ful, but such is far from be-
ing the ease."

Then the conversation
turned upon the history of
missionary efl'orts in the
South Pacific from the
opening enterprise of the
London Mission near the
end of the last century.
Frank and Fred made co-
pious notes on the subject
from the books within their
reach, and the information

from these notes they sub-
sequently condensed the following interesting story:

The London Missionary Society was formed in 1795 by zealous men
of difierent denominations; the call for the first meeting was signed by
eighteen Independent clergymen, seven Presbyterian, three Wesleyan
(Methodist), and three Episcopal, and the assemblage was held Septem-
ber 22d of that year. The islands of the Pacific were then attracting
attention in consequence of the mutiny of the Boa/My and the death
of Captain Cook, and they were selected as the first field of operations.

Many young men ofi'ered themselves as missionaries, and of all the
number of applicants twenty-nine were selected. The first delegation
landed on Tahiti March 4, 1797, and formed the first mission of the
Society. From that beginning the South Seas have been gradually cov-
ered with missions, and the Society has pushed its work into other fieldsHOW POLYNESIA HAS BEEN CHRISTIANIZED. 105

which we-need not consider here. It still adheres to its original plan
of avoiding denominational differences of doctrine and Church govern-
ment, and zealously pursues its work. Nearly all the denominations of
Protestants have since organized separate missions of their own, both
in Great Britain and America, for spreading the Gospel in the South
Seas. In our account of the Sandwich and Society islands the work of
the missionaries has been described; we have seen how whole popula>>
tions have renounced heathenisin and its practices, have been provided
with written languages, and with schools and churches, and have been

, changed from savages to civilized men and women. And all this is
due to the work of the missionary, who labored for the good of his
fellow- man.

 

 

 

MISSION CHURCH AND STATION.
 

MISSION PARK MONUMENT.

More than three hundred islands of the Pacific have abandoned
their heathenism, and nearly half a million of Polynesian savages have
been virtually Christianized. Their communicants who have been gath-
ered into the churches number fully sixty thousand, not including the
inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, who are now supporting missions
of their own.

One reason of the success of the mission work is the common-sense
that prevailed at the outset in dividing the field among the different
denominations, so that the minds of the natives should not be confused
as to the character of the teachings they were receiving.

This was done through a friendly agreement between the London
Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Mission, the former having ex-AMERICAN BOARD or FOREIGN MISSIONS. 107

elusive charge of the work in the Samoan Islands, and the Wesleyans
taking possession of the Feejee and Tonga groups: Other groups were
disposed of in the same way as time went on, and the arrangement
was found entirely satisfactory. Catholic missions have been estab-
lished in some of 'the islands where the Protestant missions were al-
ready settled; they have made poor progress, as the natives showed
an unwillingness to abandon the faith they had adopted for another.
The American Board of Foreign Missions was organized in Mission
Park, Williamstown, Massachusetts, in the early part of this century,
and the organization is commemorated by an appropriate monument.
It has evangelized the Hawaiian Islands, and carried on work in the
Marquesas, Gilbert, Marshall, and Caroline islands. Since 1873 most
of the active labor has been performed by the Hawaiian Evangelical
Association, which owns a mission vessel, the Morning Star.

 

MISSION Bflfl' ON HER VOYAGE.

The London Missionary Society has missions in the Society, Tua-
motu, Hervey or Cook, Austral, Samoa, Tokelau, Ellice, Gilbert, and
Loyalty groups, on Nine and several other isolated islands, and in
New Guinea. It owns two vessels, the John Williams and the Ellen,-
gown/n.

The Australian Wesleyan Conference supports missions in Tonga,
Feejee, Samoa, Rotumah, and New Britain; the Presbyterian churches
of Australia have a mission in the New Hebrides, and possess a mis-
sion vessel, called the Dag/331216119.

The Melanesian Episcopal Mission is maintained in the Banks', Santa
Cruz, and Solomon islands, and has a mission vessel, called the Southm
Grass. The Catholics have missions on all the islands controlled by the
French, and on most of the others, but they did not make their appear-
ance until long after the work had been well under way in the hands
of the Protestant organizations.

A considerable proportion of the early missionaries were murdered
by the natives, whose good they sought, and others died of disease, pri-
vation, and the eflects of the climate. But the ranks were steadily
filled up, and the work went on; the native converts and teachers were
fully as zealous as the white men who had taught them the new relig-
ion, and much of the work of instruction was performed by them.
Whenever native teachers were murdered by the savages among whom
they had taken their residences, others volunteered to fill their places.
The following incident is recorded in the history of mission work in
Polynesia:

In 1822 the mission ship of the Rev. John Williams anchored off
an island which proved to be Mangaia of the Hervey group. Three
Tahitian teachers, two of them accompanied by their wives, volunteered
to land and establish a mission. No sooner were they on shore than
they were attacked and plundered of everything they possessed, and
they only escaped with their lives by swimming back through the
surf to the ship.

A few months later the mission ship went there again, and two un-
married teachers, Davida and Tiere, sprang into the sea and swam to
the shore, carrying nothing but the clothing they were and a portion of
the New Testament in Tahitian, which was wrapped in cloth and tied
on their heads. A great crowd assembled at the landing, and as they
stepped on shore several warriors levelled spears at them. The King
took the swimmers under his protection, treated them kindly, took
them to the temple, and pronounced them tabu, or sacred, so that the
natives should not harm them.

Within two years Tiere died, but the work of conversion went on
so well that one day the King and his chiefs determined to give up
idolatry. They carried the thirteen idols which they had hitherto
worshipped to the house of Davida, and announced that for thefuture
they would worship the God of the white man. These thirteen idols
are now preserved in the museum of the London Missionary Society.MISSIONARY WORK IN THE HERVEY ISLES. 109

In 1821 Mr. Williams decided to send a mission from Raiatea to
the Hervey Isles, of which very little was known beyond the bare exist-
ence of such a group, and that it was inhabited by fierce cannibals.
Several native converts from Raiatea were landed on the island of
Aitutaki; they were well received by the chief and his people, but Mr.
Williams had great fears for their safety, owing to the bad character
of the cannibal inhabitants.

 

LANDING ON AN ATOLL OF THE HBRVBY'GKOUP.

In the following year, when the mission ship went there again,
great was the joy of Mr. Williams to learn that all the inhabitants
had abandoned idolatry, burned their temples, and decided to be Chris-
tians; they had built a large church, kept the Sabbath religiously, and
on the day following the arrival of the mission ship two thousand of
them assembled on the beach in solemn prayer, which was led by the
delighted missionary. After the service they brought their idols and
carried them on board the mission ship, so that the people of the other
islands might see for themselves that they had discarded altogether the
worship of the worthless images.

The story of the conversion of the inhabitants of the island of Ram-
tonga, of the Hervey group, sounds like romance. So little was known
of this island that Mr. Williams-had great trouble in finding it, as its
latitude and longitude had not been established. Among the converts
on another island were six natives of Raratonga; one of these men told
Mr. Williams that if he would sail to a given point on the island of
Aitutaki, he could take bearings that would carry him where he wished
to go. So, taking the six Raratongans on board, he steered for the
point indicated, and by following the directions of the man the island
they sought was reached.

The young King came on board, and agreed to take the six natives
ashore, and also a. Tahitian teacher, who had volunteered to remain.
The King, Matea, a handsome fellow six feet high, and with every inch
of his skin elaborately tattooed, was one of the first converts. Within
a year the whole population had become Christian, and there was not a
house on the island where the family did not assemble morning and
evening for divine worship. Mr. Williams and another missionary
went there with their families in 1827, and were met at the shore by
several thousands of natives, who shook hands with them so vigorously
that their arms ached for hours afterwards. A few days after their
arrival the people came in procession, bringing fourteen enormous idols,
for which they had no further use, the smallest of them being fifteen
feet high.

A new church was erected capable of containing three thousand
people; some of the idols were used as pillars of this building, and the
rest were burned. The railing of the pulpit stairs of this church was
made of spears which the chiefs contributed, and all the heathen tem-
ples, and even their foundations, were completely broken up.

The Hervey Islands'are now a centre of missionary work in the
South Pacific. The islanders have a-theological college, which has sent
out nearly two hundred trained teachers and preachers of their own,
and about half this number are scattered among the isles of the Pacific
where the inhabitants have not yet renounced heathenism or their can-
nibal practices. In 1881 four of these missionaries, with their wives
and children, twelve persons in all, were murdered by the natives of
New Guinea, and several others narrowly escaped with their lives.

Shortly after settling in the Hervey Islands Mr. Williams deter-
mined to carry the Gospel to the Navigator's, or Samoan group. Hav-
ing no ship, he built a boat, sixty feet long and eighteen feet wide, with
the aid of the Raratonga natives. He wanted a blacksmith's bellows to
shape the iron-work, and in order to make it he killed three of his four
goats to obtain their skins. In a. single night his bellows was devoured

by the rats, the only quadrupeds indigenous to the islands, and he then
invented a pump by which air could be forced.

I-Iis boat took fifteen weeks for its construction. Its sails were of
native matting, the cordage was of the bark of the hibiscus, the oakum
for calking the seams was made from banana stumps and cocoanutMURDER OF THE MISSIONARY REV. JOHN WILLIAMS. 111

husks, and the sheaves were of iron-wood. To obtain planks, trees
were split with wedges, and then cut up with hatchets. One anchor
was of stone, and another of' iron-wood, and the provisions consisted of
pigs, cocoanuts, bananas, and other tropical products. In this vessel
he sailed during the next four years to many islands of the Pacific, dis-
tribnting teachers among them, and doing everything' in his power for
the good of the people. In 1834 he visited England, and returned 1n
the 1n1ss1ona1 y ship Camden, which had been purchased by the London
Missionary Society.

Mr. Williams continued his work until 1839, when he, with a com-
panion missionary, James Harris, was murdered by the natives of the

 

COCOA PALMS IS THE "3|!va ISLANDS.

New Hebrides Islands, whither he had gone to plant a mission. The
stories of the conversion of the people of the Tonga, Samoan, and Feejee
groups is only scarcely less romantic than what has just been narrated
of the Hervey Isles. In all these islands, as well as in the Sandwich
and Society groups, it is probable that the proportion of the inhabitants
Who observe the Sabbath, attend divine service, and gather in their
families for morning and evening worship, is greater than among the
people of Great Britain or the United States.

In their intertribal wars, which sometimes occur in these days,
though far less frequently than before the advent of the missionaries,
all parties abstain from fighting on Sunday, and men may safely circu-
late from one hostile camp to another.

And all this has been accomplished through the sclf-abnegation of
the men who obeyed the divine injunction, " Go ye into all the world
and preach the Gospel to every creature." Volumes could be written,
as volumes have been written, but even then the whole story of the work
and sufferings of the missionaries in the South Seas would remain untold,

Referring to the opposition of the traders to the missionaries, Doc-
tor Bronson said that the death of Mr. Williams was due to the conduct
of the seamen, though it was not directly instigated by them.

"One of the products of the Pacific Islands," said the Doctor, "is
sandal-wood, which brings a high price in the Chinese market, and so
much has it been sought in the last fifty or sixty years that on many of
the islands it has entirely disappeared. The sandal-wood traders com-
mitted many outrages on the islands that they visited,'and these out-
rages naturally led to reprisals.

"When Mr. Williams and his friend landed on Erromanga, in the
New Hebrides, a party of warriors rushed upon them from a thicket
where they had been lying concealed. In an instant the missionaries
were clubbed, and their bodies were afterwards roasted and eaten by
the savages whom the devoted men sought to reclaim. Investigation
showed that a sandal-wood ship had visited the island a few weeks
before, and her crew had killed several of the natives who opposed
the plunder of their plantations and the destruction of their trees. Of
course the natives were ready to revenge themselves on the first foreign
ship that came there, and this happened to be the one carrying the mis--
sionaries.

"In 1871," continued the Doctor, "the death of Bishop Patteson
occurred on the island of Nukapu in much the same way. The bishop
was widely known and esteemed for his devotion to missionary work in
Polynesia, and was gleatly beloved by the natives on all the islands he
had visited Shortly before his visit to Nukapu a labor-vessel had been
there, and carriedofl' many of the natives against their will. I While
the natives were thirsting for revenge the bishop arrived, and, not know-
ing him, they put him to death, as the natives of Erromanga had killed
Mr. Williams more than thirty years before."LABOR--VESSEIlyS AND THE LABOR--TRADE. 113

"Please tell us something about the labor-vessels and the labor-
trade," said Frank. " I have read about them, and we heard them men-
tioned in Tahiti and Honolulu, and would like to know more about
them."

" It is quite a long story," was the reply, " but I'll try to give it to
you briefly. You remember that in the Hawaiian and Society islands
it was necessary to import foreign labor for the plantations, the natives
being too indolent, or not sufficiently numerous, for the wants of the
planters. Well, the same state of affairs prevailed, and still prevails, in
the Samoa, Feejee, Tonga, and other groups, where cotton and sugar
plantations have been established, and also in Queensland, in Australia.

 

NA'I'H'B uousns AND CANOE.

"Well, the demand naturally led to an effort to supply the want.
Labor-vessels went among the islands and groups farther to the west,
especially among the Solomon and New Hebrides islands, to hire men
to work on the plantations where they were needed.

"Nearly all of these vessels were English, either from the ports
of Australia or hailing from Feejee, Samoa, or Tahiti. Occasionally an
American captain went into the labor traific, and there was now and

then a French or German vessel engaged in it.
8
"The theory of the business was that men were hired on regular
contracts to work for a. period of years (from three. to five years) on
designated plantations, for certain stipulated wages, and at the end of
the contract they were to be returned to their homes free of expense to
themselves. Every man was to understand perfectly what was required
of him, and nobody was to be taken except of his own free-will.

" This was the theory and the practice at the outset, but very soon
the practice became far otherwise. Some men were hired on the above
plan, more were hired from their chiefs without being consulted as to
their own willingness in the matter, and a still greater number were
kidnapped and sold into slavery."

" Sold into slavery 2"

"Yes, exactly that. They were decayed on board the labor-ships,
and when a sufficient number were there they were bound hand and
foot, flung into the hold, and the ship sailed away with them. They
were delivered over to the planters at so much a head, and very few of
them ever found their way back again to their homes."

"Why, that's just like what we used to read about the African
slave-trade," said Fred, who had been listening with open-eyed aston-
ishment. V

"Quite so," the Doctor answered. "It was the revival of the Afri-
can slave-trade, and was carried on under the British flag. And many
of the men were taken into slavery on British soil as they were turned
over to the planters of Queensland, a British colony.

" The matter became so notorious that the attention of the British
Government was called to it, and measures were taken to put an end to
the outrages. Ships of war were sent to the South Pacific to suppress
the illegal trade, and stringent laws were passed to prevent further out.
rages. At present every labor-vessel must be licensed for her business, '
and carry an omcial who superintends the making of contracts, and
makes sure that every laborer signs the agreement with his own free-
will, and with a full understanding of the terms of the document. Care
is taken with regard to the food and treatment of the men while on
shipboard, and also when at work on the plantations."

Frank asked what were the means resorted to to obtain men before
the Government took these precautions.

' " As to that," was the reply, "the tricks and devices were various.
The usual plan was for a ship to anchor near an island, and of course
she was soon surrounded by the natives in their canoes, ready to barter
cocoanuts and other produce for what the white men had to sell. The '2.433 dam Frag "my. 2-- PS30: <

men were enticed on board, and when a sufficient number was on the
deck a signal was given by the captain, and the sailors would knock
the victims down as rapidly as possible. Some escaped by jumping
overboard, but the rest were secured, and the ship then proceeded to
another islandto' repeat the process
until her cargo was complete. Then,
with her hold packed'like that of an
African slave-ship fifty years ago,
she steered for Feejee or for Queens-
land, and the captain and crew made
a handsome profit for their work.

" After a time the natives became
too wary to be enticed on board in
the ordinary way, and then: other
plans were tried. The Southern.
07'088, the mission ship used by
Bishop Patteson, was painted white,
and the natives were familiar with
its appearance. Accordingly the
slavers adopted the following plan
to obtain their living cargoes:

"About the time the bishop was making his rounds at White vessel
appeared and anchored near an island. A boat put ofi for the shore,
and in its stern sat a blackcoated individual with a white necktie, green '
glasses, a book under his arm which would readily pass for a Bible, and
an umbrella over his head. The cry went around that the bishop had -
come, and the natives flocked to the beach to welcome him.

"Instead of the bishop it was a strange missionary, who spoke
enough of the language to make himself understood. He told them
that the bishop had had a fall the day before and broke his leg, and
therefore could not come on shore. He must hurry away to Sydney
to see a doctor, and could only stay a little while at the island, but he
wanted to see his friends on board, and would like some yams and fruit.

"In the course of an hour or so fifty or more canoes are flying over
the water laden with presents for the good bishop. The fruit is passed
on board, the men follow and are admitted two or three at a time, to
descend into the bishop's cabin.

"At the foot of the cabin-stairs they are met by half a dozen sailors,
who put pistols to their heads, threaten to kill them if they make the
least outcry, tie their hands, and pass them along into the hold through

a hole which has been cut from the cabin for that purpose. When a
batch has been thus disposed of another is allowed to descend, and in a
little while the hold is full; fifty or more natives have been made pris-
oners, and meantime the strange missionary has returned from shore,
the canoes are cut adrift or sunk by dropping pieces of iron into them,
and the pretended missionary ship sails away with a cargo of slaves for
the Queensland or Feejee market." '

 

FIRING DOWN THE HATCIIWAY.

"And was this really done by Englishmen?" one of the youths
asked.

" Yes, not only once, but several times," the Doctor answered; " and
of the men thus stolen from their homes very few ever found their way
back again. If you wish more information on this point, read ' Kidnap-
ping in the South Seas,' by Captain Palmer, and 'The Cruise of the
Raemvz'o,' by Captain Markham, both of the Royal Navy. These gen:
tlemen were sent to cruise in Polynesian waters to suppress the slave-
trade; and though they made several captures, they did not find them-
selves supported by the colonial courts. ' In two glaring instances,' says
Captain Markham, 'when slavers were seized and sent to Sydney for
adjudication they were acquitted, and their captors were themselves
condemned in heavy damages for detention and injury done to those
vessels.'

"A notorious case," continued the Doctor, " was that of the slaver
Carl, which has figured prominently in the newspapers and official doc-
uments. This vessel left Melbourne in June, 1871, for a cruise amongTHE MODERN SLAVE--TRADE. 119

the South Sea Islands, with the object of procuring laborers. Dr. James
Patrick Murray was on board as a passenger and part owner of the ves-
sel, which was commanded by Joseph Armstrong. They tried to obtain
laborers at the New Hebrides Islands by legitimate methods but failed,
and then they resorted unsuccessfully to the 'missionary trick.'

"After this the party captured the natives by upsetting or destroy-
ing their canoes. According to Dr. Murray's account, given on the
trial of. Armstrong and one of the crew, the captain and crew used to
smash the canoes by dropping pig--iron or stones into them, and the pas-
sengers in their own boat picked the natives out of the water,'sometimes
stunning them with clubs or slung-shot if they were troublesome.

 

TEX "nosmio'f misxxo A mus-mums scaoousn.

" In this way they collected about eighty natives, keeping them in
the hold at night, and allowing them to come on deck during the day.
One night there was a disturbance in the hold, and the natives tore
down the bunks, or sleeping-places, and with the materials thus obtained
they attacked the main hatchway.

"An attempt was made to- pacify them but it failed, and then the
crew began firing down the hatohway. The firing lasted about eight
hours, being kept up during the night, one of the men occasionally
throwing lights into the hold in order to enable the others to direct
their aim. At daylight all appeared to be quiet, and so the hatches
were opened and those who were alive were invited to come up. About
five came up without help; there were eight or nine seriously wounded,
sixteen badly wounded, and about fifty
dead. The dead and the sixteen badly
wounded were immediame thrown over-
board; the ship was out of sight of land at
the time, and therefore it was impossible
that any of the wounded could have reach-
ed the shore.

" The blood was removed from the hold,
all traces of the affair were eifaced, and
when the Carl was overhauled by the R0-
sa/m'o shortly afterwards there was nothing
. suspicious in her appearance, and she was

A "1er FOR THE "PENCIL allowed to proceed on her voyage.

" The captain and one of the crew were
condemned to death, but the sentence was afterwards commuted to im~
prisonment. Murray was allowed to be one of the witnesses for the
prosecution, and so escaped punishment. Others of the party on board
said Murray was the ringleader in the whole business, and that he
sang 'Marching through Georgia' while firing at the poor natives in
the hold. They further said that he selected those who were the least
wounded when the remainder were thrown overboard, and he used to
read prayers to the crew and then give the order to go and smash the

canoes of the natives."
"And all this happened in 1871," said Frank, "and was done by

Englishmen and under the English flag I"

" Yes," replied the Doctor; " and until the outrages became so noto-
rious that the attention of the civilized world was drawn towards them,
many official Englishmen in the British colonies were very lukewarm ,
on the subject, and evidently did not wish to impede the progress of the
cotton and sugar industries by interfering with the business of procur-
ing laborers. Let me give an instance of this:

" Captain Palmer, the predecessor of Captain Markham in command
of the Rosario, seized the schooner Daphne, of forty-eight tons burden,
fitted up exactly like an African slaver, and with one hundred natives

Markham. R. N.AN AUSTRALIAN COURT DECISION. 121

on board. They were entirely naked, had not even mats to sleep on, and
the hold of the schooner resembled a. pigpen more than anything else.

" The Daphne had a. license to carry fifty native 'passengers,' but it
made no mention of Feejee, where she was seized, and whither she had
taken her cargo for sale. The natives were landed at Levuka, Feejee,
and placed under the care of the British consul, and the Daplmw was
sent to Sydney for adjudication. The Chief-justice of New South Wales,
Sir Alfred Stephen, decided in the Daphne's favor in the following
words, which I will read from Cap-
tain Palmer's Book, 'Kidnapping in
the South Seas :'

" '. . . It will not be enough to show that
artifice has been used, or even falsehood told,
to induce the natives to enter into the agree-
ments or contracts mentioned, it they really
did enter into the contracts.

" 'Thc morality of the proceeding cannot
be taken into consideration in determining the
question raised here. The captor will have'
substantially to prove that the natives were
going to be passed into a state of real slavery
by those who had taken them on board the
Daphne, or were to be put into a state really
amounting to slavery, and in violation of the
agreement and against their will.'

" The Daphne was released, and
Captain Palmer was compelled to
pay the expenses of the trial, amount-
ing to nearly $900. This money was
afterwards refunded to him by Her
Majesty's Government, which ap-
proved his aetion in seizing the
schooner and placed his name on the mm," m, gunman" m "m_
list for promotion."

" How do the colonies obtain their laborers at present 3" Fred asked.

" They get them from the islands in legitimate ways, as I before
told you, and they also import Chinese and Indian coolies. The supply
of Polynesian labor is not equal to the demand, and in the last few
years, especially in Feejee, there has been a. large importation of coolies
from India. We will learn something about them when we visit the
Feejee Islands."

THE Pem reached the Samoan Islands without mishap, and anch-
ored in the harbor of Apia. The Samoan group is also known
on charts and maps as the Navigator's Islands; the former name is
the native one, while the latter was bestowed by Bougainville in 17 68,
who called the group Archipel deg vaigatcws, in consequence of the
skill displayed by the natives in managing their canoes. There are
nine inhabited islands in the group,
with an area of about 1125 square
miles and a population of something
less than forty thousand.

In general effect our friends found
the scenery of Samoa not unlike that
of Tahiti, though the detail was mate-
rially different. The harbor of Apia
is an excellent one, affording secure

slums mum: we>>. anchorage and safety from all winds;

the captain of the yacht told Frank

that there was a finer harbor at Pailgo'-Pango, in another island, but

Apia was the most important commercially. The trading company

that succeeded the German house of Godefroy & Sons, after the lat-

ter's failure, has a large establishment at Apia, and controls a great

part of the business of the islands. The ship-yard of the company

was pointed out, and it needed only a glance to show that it was ex-
tensive and well equipped.UNDER THE OCEAN WAVE. - ' 123

Apia consists of a long and rather straggling village, stretched along
the shore of a crescent-shaped bay; like most of these South Sea island
ports, it is concealed by the cocoa palms and other trees peculiar to
the tropics,'and many of the houses are so well covered by the verdure
that the visitor cannot make out
their position until he is close upon
them.

Back of the town, which con-
tains two or three hundred stores
and residences, the horizon is filled
with richly green hills, which rise
one upon the other to a height of
nearly five thousand feet. Streams
come trickling down from these
hills, and there is one water-fall
visible from the harbor large '-

Frank and Fred immediately sug-

outcasts from decent society or society of any kind, and not at all
particular as to how they make a living. They were more numerous
fifty years ago than at present, but there is still a sufficient number of
them for all practical wants of the country. In the days when Eng-
land sent its criminal classes to Australia, the South Sea Islands were
filled with escaped convicts and ticket-of-leave men; but that source of
supply no longer abounds, and thereby hangs a tale which may as well
be told here as anywhere else.

 

GROWTH 0? COM). 0)! A MOUNTAIN SLOWLY SUBSIDINO.

" The first white settlers of the Feejee Islands was a band of twenty-
seven convicts, who escaped from imprisonment in New South Wales,
in 1804, on a small schooner which they had captured. They landed in
Feejee with a few muskets, and in their encounters with the natives
their weapons made them all-powerful. The natives regarded the mus-
kets as something supernatural, and if the white men had conducted
themselves with intelligence they could have obtained mastery over
the whole pbpulation with very little trouble. The natives were ready
to acknowledge them as rulers, and did in fact exalt several of them to
the position of chiefs. But the fellows quarrelled with the natives and
among themselves, and when Commodore Wilkes touched at the Fee
jees, in 1840, only two of them were alive.

"These wandering or stationary vagabonds are the men who are
called beach-combers in the parlance of the South Pacific. They are
not fond of law and order, and whenever an island group goes under
the control of any- European power the beach-combers are very likely
to leave and take up their abode on islands where the natives are still
independent. When the French occupied Tahiti many beach-combers
there fled to Feejee, and when Feejee became an English colony they
departed for Samoa. Samoa is still under the rule of its own kings, or
rather under their misrule, but the probabilities are that it will soon be
in the hands of the Germans. When this happens you may expect an
emigration of beach- combers to the islands, if any remain, where there
will be no legal restraints

 

ASS'S EARS, FLORIDA. ISLAND.

"The stories of many of these fellows is full of the most startling
incidents, even after making a. very liberal deduction for what their '
imaginations have added to the facts as they occurred. One of them
tells how, when he landed in Feejee, he was condemned to be baked and.
served up at a feast; the oven was being heated for his reception when
the chief concluded to keep his prize a while longer until he could be
fattened. The man was released, but he ate sparingly of the food that
was given him, and at the same time ingratiated himself with the
natives, particularly with the chief, by showing him how to make war
successfully upon his enemies. The result was he was saved from bak-
ing, became a man of importance, had fifty wives, and a goodly number
of slaves. '

"Another beach-somber named Charley Savage became a man of
great importance, and received the honors that were given to the most
exalted chiefs. He assisted his tribe in making war, and was nearly al-
ways successful. One day, however, his fortune deserted him, as he was
killed in a fight, and his body fell into the hands of his enemies. They
cooked and devoured him. and made his bones into sail needles, whichNATIVE TROUBLES 1N SAMOA. 127,

were. distributed among the people in token of the event, and as a
remembrance of the victory in which he was slain.

"It must not be supposed from this reference to cannibalism that
the Samoans practised it. They seem never to have been addicted to
devouring their enemies or anybody else, and in other respects were
superior to their neighbors.

." Like nearly all these island groups, Samoa. has been, from time
immemorial, the scene of almost constant warfare between the tribes
inhabiting the different islands. There are generally two or three
claimants to the throne of Samoa, and the foreign consuls are kept
pretty busy adjusting difficulties growing out of the local wars, and
involving the destruction of foreign property. On two occasions the

protectorate of the islands has been offered to the United States, but it
has been declined with thanks. It has also been oifered to England, but
thus far has not been accepted, and the indications, at the time of this
writing, are that Samoa. will be a. German colony before many months.*

 

* Since the above was written Samoa has virtually passed into the hands of the Ger-
mans. The former King was deposed, taken on board a German war-ship, and carried
into exile in New Guinea. A new king was placed on the throne. and is maintained there
by A German garrison stationed at Apia.
" The Samoans have been divided into two great factions, and it has
never been possible for them to come to an agreement that could be
kept for any length of time. Their quarrels have been aided by the
scoundrelly white men just mentioned, and our consul says that if all
these bad fellows could be driven out there might be a chance for

eace.

P "It was these beach-combers that in the early days of the labors of
the missionaries greatly hindered their work, and in several instances
directly caused their deaths. As an illustration I may mention the
death of the first three English missionaries who went to the Tonga
Islands. There was an escaped English convict living there who per-
suaded the King that these men were wizards, and that an epidemic
which was then raging had been caused by them. The King accord-
ingly murdered the good men at the bidding of the scoundrel.

" When the first missionaries settled in Pango-Pango, in Samoa, some
twelve or fifteen of these beach-combers were living there. These ras-
cals were so bitterly opposed to the missionaries that they tried to drive
them away, and failing in this laid a plot to poison them. The story is
thus told by Rev. Mr. Murray in his book, 'Forty Years of Mission
Work in Polynesia :'

" 'The plot was wellnigh carried into execution. The opportunity was to he em-
braced when the teskettle was on the fire. Cooking and boiling of water are carried on
in open sheds on the islands. The time fixed upon for carrying the plan into effect was
scrubs afternoon. The lad who attended to the boiling of the water was accustomed to
fill the kettle and put it upon the fire before going to the service. Hence there was
aiforded the opportunity which our enemies sought. We had all gone to the service, and
there was no human eye to watch their movements. The appointed afternoon happened
to be windy, and while the man who had undertaken to carryzthe plot into efiect was in
the act of doing the deed, another, who had been smitten with remorse, struck his arm
and scattered the poison; they had no means of obtaining more. and so the attempt failed.
The man who was instrumental in saving our lives remained on the island several years
acting as pilot to vessels entering Pango-Pnngo harbor, and in 1841 he left in our mission-
ary brig Omnden. It was not from himself that we learned'our obligations but from
another while men who lived on the island at the time of the plot, and knew of it though
he had no hand in it. The occurrence led to the breaking up and scattering of the party

of would-be murderers. as they feared the arrival of a man-of-war, and they could no lon-
ger trust one another.'

" The Samoans are a handsome people," continued Frank in his jour-
nal, "of a deep bronze or copper color, and graceful figures. Some of
them have adopted foreign garments; but a good proportion adhere to
the native dress, which consists of fine mats or thick handsome tappa,
made from the fibre of the mulberry or bread-fruit tree. Their tappaAPPEARANCE AND DRESS OF THE SAMOANS. 129

is thicker than that of the Marquesas, but unfortunately the manufact-
ure of it is diminishing year by year, and in a little while no more will
be made. Foreign calicoesare taking its place, just as in Tahiti and the
Marquesas. Of course the foreigners wish a market for the goods they
have to sell, and therefore they encourage the wearing of garments or
' materials of European make.-

" The most lightly clad
Samoans were those that
came out in boats when we
lay at anchor and wanted
to dive for money. They
are excellent swimmers
and (livers, and when a
piece of silver is thrown
into the water they are
after it instantly, and catch
it before it reaches the bot
tom. The best of the di-
rers was: a girl who ap-
peared to be about fifteen .
years old; when she caught
a coin she held it between
her teeth till she rose to
the surface, and after tak-
ing breath for half a min-
ut/e or so was ready for
another dive. The per- > g 7 _

what we saw at Singa-
pore, Malta, and other ports, where there are always plenty of natives
ready to dive for the coins that passengers throw over for them. The
water'is perfectly clear, and-though it is fully a hundred feetdeep,
every object on the bottom can be seen,

" In our stroll about Apia. we passed the convent where:four French
Sisters and'as many Samoan ones have charge of the education of some
sixty or more native girls, many of them the daughters of chiefs or be-
longing to the high caste families. 'As we passed the convent the girls
were singing very sweetly, and we paused to listen; it was easy to im-
agine that we were passing a school in Rouen or Dijon, so much was
the singing like what one hears in France. The French Sisters are said

9
to be very much devoted to their work, and as the Samoans are fond of
music they readily receive instruction in singing. The girls are taught
in all the branches customary in schools of this sort in other parts of
the world; sewing and other home duties are not neglected, and when
the pupils leave the school they are in a. position to do a great deal of
good among their less accomplished sisters.

"There is a similar school for boys, under the charge of French
priests, and there are Protestant schools in every village. The Catho-
lics have made greater progress here than in any other of the island
groups; they have between three and four' thousand adherents, and
among their. converts are some of ,the most influential men of the isl-
ands. The representatives of the London Missionary Society claim
about twenty-five thousand followers, and the Methodists something
more than five thousand, the latter having come into the field much
later than did the London society. Nearly all the adult population can
read and write, and there is scarcely a child ten years old that cannot
read its own language.

"There are groves of cocoanut-trees everywhere, and we were not
surprised to learn that the principal product. of the islands is from the
cocoa-tree. Ten thousand tons of copra are shipped every year to the '
markets of Europe, where the oil is extracted, and there is besides a
large production of cocoanut-oil in Samoa, which some have estimated
as high as two thousand tons. The Germans have extensive cotton
plantations, and there are smaller plantations belonging to English and
American companies and individuals; coffee and sugar are cultivated,
but the culture of these articles has not thus far been very extensive.

"As at Tahiti and in the other islands, it has been necessary to im-
port laborers from elsewhere to work the plantations, as the Samoans
are not fond of exerting themselves any more than are those of the So-
ciety group. Thus far most of the laborers have been imported by the
Germans, and they come from all the islands where the German vessels
trade. The Polynesian Land Company and the American Land Com-
pany have also made some i'mportations of the same sort, but up to the
present time they have not equalled the Germans.

"While walking in the outskirts of the town we were thirsty, and
asked the native boy who accompanied us where we could find some ,
water to drink. He immediately suggested coconnut-milk, and on our
acquiescing he hailed a boy who was lounging under a cocoanut-tree
close by, and said something to him in Samoan.

" Immediately the second boy teak a. small piece of rope which had
MA? 01" THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDQ

been twisted out of cocoa. fibre, and prepared to ascend one of the trees.
By means of this rope and his hands and feet he went up about as
quickly as we could have ascended a staircase of the same height, and
threw down several nuts, with which we quenched our thirst. Any one
who has been in the tropics knows how refreshing is the milk of the
green cocoanut when he is weary and thirsty.

 

CRABS EATING COCOANUTS-

"We saw some crabs feeding on eocoanuts, which are about the
last thing in the world you would suppose a crab could eat. Perhaps
you'll laugh and be incredulous, but they really do eat cocoanuts, and
get the meat out without any assistance. Cocoanuts are their principal
food, but they do not refuse other fruits, such as figs, candle-nuts, and
nutmegs. This Is the way they do it:

" The crab climbs a tree and pushes down a. ripe cocoanut, which is
easily detached, and he shows a. great deal of sagacity in selecting only
the ripe nuts. Then he comes down to the ground and tears the husk
from the nut, and he always begins at the end where the eye-holes are.LAND-CRABS IN SAMOA. 133

If the tree is a sloping one, and there are rocks underneath, he climbs
up again, carrying the nut with him, and drops it on a rock, where it
will be broken. If the situation is not favorable for this performance,
he digs into the eye-holes until he makes an entrance sufficiently large
to admit his pincers, with which he withdraws the meat.

"These landcrabs are excellent eating, though they are rather too
oily for a. delicate stomach. They live in large holes, which they dig
themselves and line With the fibre torn from the cocozmut-shell. They
grow to a great size, and sometimes 'a single "crab willyield-a quart of

use the sea to bathe in. We asked our guide if all crabs in Samoa are
good to eat, and he answered that all land-crabs were, but the sea, ones
were doubtful, some of them being poisonous at certain seasons of the
year.
"We went into some of the native houses, and found them neat and
clean. The roofs of the houses are very high, and supported on low
posts; Fred said there was a great deal of roof and very little wall, and
this exactly describes a Samoan house. The roof is thatched with palm-
leaves, and when well and properly laid will exclude the heaviest rains.
The houses have no doors,
mats being suspended at
the entrance; the result is,
the dogs and chickens may
walk in when they choose,
though in many houses the
chickens are not allowed
to enter. '

" It is the custom to
place screens of plaited
palm-leaves around the
houses at night, but they
.. V , .. . are always removed at

A mm mm daylight. In the interior

of -the houses screens of

cloth are suspended from the roof to divide the space into rooms where

the inmates sleep. The couches are piles of fine mats of cocoa fibre,

and the pillows are simply sticks of bamboo or other wood, on which

the neck, not the head, is rested. It is about as uncomfortable as the

Japanese pillow, which it closely resembles, and is no doubt the cause
of the early-rising habits of the natives.

" All the cooking is done out-of-doors, and there is very little inside
the houses that can be called furniture. In one house we found a. group
of young people playing a game which was something like our game of
forfeits. They sat in a circle and spun a cocoanut around on its sharp _
end; when it fell the person towards whom the three black eyes point-
ed was adjudged the loser. When they are to decide which of them is
to do anything, leaving the others free, the lottery of the cocoanut is
used to determine the matter.

" Warfare being more prevalent here in later years than in the Soci-
ety group, we found the games of the young men much more vigorous
than at Tahiti. We saw a party of boys playing at totoga, or reed-
throwing; they had reeds five or six feet long, with points of hard
wood, and the skill of the game consisted in making the reeds skim as
far as possible along the grass.GAMES or THE YOUNG PEOPLE. 135

"In another spot some young men were throwing spears at the
stumps of trees, and in this game the skill consisted in a youth's ability
to force out the spear of some one else while fixing his own in the
stump. They have several games in which spears and clubs are used,
and sometimes they are accompanied by a good deal of risk. Spears
are thrown so as to hit the ground and then glide upward to the mark,
and sometimes a man stands up armed with only a club and allows ha"
a dozen others to throw
their spears at him in rapid
succession. By a dexter-
ous handling of his club he
turns the spears aside, but
it is evident that the slight
est mistake may have se-
rious consequences.

"When we came back
to the landing-place we
thought we Would take a
ride in a native boat in-
stead of calling away the
boat of the yacht. So we
hired an outrigger canoe,
and were quickly paddled
to the side of the Para.
These boats are not by
any means new to us, as
we have seen them in Cey-
lon, the Malay Archipela
go, and other parts of the
world. The Samoans han~
dle them with a great deal
of skill, and I do not won-
der that Bougainville recog-
nized their ability by call-
ing this group the 'Navi-- ""E*""""'T-
gator's Islands.'

" I forgot to say," added Frank, "that we saw several cases-of ele-
phantiasis, which the natives call fefe, and is said to be quite common
in all the islands of the group. The arms and legs of the victims are
swollen to a great size, but, happily for them, the disease is not attended
with pain. The cause of fefe is as unknown as is that of goitre in '
Switzerland."

Apia is on the north side of Upolu Island, which is the most impor-
tant and the most populous of the group. It has an area of about three
hundred and thirty~five square miles, and a. population of not far from
fifteen thousand, or more than one-third the entire number of inhabi-
tants of Samoa. In the middle of the island is a chain of broken hills
sloping towards the sea, and these hills up to their very tops are green
with verdure. The harbor of Apia is sheltered by a natural break-
water; but, though the principal seat of commerce, it is not considered
as fine as that of PangePango, on Tutuila Island, whither our friends
proceeded when their inspection of Upolu was completed.

'The day after their arrival at Apia they made an excursion to Malua,
about twelve miles distant, to see the college of the London Mission,
which is located at that point. Of this journey Fred wrote as follows:

"We hired a boat with six strong natives to row it, but they didn't
have much to do, as the wind favored us both ways, and the greater
part of the distance we were under sail. The journey seemed a very
short one, as we were busy studying the scenery, which is very pretty
and changed every few minutes as the valleys opened to our gaze and
revealed their wonderful richness of tropical productions. We kept a _
sharp watch for the college buildings, but didn't see them until we were
quite close to the village.

"The fact is the college is not a huge edifice such as you find in
Europe or America, but a collection of fifty or sixty one--story cottages,
which are built around a large square, with a hall or class-room at one
side. In another respect it is unlike. a college in civilized countries, as
each student is generally accompanied by his wife and family; we were
told that married men were preferred to single ones, as the wife and
children could be educated at the same time that the student pursued
his studies, and they are useful afterwards in instructing the women
and children in the places to which they are assigned.

"Every cottage has a garden attached to it, which the student is
required to cultivate sufficiently to support his family. Any surplus 4
stock he raises is sold and placed to his credit, and nearly all the stu-
dents feed and clothe their families out of the proceeds of the garden.
The college was founded in 1844 by Doctor G. A. Turner; it has edu-
cated more than two thousand teachers and preachers, and in conse-
quence of the system I have just mentioned is almost self supporting.
There are several thousand cocoanut, bread-fruit, and other lifesupport--A SAMOAN MISSIONARY COLLEGE. 137

ing trees on the grounds, while the gardens are devoted to taro, yams,
bananas, and similar plants. Here, as elsewhere in the South Pacific,
the bananaplant is very productive, and requires comparatively little
labor to take care of it.

"The rules of the institution are very strict, and any student who
repeatedly disobeys them is requested to make way for some one who
will not. The bell rings at daylight for morning prayers, after which
the students go to work in their gardens or at their trades, or fish in the
lagoon in front of the settlement. At eight o'clock the bell rings again
for bath and breakfast, and at nine it summons the classes for recita-
tion and instruction, which continue until four in the afternoon. Then
more work till sunset, when the bell calls to family prayer. After this
the students study by themselves till nine o'clock, when the bell tells
them to extinguish their lights and go to bed.

 

WAR CANOE 01' THE OLDBN THIR.

"The majority of the students are Samoans; the rest are from all
the islands of the South Pacific, whence they have been sent by the
local missionaries. They study arithmetic, geography, and of course
learn to read and Write, and besides these ordinary branches of educa-
tion they devote considerable time to the Scriptures and to theology.

"Every Saturday evening there is a prayer-meeting, at which the
students make short exhortations. On Sunday there are three services
--morning, afternoon, and evening; and there are Sunday-schools for
the children and Bible classes for the older folks. On the first Sunday
of each month there is a communion-service, after the manner of
churches in England and other civilized lands. We have not seen any-
where in the Pacific a. finer assemblage of native men and women than

the class at this college; they had bright, intelligent faces, and we were
told that they were all so anxious to progress in their studies that they
rarely infringed any of the rules of the institution, the one most fre-
quently violated being that which required them to stop studying at
nine o'clock and go to bed.

"It was getting quite dark when we returned to Apia. and found
our old quarters on the yacht. They wanted us to stay all night at the
mission school; but there were so many of us that we thought it best to
come back to Apia. lest we might incommode our hosts by thrusting
such a large number of visitors on them at once. You may be sure we
slept soundly in our cabins, as we were all thoroughly tired out with
the long but very interesting excursion."

After a few days at Apia the yacht proceeded to Pango-Pango, in
Tutuila Island, a. distance of about eighty miles. Under her steam-
power she made the journey in a single day; had she relied on her
sails it would have been far different, as Tutuila. lies dead to windwardTHE HARBOR or PANGO--PANGO. 139

of Upolu, and there are several currents which add their force to make
a passage diflicult. Sailing-vessels are often five or six days making
this trip, which can be covered in. a few hours by steam.

Our young friends thought they had never seen anywhere at more.
beautiful harbor than this; Frank sat down to describe it, and after
writing a few lines said he would abandon the attempt, and fall back
upon the account of Admiral Wilkes, who visited it in 1839. Accord-
ingly he copied the following from the history of the famous expedi-
tiou:

"The harbor of Pango-Paugo is one of the most singular in all the Polynesian isles.
It is the last point at which oue would look for a shelter; the coast near it is peculiarly
rugged, and has no appearance of indentations, and the entrance being narrow, is not easily
observed. Its shape has been . -
compared to a variety of arti-
cles; that which it most nearly
resembles is a. retort. It is sur-
rounded on all sides by inacces-
sible mural precipicea, from eight
hundred to one thousand feet in
height. The lower part of these
rocks is bare, but they are clothed
above with luxuriant vegetation.
Bo impassable did the rocky bur-
rier appear in all but two places,
that the harbor was likened to
the valley of 'Rasselas' changed
' to a lake. The harbor is of easy
access, and its entrance. which is
about a third of a mile in width,
is marked by the Tower Rock
and the Devil's Point."

"He might have add-
ed," said F rank, " that
there is a. coral reef on '
eaph side of the entrance,
with the surf breaking
. heavily over it, or at any
rate it was doing so at
the time we entered. Pan-
go-Pango'is a splendid harbor, and could hold a great many ships. Its
principal disadvantage is that the prevailing trade-wind blows directly
into it, so that while 'a sailingship can get in without much trouble she
has a hard time to get out unless she has asteam tow-boat to help her."

 

CAPTAIN JAXRS COOK.
Doctor Bronson told the youths that at one time the King of Samoa
proposed to present the harbor of Pango-Pango, and an area of land sur-
rounding it, to the United States Government for a coaling and naval
station; but as the acceptance of the proposal would involve political re
lations that might be troublesome in future, the
offer was practically declined. The commerce
of Pango-Pango is not as important as that of
Apia, for the very simple reason that the island.
of Tutuila contains only four thousand inhabit-
ants, and their productive energies are not great.
Copra and cocoanutoil are the principal articles
, of export; there are some small plantations dc-
: voted to cotton, sugar, or coffee, but the lack of
native laborers and the high cost of imported
ones has kept these industries in a backward

AN mums mamas-r. . state.

The first European vessel to enter this bar-
bor was the Eh'zabeth, an English Whaler, commanded by Captain Outh-
bert. He gave it the name of Cuthbert Harbor, but the appellation
never adhered to it. Pango-Pango is.its native name, and will prob-
ably be maintained long after Cuthbert is quite forgotten.

The settlement at Pango-Pango was so much like the one at Apia
that we will not risk wearying the reader with a description, Suffice
it to say the yacht remained two or three days there, and then prc>>
ceeded on her voyage in the direction of the Feejee Islands.

Before their departure they were invited to attend a. Fa-Samoa V
party, and the invitation was promptly accepted. Frank asked what a_'
FavSamoa party was. '

" You might put it in French," said the American consul, by iwhom
the invitation was given, "and say a la Samoa, or, to come to'-'plain
English, you may render it 'Samoan fashion.' ' FaSamoa,' ' FaFeejee,' -
or 'Fa-Tonga,' mean after the manner of Samoa, Feejee, or Tonga. It
is a convenient feature of the language, and I can assure you the party
will be an enjoyable one."

"The consul was right," said Frank, in telling their experience, "as
the party was a jolly one. It reminded us of the dinner at Tahiti after
the native style, but was more like a picnic than anything else we have
at home. In fact it was a good deal of a picnic, as each person who
was invited contributed something to the supply of eatables for the table,
so that those who did not fancy the native dishes need not go hungry.A k'A--SAMOA PARTY. 1'11

," The picnic ground was just outside the town, on a pretty bit of
lawn shaded by grand old bread-fruit and cocoanut trees, and in the
midst of a grove of bananas, which extended on three sides of the lawn
and served as a. sort of hedge. Bananaleaves were spread thickly on
the grass, and on this lowly table the edible things were spread, and
what do you suppose we had to eat? '

"We had sucking~pigs roasted very much as they are roasted at
home, or folded in taro-leaves and baked in hot ashes; the steam from
the green leaves cooks them thoroughly, so that the joints fall apart at
the merest tonoh of the knife, or a. slight strain of the fingers. They
gave us pigeons 'cookcd the same way, and I remark, by-the-way, that

 

CATB NEAR THE PlCNlC GROUND.

there are pigeons in the Samoan Islands, and it is one of the native pas-
times to catch them. We had several kinds of scale-fish, some cooked
and others raw, and we had crawfish and prawns and Samoan oysters;
but I'm bound to say I didn't think much of the oysters when I remem-
bered those of my native land. They gave us a. salad made of the
young and tender shoots of the cocoa-tree, and Very nice it was, and
everywhere we turned there were bananas, oranges, pineapples, and
othe1 t1opical fruits.

"The dishes that most attracted our attention were the puddings
made of bananas, b1ead- fruit, tam, and similar things. The consul told
us that each' of the ingredients was beaten fine and baked separately,
and then they were all worked in together and covered with the thick
cream from a ripe cocoanut. Cocoanut-cream is wonderfully rich;
when taken by itself it is apt to cloy the stomach and disturb digestion,
but used as a sauce for the puddings it is delicious; but you must touch
it sparingly, as it is full of oil.

" We sat on the ground to partake of the feast, and had a back- ache
afterwards, just as we did in Tahiti. F01 drink we each had a freshly
opened cocoanutshell, and we took the cocoamilk as we would take
tea or any other beverage in civilized lands. There were some cakes
made of putrid bread-fruit, but we did not touch them any more than
we did the equally vile-smelling Limburger cheese which one of our
entertainers had brought along. The bread-fruit is in season for about
half the year; the natives store the fruit in pits lined with banana-

leaves, and thus stored the stuff fermeuts, and soon smells so badly that

any person with a sensitive nose cannot bear to come within odorifer-
ous distance. When walking where there are any of these bread-fruit
pits we always try to keep to windward.

"Taste and habit are everything. The Germans are nanseated by
putrid bread-fruit, while the Samoans are equally intolerant of Lim-
bnrger. They are horrified when told how long game is kept in Eng-
land and America before being cooked and eaten, and the merest taste
of Worcestershire sauce would spoil their appetites for a whole day at
least."

The course of the yacht carried her near Massacre Bay, and Fred
naturally inquired why the spot was so called.

"It was so named," replied Doctor Bronson, "because of the mas-
sacre of several of the crew, together with the captain, of the Astrolalae,
one of the ships of La Perouse, the illvfated navigator whose death
was so long a mystery."

" What were the circumstances of the affair l" was the inquiry
which followed this explanation.

"The ships of La Perouse, the Boussolo (compass) and Astrolalw
(quadrant), were oil the island, and Captain De Lange, who commanded
the Ash-olabe, sent four boats on shore to procure water. They carried

The boats made their way through the reef, and reached the beach
without opposition. While the work of watering was going on the na-
tives appeared friendly enough, until suddenly they gave a loud shout,
and attacked the Frenchmen with stones and clubs. Captain De
Lange was killed, and with him eleven of his men. The rest escaped
to the ships, leaving one of their boats aground. La Perouse endeav-
ored to get inside the reef to punish the natives, but after several days
he gave up the attempt and proceeded to Botany Bay, whence he sent
an account of the affair to his government."

" And that was the last heard of him for a long time ?"

"Yes; he sailed from Botany Bay with the Boussole and Ash'olaba
in March, 1788, and for thirty-eight years nothing was known of him
or his ships, or what became of them."

 

"ASS-"Jul DAY.

fate?"
"Oh, certainly" They sent an expedition to the South Seas, but it

returned without the least information. Then they sent a circular to
ambassadors, consuls, and other officials, at the courts of all the powers
of the world, and to scientific societies and commercial associations,
asking them in the name of humanity to search for any trace of the
missing expedition, and ofiering to reward any one who rendered assist-
ance to survivors, or gave any information about the fate of La Perouse

and his companions."
"And it took thirty-eight years to get the desired information?"

"Yes. All inquiries of navigators and others came to nothing, and
gradually the fate of La Peronse was considered a, problem impossible
of solution. On the 13th of May, 1826, an English trading--ship from.
Calcutta, the St. Patrick, Captain Peter Dillon, touched at the island of

there." ' '

Frank and Fred eagerly seanned the map, and by following the lines
of latitude and longitude they speedily located Tuoopia. It is between
the Solomon and New Hebrides groups, and lies nearly due north-west
from the Feejees, and a. little north of west from Samoa.

man named Martin Bucheit, whom he had known at the Feejees thir-

one; and so much was Dillon absorbed with it, that he did not at firstCAPTAIN DILLON'S DISCOVERY. 145

notice'a silver sword-hilt which the Lascar wore suspended by a string
around his neck. While he was talking with Buchert, the Lascar sold
the sword-hilt to the ship's armor-er for a few fish-hooks. The natives
that swarmed around the ship had many articles of European manufact-
ure, and questions concerning them led to a remark about the sword-
hilt, which was speedily obtained again from the armorer.

"Captain Dillon learned that the things were brought from an
island called Vanikoro, about two days' sail to leeward of Tucopia, and
that the natives there had many articles of European manufacture,

which were obtained from two ships that had been wrecked there long
before.

"Captain Dillon thought of La Perouse, and of the reward which
the French Government offered. Then he bought all the European
articles which the natives of Tucopia possessed, and as soon as this was
done he made sail for Vanikoro. _

"When his ship was under way he carefully examined the sword-
hilt with a magnifying-glass. There was a monogram so badly worn
that the letters were indistinct, but he finally made it out ' J. F. G. P.'
--the initials of the name Jean Francois Galaup de la Perouse.

" He had found the hilt of the great navigator's sword!"

" And what did he find at Vanikoro ?" said one of the youths,
eagerly.

" Owing to contrary winds," the Doctor replied, " he was unable to
visit the island at that time, and returned to Calcutta without doing
so. He reported his discovery, and exhibited the sword-hilt and other
relics; the East India Company fitted out a ship and placed it under his
command, and he proceeded to Vanikoro, where he obtained a great

unharmed. They built a. small vessel from the wreck of the larger one,

those who remained on the island diedpone after another, and it is sup-
posed that the last survivor perished only a few months before the

" The French Government kept its promise. It created him a chev-
alier of the Legion of Honor, gave him a life pension of four thousand

returned to England, and lived on his pension until his death in 1846.""THE CANNIBAL ISLES." _ 14:7

URING the voyage to the Feejees Frank and Fred informed them-
selves ooncerning that famous group of islands, which formerly
had a dark reputation
for being the scene of
the grossest forms of
cannibalism. What
they learned was sub-
stantially as follows:
"There is really no
such group of islands
as 'The Feejees;' the
word Feejee comes
from Viti, or Vee-tee
--Viti Levu being the
largest island of the
group, which consists
of something more
than two hundred ile '
ands and islets. The
number is variously
placed at from two
hundred to two hun-
dred and fifty, and of . . - .
these about one hun- ' V ' 3",, u
dred and forty are in- L/
habited. Viti Levu A MM 0? W-
measures about ninety-seven miles from east to west and sixty-four
-from north to south, and its area is computed at 4112 square miles.
VanuarLevu, with an area of nearly 2500 miles, is the next largest, and
then come Taviuni and Kandavu, the former of 217 square miles, and
the latter of 124. None of the other
islands have areas equalling one hundred
square miles, and it would be tedious to
name them all.

"Altogether the Feejee group has an
area estimated at 7400 square miles, or
about 400 square miles less than that of
the State of Massachusetts. Its popula-
tion is estimated 9.

Fred was about to write 200, 000,
taking the figures f1om a book before
him, when he was interrupted by Doc
tor Bronson.

"Wait a moment," said the Doctor,
" and I'll tell you something on that sub-
ject. A new. annfimur.

"Twenty or twenty-five years ago,"
he continued, "the population was estimated at fully that figure, and
some authorities put it as high as 250,000. Of course there has never
been a careful census, and in the interior of the larger islands it is not
easy to get-even a close approximation of the number of inhabitants.
Since the occupation of the islands by the Whites the population has
followed the general law of all Polynesia, and diminished with more or
less steadiness.

" In 1874: it was estimated that it had been reduced to 180, 000, and
in the following year fully one-- -third of this number died PS10m the
scourge of measles."

"Measles!" exclaimed Frank and Fred, in astonishment. "I didn't
know," Frank added, " that this disease was a deadly one."

"It is not usually so considered in civilized lands," the Doctor an-
swered, "nor would it have been so here but for the ignorance of the
people, and their persistence in doing exactly what they should not
have done.

"In the latter part of 1874: Thakombau, King of Feejee, and his
sons went to Sydney in an English man-of-war, to pay their respects
to the Governor of New South Wales. At Sydney the two youngestFEEJEEANS KILLED OFF BY MEASLES. 149

boys took measles, but the disease showed itself in such a mild form
that nothing was thought of it. On the return voyage in J anuary the
King had a, slight attack, but it was considered of no consequence, and
on his arrival at Levuka. he went ashore at once.

" His relatives and subjects came to pay their respects, and accord-
ing to custom smelt of his hands or his face, and thus took in the poi-
son of the disease. A few days after his arrival there was a meeting of
chiefs and other high dignitaries from all the tribes of the group, and
the same ceremonies were 'gone through. In this way the disease was
spread through the group, and when it developed it caused the death of
nearly every chief who had attended the ceremonial.

 

ANCIENT FEDEX TEMPLE
" All through the Feejees people died by the thousand; in some
instances Whole villages were struck down, and there were not enough
well people to care for the sick or bury the (lead. Medical directions
were published and sent abroad as soon as possible, but the superstitious
people had been told by some of the beach-combers and other scoun-
drels infesting the islands that the disease had been imported in or-
der to kill them 06 and get their lands, and that the medicines of the
white men were intended to spread rather than check it. The medical
directions were ignored; some tribes who had become Christian re-
nounced the new religion and drove out their teachers. In one instance
where a teacher died of measles his Christian disciples concluded that it
was best to follow the old custom and bury his wife and children with
him, in order to propitiate. the demon of the scourge."

"Why was the disease so fatal here when it is not so in our own
country?" one of the youths inquired.

"You are aware, I presume," the Doctor answered, "that care should
be exercised in measles against taking cold, and thus driving the dis-
ease to the lungs. These people are continually bathing, and it was the
most natural thing in the world for them to rush to the cooling streams
as soon as the fever came on them. In this way thousands doomed
themselves to death, and besides, there came an unusual rainfall that
converted great areas of country into swamps, and rendered it impossi-
ble for the people to keep dry even if they had tried to do so.

"As an illustration of the effect of bathing, I may mention the
case of the native police at Levuka. A hundred and fifty men were
seized with measles, and the officer in charge, an Englishman, immedi-
ately established a hospital and ordered those who were least aflected
to care (for the rest. They were forbidden to bathe or allow any one
else to do so; all the patients recovered except ten, and of these every
man was found to have disobeyed orders and indulged in a bath in the
tempting sea which was close by.

"An English resident says that whole villages were swept away
by the scourge, the dead were buried in their own houses, and to this
day many of the platforms on which the Feejeean houses are built are
simply family tombs. The coast towns suffered more than those of
the interior, probably in consequence of their being in more swampy
ground, and thus more afiected by the dampness. The measles were
afterwards carried to other groups, where the effect was severe, but not
so fatal in proportion to the population as in the Feejees."

With this explanation Frank put down the number of native in-BOTUMAH ISLAND. 151

habita-nts of the Feejees at 120,000; afterwards he obtained at, Suva
the figures of the census of .1884, which wereas follows: European
residents, 3513; native Feejeeans, 115,635; Polynesian laborers, 5634;
Asiatics, about 5000; and Rotumah men, about 2600.

" What is a Rotumah man 2" said Fred, when the above figures were
obtained and read aloud by Frank. '

"Rotumah," said the Doctor, "is a small island lying in mid-ocean
about four hundred miles north of Feejee, and recently made a. British
possession. The natives are akind-
1y race; the women are prettier
than most other Polynesians, and
the men strong and of good size.
They make excellent sailors, and
~ you find them in ships all over the
South Pacific, and even in other
parts of the world. A gentleman
' who visited Rotumah told me it
was no uncommon thing to find
natives who had been in New
York, London, Liverpool, or Ham-
burg,.and_they could discuss the
relative merits of sailing and steam
vewels with an intelligence not al~
ways found among white sailors.

"Though living in an island
where nature is kindly and the
wants of man are few, the Rotumah
men are not unwilling to work;
they are consequently sought as
laborers in the Samoan, Tahitian, , _. ,
and other groups, and especially in A WWI", ",0,"

Feejee. So many men have been

taken from the island that the supply has been practically exhausted,
and the planters are compelled to look elsewhere. Some of the labor-
ers were kidnapped in the manner described in our discussion of the
labor-trade, but the most of those who emigrated were fairly and hon-
estly obtained."

The outlying islets of the Feejee group were first sighted by our
friends on the yacht, and in due time the peaks of the larger islands
came into view. The Feejeean Archipelago is situated between the fif--

teenth and twenty-second parallels of south latitude, and the meridians
of 177deg west and 175deg east longitude, and scattered over an area of
ocean some two hundred miles from north to south, and three hundred
from east to west. Its exact extent is not known, as there has been no
complete survey of the islands; one is now in progress under the direc-'
tion of the colonial government, but it will take some time for its com;
pletion. Surveying in Feejee is slow and difficult work, owing to the
dense tropical vegetation that is found everywhere.

The first island of importance which was sighted by our friends was
Kandavu, the fourth largest of the group and containing something like
10,000 inhabitants. As they expected to see it later, they did not stop
there, and the youths contented themselves by studying its well--wooded
slopes and fertile valleys, and the towering head of Mount Washington
3000 feet high on its western side. The captain told them that Kan- -
davu was the stopping-place of the mail-steamers on their way between
San Francisco and Australia, as it was more convenient and less dan-
gerous for theni than either Suva. or Levuka. He added that it abound-0N SHORE IN FEEJEE. 153

plies and water.

Steam was made as soon as Kandavu was sighted, and in a few
hours the Para was at anchor in the harbor of Suva, the capital of the
British colony of Feejee. Itvwas selected in 1880 by a. commission
appointed to secure a site for a future capital, the former one, Levuka,
having been found disadvantageous in some respects. Levuka. is more
centrally situated in the archipelago than Suva, but its harbor is not so
easy of amess, and a. ship approaching or leaving it has more dangerous
navigation. Levuka is on the small island of Ovolau, while Suva. is on
the south side of Viti Levu, which is, as before stated, the largest and
most populous of the group.

 

A rum-mes msmnxcn

On shore our friends found a. prosperous-looking place, when its
age was taken into oonsideration, and Frank said it reminded him of
a town in California or Colorado. There were half a dozen hotels,
several churches, which represented the Catholic, Episcopalian, Presby-
terian, and Methodist faiths, a great number of shops and stores, and
many well-built warehouses, cottages, and other dwellings. They went
to the principal hotel before proceeding to call upon their consuls or
make any acquaintances, and the pro-
prietor immediately offered to show
them the sights of Suva.

He pointed out the Governor's res-
idence, the jail, hospital, custom-house,
and lunatic asylum, together with oth-
er public edifices. Doctor Bronson sug-
gested that. there was every indication
of a fixed community when so young
a place could boast of a jail and a
lunatic asylum, not to speak of the cus
tom-house and the hospital.

" We needed a jail here before any-
thing else," was the reply to his re-
mark. "All the riffraff of the South
Seas seemed to be collected in Feejee
before the annexation, and there was
' ~ , ' nothing but the powerful arm of law,

A "3"" "mm- with jails and other paraphernalia, that
could preserve order."

"They had been gathering here for a long time, I presume," said
the Doctor, "and were most numerous just before the annexation."

"There had been a fair sprinkling of beach-combers and idlers,"

' was the reply, "ever since the islands were first occupied .by white men.
After them came men who wished to engage in planting cotton, sugar,
and other things for which the islands were supposed to be favorable;
there were some adventurers among them; but, on the whole, they were
a good class of citizens, as they were nearly all of birth and education,
and most of them brought some capital with which to go into busi-
ness.

"But in the latter part of the sixties we were inundated with a
different lot of adventurers. A few came with the design of planting
cotton, or engaging in some other honest employment, but the great
majority were penniless fellows, with no fondness for decent occupa-
tions. Many of them had left the Australian colonies to avoid arrest
for swindling or other crimes, and there was a fair share of men for
whom the prisons 'yawned for oifences of the most serious character.
Down to that time San Francisco had been the haven to which these
fellows emigrated, but it was easier to go to Feejee than to America,
and therefore Feejee got the benefi ,-"

>> "I think I heard something about it at the time," the Doctor re-
marked.

"Quite likely," responded his informant. "About 1870--71 Feejee
was a word of contempt in Australia. ' Gone to Feejee' had the same
meaning in Sydney and Melbourne that 'Gone to Texas' had in the
United States forty or fifty years ago; but now, under colonial rule, it
is an orderly land, and life and property are as safe as in Australia or
California." '

In the conversation that followed Frank and Fred learned that the
late King Thakombau, who died in 1883, offered the sovereignty of the
islands to the Queen of England under certain conditions, but the offer
was declined. ' Another ofifer was made in March, 1874, which was also
declined; but in October of the '
same year a deed of cession gave
the sovereignty of the islands to '
Great Britain. A charter was
shortly after issued, making Fee-
jee a' colony of Great Britain,
and the first governor, Sir Ar-
thur Gordon, arrived in June,
1875, and assumed authority.

The colony has been, on the
Whole, a prosperous one, though
there have been periods of de-
pression. Year by year the ca-
pabilities of the islands are be-
coming better' known, and it
would seem that there is'every
known kind of productive soil
in Feejee. Its swamps will pro- aomo 'm mm
duce rice in abundance, and the
other lands are adapted to sugar, cotton, cofiee, sweet-potatoes, yams,
and all other tropical productions, while in many localities pease, beans,
cabbages, apples, and other fruits and vegetables of the temperate zones

are successfully grown.
Frank asked about the eocoanut and bread-fruit trees, and was told '
that the former was indigenous, and the latter had been grown there so
long that it was practically so. The c'ocoanut-tree was an important
article of cultivation, and thousands of acres have been planted with it.

 

SOBNB ON A OWN PLANTATION.

For a long time the chief article of export was copra, but latterly it
has been exceeded by sugar. In 1875 the export of copra was 3871
tons; in 1884 it was 6682 tons, or nearly double the amount of nine
years before. As the young trees come into bearing the exportation of
copra will be greatly increased.

"The growth of the sugar-trade," said his informant, "has been
very rapid, as you will see by the figures. In 1875 the export of sugar
was 96 tons, and in 1876 it was 265 tons; in 1884 it was nearly 9000
tons; and in 1885, 10,586 tons. Molasses shows about the same increase
as its firstcousin, sugar, though the product of later years is not as val-
uable as some that preceded it, owing to the diminished price of the
article. .

"Cotton has not been a profitable crop on the whole," he contin-
ued, "and the production has fallen off frorn 386 tons in 1879 to 150 -THE PRODUCTIONS or FEEJEE. 157

tons in 1884, and only 45 tons in 1885. Many cotton-bushes have been
destroyed to make place for the cultivation of sugar; coffee has been
little, if any, more profitable than cotton, and many of the coffee plan-
tations are now devoted to bananas, which are an important article of
export. In 1875 less than $500 worth of fruit was sent from the islands,
while the exports for the last three years have exceeded $100,000 worth
annually.

"The other exports are beche--de--mer, tobacco, cocoafibre, tortoise-
shell, wool, hides, and pearl-shell, but none of them amount to a great
deal. The industries of the colony are somewhat hampered by restric-
tions upon the importation of foreign labor; in consequence of former
abuses the Government is very severe, and some of us think needlessly
so."

Frank asked in what particular he thought the authorities ought to
be more lenient. I

"The laborers are engaged for three years," was the reply, "and

    

under the old regulations a laborer
could be re-engaged for another
period of three years if he was
willing to do so. 'At present the
employers are compelled to return SUGAR-cm mm

him to his home, even though he is .

desirous of remaining here for another term. This is the rule as to
imported labor; if a planter hires Feejeeans to work for him he is
obliged'to make his engagements from month to month. The proba
bility is that coolie labor from India will in time drive out Polynesian
labor."

"Why so 1" Fred asked.

" Because of the lower relative price of it. Polynesians must be fed,
clothed, and cared for by the employer, and consequently it is not easy
to calculate exactly the cost of this kind of labor. The coolies feed
and care for themselves, and besides
they are better and more steady
laborers. A Polynesian laborer
costs about eighty dollars a year,
a Feejeeau one eighty-five dollars,
and a coolie from India or China
ninety-five to one hundred dollars.
But, all things considered, the Asi-
atic is preferable to the Polynesian."

There was further conversation
relative to the labor-trade, which
has already been discussed in this
book, and so we will not repeat it.
Our friends then took a stroll along
the Victoria Parade, a wide and
handsome avenue nearly a mile in
length. Frank and Fred were in-

Vfimmx mun-buss. terested in everything they saw,

and particularly with the passing

kaleidoscope of' Englishmen, Germans, Americans, and other white nag

tionalities, together with Chinese, Indian coolies, Feejeeans, Rotumah

men, and natives of half the islands of the Pacific. Of course the Fee--

jeeans were more numerous than any other race or kind of people that
passed before their eyes.

"The Feejeeans," said Frank, in his account of their visit to Suva,
"are considerably darker than the Samoans or Tahitians; Doctor Bron-
son says they belong to the race of Papuans rather than to the Ma- .
lays, though possessing characteristics of both. They are superior to
the Papuans in physique and in their degree of civilization, but they
have the frizzly hair and beard and the dark skin which indicates their
Papuan origin. Then, too, they use the bow and arrow for-Weapons,
and make pottery, neither of which is characteristic of the true Poly-
nesnm.

"What struck us as odd about them was their immense heads ofHER--DRESSING IN THE SOUTH SEAS. 159

hair, some of them being fully three feet in diameter. Hair-dressing
seems to be one of the fine arts in Feejee, and the barber is a most im-
portant personage, though less so today than formerly. And how do
you suppose they managed to get such enormous mops on their heads?

" Well, the naturally frizzly hair is ' improved ' by the barber. Each
particular hair is seized and pulled with tweezers until it stands out
straight, helped of course by the other hairs which have been served the
same way. The hair-dressing 'of a Feejeean dandy takes the greater
part of the time, and when he wishes to appear in specially fine style
he must be for akwhole day at least in the hands of his barber. When
the hair has been stretched out to the proper degree, it is Wrapped with
fine tappa or imported muslin, and in this condition presents a very cu-
rious appearance.

" The office of barber to the King was such a sacred one that the
royal barbers were tabu, or forbidden to do anything else. They could
not even feed, dress, or undress themselves, or do' anything whatever
with the hands which were to be used solely on the royal cciffure.
And yet there were plenty of men who coveted this honorable occupar
tion in spite of its manifest inconveniences.

"They are a polite people--at least we are told so, and certainly
have seen nothing to lead us to
think otherwise. The hotel-keeper
says the Feejeean boys make ex-
cellent table servants, and the na-
tive policemen along the streets
seem fully equal to any we have
ever seen outside of a European or
American city. Like all Polymer
sians, the Feejeeans are very cer-
emonious, and great sticklers for
etiquette. The chiefs and nobles
are surrounded with ceremony, and
one needs to be as careful in ap-
proaching them as in approaching
the Queen Of England 01' the Em" ax accmu'usnsn um.

peror of Russia.
"Here in Suva most of the people have adopted European dress, or

a modification of the native one, but back in the mountains they adhere
to their primitive garments. These are strips of cloth around the waist,
and owing to this enormous array of hair I have just told about they
sleep on a pillow consisting of a stick like a, thick lath, with legs four
or five inches long. It is like taking a section of a two-inch plank a
foot long and four inches wide, and resting one's neck on the edge.
A Feejeean pillow is by no means an inconvenient weapon in a fight,
and ' very handy to have in the house.'

"It is said the Feejeeans look upon lying as an accomplishment,
and I have been told that one of the worst stumbling-blocks in the way

to their conversion to Christianity was to have them understand that it
was wrong to tell deliberate. falsehoods. They have improved .a great
deal under missionary teachings, and there is still plenty of opportunity
for more improvement in the same direction. When angry, they are
sullen rather than noisy; when a chief is offended, he puts a stick in
the ground as a mark by which he remembers the cause of his anger.
After a. while he may pull up the stick as a Sign that his anger is re-
lenting, and he is ready to be propitiated with gifts.

"We look upon this people with a great deal of curiosity, as we
have all our lives associated them with terrible stories of the most hor-
rible forms of cannibalism. Happily this is a thing of the past, but it
is by no means so very long ago. Even now the people among the
mountains are said to indulge in it occasionally; but if they do, the
extent of the practice is very small by comparison with fifty years ago.

" How it was adopted no one knows; the Feejeeans have a tradition
that it began in an effort to prevent the incursions of people from other
islands, and as a result of battle, which is quite likely to have been the
case. In course of time it was not confined to enemies and foreigners,
but extended to those who were offered as sacrifices in the temples.-
Saerifices increased in number year by year until, as in Tahiti, a consid-
erable part of the population was liable at any time to be offered up at
the bidding of the priests or chiefs.

" In every village there were particular ovens 'and pots devoted toSTORIES 0F CANNIBALISM. 161

cooking the flesh of men, and the cooks were as skilled in the cannibal
art as are the Parisian chefs in theirs. It was not uncommon to see
twenty or thirty human bodies cooked at a. time for a great feast, and
the chiefs used to sacrifice their wives or their friends to gratify their
tastes for this horrible article of food. When a chief demanded bait-old
(long pig), the customary name for human flesh, his attendants used
to rush out and kill the first person they met in order to gratify his
wish!

"The bakola was not eaten with the fingers like other kinds of
food, but with wooden forks with long prongs, and these forks were
tabu for any other purpose. Each fork had a. special name, like an
individual; the fork of one of the cannibal kings was named mtdroun>>
do (' a dwarf carrying a burden '), and was presented in 1849 to one of
the missionaries by Ra Vatu, the son of the King referred to. Ra Vatu
talked freely about his father's love for human flesh, and showed to the
missionary the line of stones which registered the number of bodies he
had eaten. One of the native teach-
ers who accompanied the missionary
'counted the stones, and found they
numbered eight hundred and thirty-
two! Thakombau, the last King, was
a cannibal until the latter part of his
life, and his father, Tanoa, continued a
cannibal till the day of his death.

" Here is a story that I find in Dec--
tor Seemann's report of his visit to
Feejee: '

" ' A peculiar kind of taro was pointed out
as having been eaten with a whole tribe of peo-
ple. The story sounds strange, but as a num-
ber of natives were pmnt when it was told,
several of whom corroborated the various state-
ments or corrected the proper names that oc-
curred. its truth appears unimpenclmble. TASOA, WNW-R tune or name.

" 'In Viti Levu, about three miles north.
north-east. from Nmnosi, there dwelt a tribe known ns the Kni-na--locit, who, in days of
yore. gave great ofl'encc to the ruling chief of the Nnmosi district, and as a punishment for
their misdeeds the whole tribe was condemned to die. Every year the inmates of one
house were hnkcd and eaten, fire was set to the empty dwelling, and its foundation planted
With taro. In the following year, as soon as this taro was ripe, it became the signal for
the destruction of the next house and its inhabitants and the planting of a fresh field of
taro. Thus house after house and family after family disappeared, until the father of the

11
present chief pardoned the few that remained. In 1860 only one old woman was the sole
survivor of the Nn-locn people. Picture the feelings of these unfortunate wretches as
they watched the growth of the ominous taro ! There was no escape, as they would only
hasten their (loom by fleeing into territories where they were strungers.'

" When the Wesleyan missionaries came here in 1835 they found
cannibalism in full sway, and it now seems a wonder that they were
not immediately killed and
eaten. They partially owed
their exemption to the fact
that the flesh of white men
is considered insipid, or taint-
ed with tobacco, and therefore
they were not regarded as de-
sirable prey. Their progress
in converting the natives was
at first very slow, but they

A "MD" DANCE were patient and determined,

and in course of time they

were rewarded for their efl'orts. At present the great majority of the

people are professing Christians, cannibalism has ceased since 1878,

polygamy is rare, and idol worship is no more. After a time the Roman

Catholics established a. mission, and since the annexation the Church of
England has sent its representatives to Feejee.

"In 1885 the Wesleyans reported that they had 906 churches and
347 other preaching-places in the islands, 25,932 church--members, and
104,806 attendants upon public worship. They had 1749 day schools,
and 40,313 scholars in these schools, and they had nearly 42,000 chil-
(lren attending Sabbath-school. The Roman Catholics have about 8000
church-members, and the Church of England has a much smaller num-
ber, its adherents being principally Eng-
lishmen andother foreigners.

"So much for What the missionaries
have accomplished in this group of Pa
cific islands in the short space of fifty
years. At present the Wesleyans say
the expenses of maintaining their mis-
sions in' Feejee is about $25,000 a year;
and of this amount $15,000 is contrib-
uted here, the balance coming from
abroad. Reading, Writing, and arith- sxuu. Norm n nu; muqm anon".HOW FEEJEE Is GOVERNED. 163

metic are taught in the common schools; there are higher schools in
each missionary circuit, where persons are trained for the ministry,
and others can be educated. There is a central college at N avuloa,
where a superior education, both native and English, is given to those
who are preparing for ordination, and also to others who may desire
it. The Government has established industrial schools, where the sons
of chiefs are taught reading and writing as in the common schools,
and also instructed in house-carpentering, boat-building, and other-
trades. '

" I think I hear you asking how the English manage to govern the
islands when they are so few and the natives so numerous. Well,
Feejee is a crown colony, and its affairs are administered by a governor
and executive council; the laws are prepared by a legislative council of

thirteen members, seven of whom are ofiicial and six are nominated
by the Governor. In legal matters the imperial laws are followed,
except where there has been local legislation. All jury cases are de-
cided by the judge, with two assessors; the system of trial by jury was
abolished by the first governor, Sir Arthur Gordon, at the suggestion
of Sir John Gorrie, who was then chief-justice. The natives have a
system of local self-government which is recognized by the colonial
authorities; there are twelve salaried superior native chiefs exercising
executive functions under the Government, and also twenty-six native
magistrates."

Our friends found enough in and around Suva to interest them for
several days. They visited some of the cotton, sugar, and coffee planta-
tions in the vicinity, examined some of the sites of the ancient temples
of the Feejeeans which were the scenes, of horrible slaughters in the
days of cannibalism and idolatry, went through some of the native
villages, where they were kindly received by the chiefs, and did other
things which were very natural for visitors to do. There was nothing
especially new about the plantations, with the possible exception of the
groups of laborers from the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia, some of
whom were of races strange to the eyes of our friends. There were
men from Tanna, from the Solomon Islands, from New Guinea, and
also representatives of other groups of islands, until the whole made
quite a formidable list.

The owner of the largest plantation that they visited told Frank
and Fred that the men from the different islands would not fraternize
with one another any more than will Germans, Irish, and negroes in
America or England. They do not trust one another, and their huts are
in different groups, in widely separated parts of the plantation. Many
of them are cannibals, particularly the men from the Solomon and New
Hebrides islands, and occasionally get into open warfare for the pur-
pose of capturing somebody whom they can eat. This very distrust of
one another is to the advantage of the planter, who could not easily
manage them if they were united and harmonious.

, Fred thought the Solomon Islanders were the most repulsive look-
ing of the lot, and their employer said they were treacherous and re-
vengeful in addition to being murderous. In times past, before the
establishment of the Colonial Government, they used to make raids on
the villages and kill any unfortunate Feejeean they met, whom they
carried away and devoured. Of late years they have been restrained
from this practice, but not without some severe lessons.

" The Tanna men are not much unlike them," their informant con-
tinued, " but they are less treacherous and sullen, and are better work-
ers. They eat the flesh of men when they can get it, but they are also
fond of dogs, cats, lizards, rats, and flies."

As he Spoke he pointed to a pen containing several puppies which
the Tanna men were fattening, and would make the basisof a grand
feast on their next holiday.

From Suva the party went by a local steamer to Levuka, Colonell~'ROM-SUVA TO LEVUKA. 165

render navigation far from safe in these waters. They found the bar-
. bar of Levuka smaller than that of Suva, but in other respects equal
to it, as the anchorage was good, and the place well sheltered. from
gales. The barrier reef which forms the harbor is about a mile from
shore, and has two passages by which vessels may enter or leave port.

 

AVENUE 0? PALMS.

Of course the removal of the capital to Suva was a severe blow to
Levuka, but the place has a. good commerce of its own, and being more
centrally situated in regard to all the islands of the group, it is in no
danger of decay. It contains three or four hotels and several boarding-
houses, and its mercantile establishments are generally of a substantial
character. There are Wesleyan, Catholic, and Episcopalian churches in
Levuka, several branch buildings of the Government offices, and a well-
kept hospital for the use of such European strangers as may need med-
ical attention.

" The founders of Levuka. were not altogether happy in one respect,"
said one of the residents, who was pointing out its features to 0111'
friends. "The hills around it are so steep that. it was not practicable
to extend the town over them; we could build our dwellings there, but
it was out of the question to establish stores and shops where people

must climb to reach them, so we extended along the base of the hills,

and in some cases out into the sea, where we made land by filling in.

reason that it follows
the course of the
beach. Outside the
town it is prolonged
into a road that near-
ly surrounds the isl-
and of Ovolau, and
will completely encir-
cle it in time. Two
or three years ago
we started to build
a street railway; we
made surveys and sub-
scribed for the stock,
but the Government
opposed the project,
and it was given up."
Our friends found
accommodations at
one of the hotels, and H
were fairly comfort- mm m.
able, or would have V
been if they could have escaped the flies and mosquitoes. These insects
were numerous enough to form a veritable plague, and seemed to take
special delight in annoying strangers. A planter who was stopping at.
the hotel declared that the flies had sentinels stationed to give notice
of the arrival of'a stranger so that all could pounce on him at once, and
that whenever the flies grew weary of their work the mosquitoes came
forward to relieve them. Frank made a
sketch of a Feejee mosquito, while Fred
took the likeness of a native fly. These
works of art were laid carefully away where
the subjects thereof could not reach them
with intents of destruction or mutilation.
Dinner was taken at the hotel-table,
and proved, on the whole, a pleasant affair.
The youths made several acquaintances
among the planters, merchants, and others
who were stopping there; Frank and Fred

Nu;-
tion relative to the agricultural and other advantages of Feejee, and also
to the mode of life among the residents. The dinner consisted of pork,
salt and fresh beef, chicken, yams, taro, and other vegetables, together
with English and American preserves, and potted things that are found
wherever Englishmen are settled in the eastern or southern hemisphere.
" You may not think much of it when compared with a dinner in New
York or London," said one of the planters, "but if you go and live six
months or a year on a plantation you'll think a dinner here is the very
height of luxury. Salt beef and occasional chickens and pigs are our only
meats on the plantations, backed up by yams and taro in one unvarying
round. Where we can afford it we have potted and canned things, but
they are expensive, and very often cannot be had at any price. It has
repeatedly happened that men who had been living on the rough fare
of the plantations came to Levuka after an absence of months, and
overfed themselves at the hotel-table to such an extent as to bring on
a fatal illness"

After dinner they sat on the veranda of the hotel and enjoyed the
land-breeze which sets in a little after sunset, and is considerably cooler
than the day breeze from the sea. It is also free from flies and mosqui-
toes, which at this time retire to the sleeping-rooms of the hotel to
make ready fo1 the arrival of the lodgers. On the veranda the con-
versation was continued, and many features of Feejeean life were
touched upon

"It's a pity you are not to be here at balola time," said one of the
residents to Fred, when the latter had explained that their visit was to
be a very brief one.

Fred thought the gentleman said balcola, and immediately his
thoughts ran on the cannibalism of the Feejeeans in times past. He
remarked that he supposed those days were gone forever, but his in-
formant answered, to the great astonishment of the youth, that they
had the festival every year, and it was something not to be missed.

Then the gentleman went on to explain, and Fred soon ascertained
the difference between bakola and balola.

"The balola, or balolo," said he, " 1s a sea-worm whose scientific name
is palolo oz'rz'dz's. It looks like a string of vermicelli, being little larger
than a thread, and varying from an inch or two to a yard in length.
It lives somewhere in the sea, no one knows where; on two days of the
year it comes to the surface, and all the rest of the three hundred and
sixty-five it keeps carefully out of sight. The natives know exactly
when it will come; it first appears in October, the date being fixed byTHE BALOLA FESTIVAL. 169

the position of certain stars, and its second appearance is at the full
moon, between the twentieth and twenty-fifth of November.

"The worms are far more numerous in the November than in the
October appearance, and hence the October one is called the 'Little
Balola,' while the November coming is the 'Great Balola.' At the
great festival the sea is covered in some places to the depth of several
inches with these worms, which are red, green, and brown in dolor, and
form a. writhing and wriggling mass not altogether pleasant to look at.
They come a little past midnight, and when the sun rises they sink
down out of sight and remain there until the next year."

" How curious!" exclaimed the youth, in astonishment.

 

ONE VARIETY OF SBA-WORN.

"No one has been able to explain the phenomenon," was the reply,
"nor tell how and where the worm passes the rest of his time. Why
he appears on these occasions and no other, or why he appears at ell,
nobody has yet found out, and you may be sure the worms won't glve

up the secret. _
"The natives go out in their boats in great numbers; every native

boat that can float is occupied, and the Europeans go along at the same
time to see the fun. As long as the worms remain every native is busy
with baskets and ladles trying to fill his boat with them; there is a
great deal of excitement and laughter, as the people steal from one an-
other and have as much fun as they can out of the festival. Then there
are shoals and shoals of fish of all
sizes and kinds that are feeding on
the worms, and seem to understand
that they must make the most of
their opportunity.

" As soon as daylight comes, and
the worms sink out of sight, the
people return to the shore, wrap the
worms in taro-leaves, and cook them
in ovens after their manner of roast-
ing. The supply is so great that
there is enough for everybody for
several days, and baskets of balola
are sent to friends in the interior,
just as you send fruit and game in
America. The stufl' is not agreeable
to European taste, but isn't so bad
after all when you can conquer your
prejudice against eating worms."

. come we BALOLA. " To show the force of the relig- '

ious convictions of the Feejeeans,"

said another resident, "let me say that when the festival comes on Sun-

day not a, single canoe of the natives goes out except those of the

Roman Catholic Church members. The Methodists obey the religious

requirements so closely that not a canoe will go on the water on Sun-

day except to carry a preacher to church. You cannot hire one of

these people to climb a cocoanuttree on Sunday, or do any other work
that is not strictly one of necessity." .

"What an immense change," said another, "from the days when
cannibalism prevailed throughout the islands, and when all public cere-
monials were attended with human sacrifices. 0n the death of a chief
his wives and servants were buried alive with him, in order that he
could have their company in the spirit world. When a chief's house
was built a slave stood in each post-hole to support the post, and was
buried there alive. War-canoes were launched or drawn ashore over
the bodies of living prisoners, who served as rollers and were crushedBURYING PEOPLE ALIVE. 171

to death by the weight. Life was held of no consequence, and par-
ents who were ill or felt the weakness of age coming used to ask their
children to bury them. A missionary was once invited by a young
man to attend the funeral of the latter's mother; she walked cheerquy
to the grave, and sat down in it to have the earth heaped about her by
her children, and was much surprised when the missionary interfered
to prevent the proceeding.

 

ANCHXT I'BSJBEAN WAR-DANCE.

" And I have heard," he continued, "of a young man who was ill
and feared he would get thin and be laughed at by the girls of his
acquaintance. He asked his father to bury him, and the latter cou-
seuted. When the youth had taken his place in the grave he asked to
be strangled. The father scolded him, and told him to sit still and be
buried just like other folks, and make no further trouble. Thereupon
the youth became quiet, and the burial was completed."

" Can this really be true 2" queried the youth.
"The story is found on page 475 of Erskine's 'Journal of a Cruise
among the Islands of the Western Pacific,' " said his infommnt, "and
I have no doubt whatever of its truth. The evidence as to the former
customs of the Feejoeaus is so direct and positive that it cannot be
doubted." ,

Fred lay awake for some time that night, his thoughts busy with
the changes which had been wrought in the islands of the great ocean
through the labors of the missionaries. Afterwards he watched the
effect of the moonlight on the waters, and while watching fell asleep.

VI'HE second day of the stay of our friends at Levuka was Sunday,

and the party attended the Episcopal church in the forenoon,
where service was conducted by a clergyman who had recently arrived
from London. In the afternoon they strolled to the native village out-
side the town, where they found some fifty or sixty Feejeeans squatted
on the matcovered floor of the neat and well-swept church listening to
a, preacher of their own race. They were amused to see a tall man
armed with a; long stick with which he occasionally touched the heads
of those who were inattentive, and sometimes his touch was far from
light. Frank thought the idea would not be a bad one for churches
nearer home, where worshippers have been knowu to go to sleep dur-
ing the sermon.

The preacher was a tall, fine-looking man of at least fifty years, and
he spoke with an eloquence that indicated his earnestness and fervor.
Of course his language was unknown to our friends, but they all agreed
that the Feejeean tongue is capable of much expression. It contains
many guttural sounds that do not always strike the American or Eng-
lish ear agreeably, and the orator seemed to speak with more rapidity
than is compatible with a clear understanding on the part of his hear-
ers. When the semen was ended the preacher offered a prayer, and
then a hymn was sung by the whole congregation. The air was a
familiar Methodist one, but the words were Feejeean. Whether the
meaning of the original hymn was preserved with the air no one of the
listeners was able to say, and there was no interpreter present to tell
them.

As soon as service was over the strangers were surrounded by a
group of natives, and there was an attempt at conversation; but as our

 

KISSION CHURCH IN THE "13133 ISLANDS.

friends were totally unlearned in Feejeean, and the vocabulary of the
natives was principally confined to the word " shillin'," there was not
much interchange of thought. Nearly every Feejeean understands
"shillin'" well enough to pronounce it. He has a clear idea that it
means money, and it is in this sense that it is used. Ask a native what
he will sell his house for, and he will answer "shillin' ;" ask him the
price of a cocoanut, and the reply is the same. In the former case he
would of course decline the offer if actually made, and in the latter he
would bring you twenty or fifty cocoanuts for the figure named.

In strolling around as the congregation dispersed Frank and Fred
became separated from the rest of the party, but without any misgiv-
ings as to their safety or loss of way, as they were accompanied by
several natives, one of whom invited the youths to his house. This wasVISITING A FEEJEEAN FAMILY. 175

an invitation not to be ignored; it was accepted at once, and the man
led the way along a path to where he lived. It was a hut of dried
reeds lashed to a. framework of poles, and stood with a dozen similar
huts in the shade of a grove of cocoa-trees. The thatched roof was
high and. arched, while the sides were very low, and had no windows.
There were two doors on opposite sides, but the door-way was so low
that it was necessaryvto stoop almost double in order to enter. In
front of the but was a lot of bones and all manner of refuse, and a
couple of pigs were lying across the doorway They showed no in.
clination to move as the master of the house approached; but on catch-
ing sight, and possibly smell, of the strangers, they were up and off
very quickly.

 

GOING 1'0 ClluRCll.--'RIVER SWNE.

Inside the but the floor was covered with plaited rushes, and there
was a low partition of reeds dividing it into two nearly equal spaces;
one of these was used as kitchen and sitting- room and the other for
sleeping; but there was no furniture in either place beyond three or
four of the wooden pillows already described. In one corner of the
kitchen was a rough hearth,
with some clay pots in which
fish and yams were cooked.
Partly by signs and partly
by the words "want eat," the
host invited the youths to
stay to dinner. They ac-
cepted, more to see how and
upon what the natives live
rather than on account of
having an appetite. Fire was
lighted on the hearth, or rath-
er it was stirred up from
some slumbering coals, fish
. and yams were put' on to
mm")! 11m). boil, and in a little while the
meal was ready. Frank and
Fred made friends with the children, to whom they showed their
watches, and made a few presents of silver coin asean indirect com-
pensation for their dinner, and when the meal was ready they proceeded
to enjoy it. One of the children had been sent for some bananaleaves,
which served as plates; on these leaves the fish and yams were dished
up, and a piece of rock-salt was brought out, together with a shell, with
which each guest could scrape off as much salt as he liked, and when-
ever he wanted it. The youths made apractical demonstration of the
truth of the adage that fingers were made before forks, though not
without some inconvenience.
To end the repast they had
some ripe bananas, and of
course the drink that accom-
panied the meal was the juice
of freshly picked cocoanuts. ,
As soon as Frank and
Fred rose from the mats the
youngsters of the family at-
tacked what they had left,
and in a very few minutes
nothing remained save the
lump of salt and the empty
banana- leaf plates. Then mum's wnroxs.
there was handshaking all around, and the visitors took their leave.
The host accompanied them to the road leading back to town, and
there left them, but not until he had pocketed a shilling which Frank
tendered him. _

Clouds were forming in the sky, and the youths thought it would
be prudent to return to the hotel. They did so, and found the rest of
the party on the veranda waiting for the promised shower. In a few
minutes the rain came down thick and fast, and the wisdom of return-
ing was no longer in doubt. The shower was soon over, however, and
then the sun came out as brightly as ever, though there was no appar-
ent change in the temperature.

"You are in the best season of the year," said one of their new
acquaintances; "it's fortunate for you that it's not hurricane time now."

"We have here," he continued, " a dry season and a wet one. The
former is cool, and lasts from May to October; the latter is hot, and lasts
from October to May. During all
the dry season, and for'a month at
each end of the wet one, the climate
is delightful, the temperature vary-
ing from 70deg to 76deg or 78", and the
heat of the sun being tempered by
breezes from the sea. The mean
temperature is about 80deg, the ex--
treme ranges thus far recorded be-
ing 60deg and 122deg. From Christmas
to March is called the 'hurricane,
season ;' the air is moist and sticky,
the temperature averaging 84deg,with
a humidity so great that one seems
to be constantly in a Russian steam-
bath. This is the unhealthy season,
and fevers and other diseases due
to the heat and moisture are com-
mon."

Frank asked if hurricanes were
frequent during the season. "5"" "1" 5m"-

"Not at all," was the reply,

" but when they do come they are in dead earnest. From 1879 to 1886

We didn't have a really severe hurricane; but this is, I believe, the long-

est interval known to any of the European residents. One old settler
12
told me there were several years when not a season passed without at
least one hurricane."

"Are they very destructive?" Fred inquired.

"I can best answer that question," said the gentleman, "by describ-
ing the first hurricane I ever passed through in the Feejees.

 

YORMATION 01' CLOUDS BEFORE A FEE-133m HURRICAXS.

" I was on a. plantation in which I had bought an interest, and during
the whole of the month of March the weather was very calm and sul-
try. One day, towards the beginning of April, the wind turned to the
north-west, which was quite unusual; squalls and showers followed, and
then the breeze freshened into a gale. Heavy clouds covered the sky,
thunder sounded loud and long, the barometer fell, and the clouds seem-
ed to sweep just above the tops of the trees. Then the rain came in
torrents, flooding all the level ground, and turning the brooks into
rivers. Our party took shelter in the largest and strongest house in
the neighborhood--one that had stood through several hurricanes, and
was thought to be proof against them.' CAUGHT IN A HURRICANE. 179

" For two days the wind blew, and every hour it increased. By the
second night it was a. fully developed hurricane whose velocity we had
no means of measuring. The rain fell tremendously; the lightning was
vivid, and almost continuous. The
thunder followed the course of the
storm; and altogether the noise was
so great that we had to shout to one
another to be understood. Our house
shook like a. rickety bird-cage, and
many times it seemed to be half
lifted from the ground; but it stood
through the storm, and was the only
one that did so.

" On the following morning the
wind had died down to a moderate
gale, and we could venture out. The
picture that presented itself cannot
possibly be described with anything
like vividness. Cocoanut and bread-
fruit trees by the thousand had been
thrown down or stripped of their
leaves; bananaplants were in the

same condition; the grass was lev-
elled, and covered with mud and water, and not a. house in the neigh-

borhood remained standing. In the cotton-fields not only were the
leaves and bolls stripped from the plants, but in many places the plants
had been torn up by the roots and lay in heaps. In Levuka many
houses were blown down; vessels were driven ashore, or broken to

pieces at their moorings; and the whole windward coast of the islands
was strewn with wrecks. Many foreign Vessels that were known to
be in Feejee waters, or near the islands, were never heard of again, and
they doubtless went down on that terrible night. At Macuata, on
Vanna Levn, the wind lifted a, small vessel bodily from the beach and
blew it into a native village two or three hundred yards away l"

 

LOH IN Tl]! HURRICANI.

The story of the hurricane led to various anecdotes of the South
Seas, and in this way the afternoon was passed until dinner-time. One
man told how a ship on which he once sailed was driven before a hurri-
cane and thrown upon a reef, where the waves dashed her to pieces.
He was "carried into the comparatively smooth lagoon inside the reef,
and saved himself by swimming, all his companions being drowned.
Fortunately for him, the islanders among whom he landed were not
cannibals, or he would have been condemned at once to the oven. TheA WALKING PICTURETGALLERY. 131

cannibals of the South Pacific have always regarded people shipwrecked
on their shores as special gifts or windfalls, just as the inhabitants of
certain parts of the coast of the United States are said to have regarded
the cargoes of wrecked ships less than a century ago. Of course he

taught the natives many useful things, and eventually married the
daughter of the chief, and became a chief himself when his father in-

law died.
Another man, who claimed to have visited half the islands of the

Pacific, endeavored to prove his assertion by asking our friends to step
inside for a few moments, where he removed his clothing and exhibited
samples of the tattooing of pretty nearly every group. "That clouded
pattern on my left leg," said he, "was done in the Kingsmill group,
while those squares and fancy stripes on the right leg were put on in

while the left side was the work of the best artist of the Marquesas Isl-
ands. The fancy embroidery on my breast is of New Zealand, and that
down my back was done in Tahiti."
Truly this man was a. walking art-gallery of the Pacific Islanders,
only his hands and face remaining unmarked by the tattoo. When the
inspection was completed, and our friends had left the man to resume
his dress, Frank suggested that he would be a fine prize for a medical
museum, where his skin could be preserved after his death. Doctor
Bronson agreed with him, but the suggestion was not offered to the
subject of the conversation. ,

 

A YOUNG SIUD'KNT.

The party returned to Suva by the steamer that brought them to
Levuka, and there a change of plans occurred. Doctor Bronson, with
Frank and Fred, proceeded to New Zealand by the regular mail'steam-
er, while Colonel Bush, with the Para, continued his cruise among the
islands of the Pacific. Our friends were sorry to part with their pleas-
ant companions and the splendid hospitality of the yacht, but they did
not feel justified in protracting their stay among the islands, since thereTHE FRIENDLY, on TONGA, ISLANDS. 183

is a general similarity of the groups to each other, though they may
difier greatly in detail.

Frank and Fred regretted that they could not visit the Friendly, or
Tonga, Islands, the first destination of the Pew, but they consoled them-
selves by reading what they could find on the subject. They learned
that the Tonga group was discovered by Tasman and visited by Cook,
who gave the isles the name of Friendly, on account of the apparently
amiable disposition of the inhabitants. They have a population of about
twenty-five thousand, and are farther advanced in civilization than their
neighbors of Fecjee or Samoa. The Wesleyan missionaries have con-
verted them to Christianity; many of them can speak English, and have
learned reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, and on the whole
stand high in the scale of education. The products of the Tonga Islands
are similar to those otthe Feejees, and the group is also subject to hur-
ricanes, which are 'often very destructive.

The principal island isTongataboo, which is low and level, of coral
formation, and about twenty miles long by twelve broad. Here the
King resides, and here, too, is the principal mission station, the King
being an earnest Christian, and a regularly ordained preacher in the
pulpit. He wears European clothes, has European furniture in his
house, employs an Englishman as his private secretary, and altogether
is quite a civilized gentleman. He has caused good roads to be made
around and across the island, and in other ways has made his little king-
dom know the advantages of the lands beyond the seas.

 

STONE IONGMBXT. TONGA'L'BOO.
Fred was particularly interested in reading about a curious monu-
ment of former days that is to be seen in Tonga, and of which the
natives have no tradition. It reminded him of the monuments of Eas-
ter Island, and he made the following note on the subject:

"It stands on a. grassy lawn in the interior of the island, and is so
surrounded by tropical growths that it is concealed from view until the
visitor is close upon it.
It consists of three huge
stones, two of them up-
right like pillais, and
the third resting upon
them. This upper stone
is eighteen feet long,
twelve feet wide, and
fifteen feet above the
ground; resting upon it
is, or was, an immense
bowl ' of hewn stone,

A VDLCANO in mm meiric. which 'is supposed to

have been connected

with some of the religious ceremonies of the people who erected this

monument. But how they put the three stones in their places is an
unfathomable mystery."

Fred also wanted to see a famous cavern in one of the Tonga. Islands
which can only be reached by diving into the sea, as the mouth is com-
pletely under water at all times. A young Tongan found it while div-
ing after a turtle, and he afterwards utilized it as the place of conceal-
ment of the girl with whom he had fallen in love, and who was the
daughter of a chief whose displeasure he had incurred. He persuaded
her to flee with him and follow him into the water; these women swim
like dolphins, and she dived after him and rose into the cave, which is
beautifully lighted by the phosphorescent rays from'the water, very
much as is the famous Blue Grotto near Naples.

Here she remained for months, everybody wondering what had be-
come of her, and also wondering why the young man absented himself
so frequently, and always returned with wet hair. He carried her fruit
and fish to eat and a supply of mats for carpeting the stone floor at one
side of the cavern. One day his companions followed him, and dived
where they had seen him disappear. Thus they found the cave; but what
became of its inmates is not clearly recorded in the history of Tonga.ARRIVAL IN NEW ZEALAND. 185

It takes an excellent swimmer to make the visit to the cave without
danger of death from drowning. The entrance bristles with sharp
points of rock, and when a. native dives he turns on his back and uses
his hands to keep himself clear of these dangerous obstructions. The
captain of an English manof--war tried to enter the cavern, but was so
severely injured against the sharp rocks that he died in consequence.
We will leave the Peru to pursue her course among the islands of
the Pacific, while we accompany Doctor Bronson and the youths on
their voyage to New Zealand and Australia. The mailsteamer Zea-
lamlz'a carried them swiftly along, and on the'morning of the fifth day
they were in sight of the shores which were their destination. From
Suva to Auckland, the former capital of New Zealand, is a distance of
about one thousand miles, and there is regular communication both
waysmonthly'between the two points. There is also steam communi--
cation between Sydney and Feejee, about sixteen hundred miles--some-
times direct from one port to the other, and sometimes by way of
New Caledonia, which lies a short
distance out of the direct track.
The Zealrmdz'a entered Hauraki
Gulf, passing between the Great
. Barrier and Little Barrier islands,
and holding her course almost due
south; then, through the Rangi-
toto Channel, she turned, and the
- harbor of Auckland was before her.
" Shall we have to wait for the
tide 2" Frank asked, as they passed
Great Barrier Island. "It often
happens that we have to wait sev-
eral hours for a tide when we're all
impatience to get on shore."
"We don't have to wait for _
tides at Aucklanc ," replied an of- H mm", an".
ficer of the W, to whom the
query was addressed. " We can come in at dead low-water and steam
to an anchOrage, or to the dock if we're ready to go there. The least
depth is thirty-six feet at dead low-water of the spring-tide, and at the
highest tides we have fifty feet.
"There is hardly a finer seaport anywhere," he added, "than Wai-
tamata, as the harbor of Auckland is frequently called by the New
Zealanders. It has, as I've told you, plenty of water at all times, and
its entrances are superb. Rangitoto Channel is the one generally used;
the other is I-Iieh Channel, and would be considered first-rate in many a
place I know of. Rangitoto is about two miles wide; the section of
the harbor between North Head and Kauri Point is about a mile across,
and therefore is easily fortified in case we have to defend it against a
hostile fleet."

 

ISLAKDS ON THE COAST.

" I see," said Fred, who had been studying the map, "that the island
is very narrow here." _

" Yes," was the reply; "it is only six miles across; and if you exam-
inc carefully you'll see a good harbor on the other side. That is the
harbor of Manakau, and there's a railway connecting it with Waita-
mata."

"It reminds me of Corinth, in Greece," said Fred, as he continued
the contemplation of the map.

"No doubt it does," said the officer, in response. "Auckland is called
the Corinth of the South Pacific; Corinth is now having a canal made
through its isthmus, and we hope to have one for ours in due time."

The steamer made her way direct to the wharf, and as soon as she
had made fast and the gang-plank was out, our friends stepped on shore
in New Zealand. Under the guidance of a fellow-passenger, they en-
tered a carriage and were driven up Queen Street, the principal thor-THE FOUNDING or AUCKLAND. 187

oughfare, to the hotel they had selected for a. restingplace during their
sojourn in Auckland. They were favorably impressed with the activity
3 that prevailed on the streets, and the general evidences of business pros-
perity. "A Missourian would call it ' a right smart place,' " said Frank,
as they were alighting from the carriage at the end of their drive.

" Yes," responded Fred, "and even a New Yorker would treat its
beautiful bay with respect after seeing it as we did."

" Where did the city get its name t" one of the youths asked Doctor
Bronson.

"It was named after Lord Auckland, First Lord of the Admiralty,
and afterwards Governor-general of India, by Captain IIobson, who

 

AUCKLAND xx 1840.

founded the city. Captain Hobson was sent here, in 1838, to organize a
colony. He saw this was a. good site for a city, and accordingly he
established the capital here. It remained the capital until 1865, when
a royal commission moved the seat of government to Wellington, the
latter place being more centrally located. Of course the Aucklanders
were-not at all pleased at the change, but their city is so well estab-
lished commercially that there is no danger of their being ruined by it."

From various sources Frank and Fred found that Auckland had a
population of nearly forty thousand within the municipality, and seven~
ty thousand in the city and sublu'bs. " It has," said Frank, in his jour~
nal, " handsome streets, at great number of well-constructed public build~
ings, such as post-office, custom-house, exchange, courts, Government
offices, and the other paraphernalia. of a wellLestablished city, and it has
also a fine museum, a public library, and a park and botanical garden.
No city would be complete without a. cemetery, and Auckland is not
behind in this respect, as it has a very pretty one, and, as the French
say, it is well peopled

"We were much interested in the Queen Street wharf, where we
landed; it extends nearly two thousand feet into the harbor, and af-
fords facilities for thirty or forty vessels to discharge or receive cargoes
at once. There are several other wharves, including a fine one, nearly
completed, at the end of Hobson Street. I have heard often of 'Hob--
son's Choice,' and never knew exactly what it was. This city seems to
have been Hobson's choice, since Captain Hobson founded it; all I can
say is, that I shall have more respect for the old saw than I ever had
before.

" You can get an idea of the commerce of the place when you know
that about two hundred and fifty sailing-vessels are owned here of an
aggregate burden of twenty thousand tons, and sixty-five steamers of
seven thousand tons altogether. It has regular steam communication
with Australian ports by the vessels of the Union Steamship Company,
has a monthly line to Feejee, and is a port of call for the mail-- steamers
between Australia and California. The Northern Steamship Company
of Auckland has a fleet of thirteen steamers, principally engaged in
coast navigation, so that New Zealand' is well served by its own boats.

"Of course the port has graving or dry docks for the accommoda-
tion of the ships that need them. There was one three hundred feet
long, and forty-two feet wide, but it was found inadequate after a few
years, and now they are completing another five hundred feet long and
ninety feet wide. This ought to belong and wide enough; but if ships
go on increasing in size as they have been, it won't be a great while be-
fore another and longer dock will be needed-at Auckland as well as in
other ports."

While Frank was noting the foregoing points in regard to Auckland,
Fred was writing a few paragraphs relative to New Zealand. And first
he wondered how it came to be New Zealand instead of New England
or New Britain.

" That's easily explained," said Doctor Bronson, "by the fact that it.A SHORT HISTORY OF NEW ZEALAND. ' 189

was discovered by the Dutch navigator, Tasman; the French and Span-
iards both lay claim to a previous discovery, but the evidence they offer
' is very doubtful. Tasman was sent in 1642 by Van Dieman, Governor-
general of the Dutch East Indies, to explore the coast of New Holland.
He made the exploration and called the country Van Dieman's Land,
in honor of the Governor- general, but the name has recently been
changed to Tasmania. On this voyage he discovered this country,
which he called New Zealand, in honor of the province of his birth; he
also discovered the archipelagos of the Feejee and Friendly isles, and
retin'ned to Batavia, having been absent only ten months.

 

VIEW 0" AUCKLAND PROM MOUNT 8012".

"Look at the map," continued the Doctor, "and you will see that
New Zealand is divided nearly in the centre by a, channel of the sea.
known as Cook Strait. The two islands thus formed are known as
North Island and South Island, the former containing forty-eight thou-
sand square miles, and the latter fifty-seven thousand. Beyond South
Island is Stewart Island, which is triangular, and measures about thirty-
six miles on a side; taken together the three islands remind you of
Italy, and are shaped not unlike a boot with its toe towards the north.
South Island is sometimes called Middle Island, from its position be-
tween North and Stewart islands. _

"Cook Strait commemorates the great navigator who was killed
on the Sandwich Islands. He landed here in 1769, and took possession

 

MISSION STATION AT TANGXTERORIA, NEW ZEALAND.

of the country in the name of England. He made five visits altogether
to New Zealand, and introduced pigs, potatoes, sheep, goats, and other
animals and vegetables."

" I-Iadu't Tasman already taken the country for Holland?" said
Frank.

" No," replied the Doctor, " he did not set foot at all in New Zea
land. He anchored in a. bay in South Island, next to' that in which the
town of Nelson now stands, and had an encounter with the natives who
opposed his going on shore. He lost four men in the fight, named the
place Massacre Bay, in memory of the occin'rence, and sailed away
without landing."

" How soon after Captain Cook's occupation of the country did the
British Government establish colonies?"

"Not for some time," replied Doctor Bronson. "In the latter part
of the last century and the beginning of this many American and Eng-
lish Whalers visited New Zealand, and year by year the knowledge of _
the country was increased. Visitors usually got along well enough
with the natives, and were kindly treated; whenever there were en-
counters with the New Zealanders they were generally caused by the
misconduct of the visitors themselves. Thus, in 1809, the captain of
the English ship Boyd flogged and otherwise ill-treated a native chief,
and the followers of the latter took a terrible revenge by-killing no less
than seventy of the crew and passengers.

" On some parts of the coast the natives were for along time hostile,
probably in consequence of outrages that had been committed by whale-
men and others. Some of their ideas of the white men were curious.

 

MRI-Y DAYS IN NEW ZKALAND.

The natives paddle their boats with their faces towards the bow, and
when they saw the foreign boats coming to the shore they thought the
men had eyes in the backs of their heads because they rowed with
their backs in the direction of their course. Some of them thought the
ships were great birds, and their boats the bircllets or chicks.

"As in Polynesia, the missionaries were the pioneers of civilization
in New'Zealand. They came here in 1814, and previous to that time
only one European, 8. shipwrecked sailor, is known to have lived among
the natives. The Church Missionary Society established a mission in
that year at the Bay of Islands, now called Russell--the mission party
consisting of Rev. Samuel Marsden, chaplain to the Government of New
South Wales, and three other ministers, Kendall, Hall, and King. They
were kindly received by the chiefs, and held their first service on Christ-
mas-day, 1814. Eight years later the Wesleyans established missions in
New Zealand, and sixteen years after that (in 1838), the Roman Cathi
olics did likewise."

"Then the missionaries were in advance of all Government coloni-
zation 2" said Fred.

" The Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyans certainly were,"
was the reply, "as the Government did not send a resident oflicial
here till 1833. He had no power beyond that of writing reports of
what he saw and heard, and was felicitously styled by somebody 'a
man-of-war without guns.' There had been an attempt to form a col-
ony in 1825, but it was given up, and the sixty emigrants who came
out from England returned in the ship that brought them. The mission
establishment at Kororareka, in the Bay of Islands, became the nucleus
around which a good many lawless adventurers gathered. The bay was
the resort of whaleships, and in 1838 it was visited by fifty-six Ameri-
can, twenty-three English, twenty-one French, one German, and twenty-
four New South Wales ships. There was so much lawlessness and
crime that a vigilance committee was formed, very much like the insti-
tutions of that name which have been famous in California history.

"In 1837," continued the Doctor, glancing occasionally at a book he
held in his hand,* "an association was formed for the purpose of colo-
nizing the country, very much as India had been colonized by the East
India Company. It was styled the New Zealand Company, and was
founded by Lord Durham, and after some delay a surveying ship was
sent out, followed by several ships carrying emigrants. This was the
beginning of the colonization of New Zealand; the first settlement
was made at what is now Wellington, the capital, though it was then
named Port Nicholson. Auckland was founded soon after; and with -
the foundation of that city and the establishment of a government, the
colony was well under way. It prospered for a while, and then, owing
to quarrels with the natives, there was a long period of gloom.

"We will talk more on this subject by~end-by," said the Doctor;
"just at present we will use our eyes in studying the present rather
than the past."

With this hint the youths closed their note-books and returned them
carefully to the pockets where they belonged.

The youths were curious to see a Maori (pronounced mow-r , the
first syllable rhyming with "cow "), and they had not left the steps of
the hotel before their desire was gratified. Their fellow-passenger from
the ZeaZa/ndz'a, pointed out several of the aborigines of New Zealaud,
and among them he recog-
nized an acquaintance, who
greeted him cordially. ,

Frank was disappointed
at seeing the man dressed
in European garb, and
looking altogether so much
like an Englishman that
he was not readily distin-
guished from the men of
British origin. He was
fully six feet high, muscu-
lar and well-formed, and
had a slight tendency to
corpulence. His face was
darker than that of the
average Englishman, and
about the complexion of
a native of the middle or
south of France, and cer- m A sum or DECADBXC'B.
tainly lighter than the
southern Italian. Frank thought it could be described as a light
brown; but he was informed that these people are of different hues,
and the Mantis have twelve names to indicate as many shades of color.

The eyes of this specimen native were black, and his hair was also
black and slightly curly. As he talked he displayed a fine set of teeth;
and as dentists are unknown among the Maoris, it is to be supposed
these teeth were natural. His features were regular and symmetrical,
the nose having a slight tendency to an aquiline form, the lips large and
well developed, but not thick like those of the negro, and the' mouth
capacious enough for all practical purposes.

13
After a short conversation with his friend the Maori passed on, and
then Frank learned that he belonged to one of the families of chiefs,
and could therefore be considered as belonging to the aristocratic branch
of the race.

"There are about forty thousand, or perhaps forty-five thousand,
Maoris in New Zealand at present," said the gentleman. "Two or three
thousand of them live on South Island, and all the rest upon North
Island. The families of the chiefs are readily distinguished by their
superior grace and dignity, just as the aristocratic part of a race is dis-
tinguished in any other part of the world. When Captain Cook came
here the Maoris were savages and cannibals, though they had a patri-
archal form of government, and in several ways had made an approach
to civilization."

"They practised tattooing, did they not ?" one of the youths asked.

" Certainly," was the reply; "and some of them still do so, though
the habit is dying out. In another generation it will hardly be heard
of any more. The Maoris are becoming assimilated to the European
population around them. Many of. them own houses and farms, have
large herds and flocks, and there are several Maori merchants and ship-
owncrs. Many of them are employed by the English settlers and mer-
chants, and you will find them on the railways and in the coasting
steamers, where they make good sailors and are generally liked by their
employers."

Frank asked whence they were supposed to have come, and how long
it probably was since theyr settled in New Zealand.

"They are of Malay origin," said the gentleman, " and according to
their traditions, which are unusually clear, they came here from either
the Sandwich or the Samoan islands, four or five centuries ago, in a. fleet
of thirteen large canoes, which were followed by others. The names of
their canoes, the chiefs that commanded them, and the places where
they landed are carefully preserved in their traditions. They say that
they came from an island called Hawaiki, in the Pacific Ocean, and this
is thought to be either Savaii, in the Samoan group, or Hawaii in the
Sandwich Islands. Their language is so nearly like that of the Sand-'
wich Islanders that the two people can understand each other after a
little practice.

"They had no written language until one was made for them by
the missionaries, and the nearest approach to it was a knotted stick,
by which the wise men transmitted the names of successive chiefs.
They had a great many songs of love, war, religion, and other things,195

but these are fast dying out, and so are their traditions and legends.
Sir George Grey collected many of their poems, myths, and fables,
and published them in a large octavo volume, and if you wish to know
more on this subject you can see the book in our public library."

 

CARVED NK'V ZIMLAND cum.

Fred asked if they were diminishing in numbers as rapidly as the
' people of the South Sea Islands had diminished since the advent of the
white strangers.

" Yes," was the reply," but civilization has had less to do with their

reduction than the quarrels among themselves. When Captain Cook
took possession of the islands, it is thought there were 120,000 Maoris
living here; today there are less than 50,000. Before the whites came
here the Maoris were divided into eighteen nations or great tribes, and
the nations were subdivided into tribes, of which each had its chief
whom it acknowledged. Each tribal chief regarded the head of his
nation as his lord and obeyed his orders.

" The nations were constantly at war with eachother, and then, too,'
the tribes of any one nation might be at war among themselves. The
Maoris loved war for its own sake, vastly preferring it to peace, how-
ever much it might inconvenience them. Some of their ways were re
culiar, and quite at variance with European notions or customs. Shall I
tell you some of them i"

The youths expressed their desire to hear more about this interesting
people, and their informant continued: '

" Their wars were conducted with great ferocity, and the vanquished
were either enslaved by the victors or killed and eaten."

"That is not so very strange," said Fred, as the gentleman paused;
" savages in many parts of the world do the same thing."

" Of course they do," was the reply; " but they do not divide theirPECULIAR CUSTOMS on THE moms; 197

ammunition and supplies with their enemies in order that they can
fight on equal terms."

" Did the Maoris do that t" Fred asked in astonishment.

"Certainly they did, on several occasions that are known to the
white residents. While they were at war with the English they used
to send notice whenever they were about to make an attack, and they
thought we did not treat them fairly in not doing the same. After the
last war one of our officers asked a Maori chief why it was that when he
had command of a certain road he did not attack the ammunition and
provision trains. ' Why, you fool!' answered the Maori, much astonished,
'if we had stolen your powder and food, how could you have fought ?'

"Once when one chief insulted another, the latter remarked that if
chief number one had not known his own superiority in arms and am--
munition, he would not have dared to behave in such a manner. There-
upon chief number one divided his fighting material into two equal
parts, and sent one part to his enemy with an invitation to war.

" Sometimes two villages would get up a little war, and after
fighting each other all day, the inhabitants would come out of their
forts towards evening and talk' over the day'svsport in the most friend-
ly way. The next morning they would
begin again, and keep it up during the
daytime, to meet in the evening for a.
social conference. An old missionary
used to tell how, in one of these local
wars, he had known the defenders of a
fort to send out to their assailants that mom wn nuns.
they were short of provisions, and the
latter would immediately send in a supply of food. The same mission-
ary said he had performed divine service one Sunday between two hos-
tile forts, the inhabitants of which came out to worship, meet in the most
perfect amity, and return, to resume fighting on Monday morning.

" It is estimated," said the gentleman, "that between the years 1820
and 1840 more than thirty thousand Maoris perished in these inter-tribal
wars. Many perished in the wars with the English, and many others
have died in consequence of their contact with civilization, as in the
islands of the Pacific, seine from intemperance, and others from small-
pox, measles, and kindred diseases, which were brought here by the
whites. At present wars among them have ceased, cannibalism is un-
known, fully one-half of the adults can read and write, and two-thirds
of them belong to the churches."

AFTER a glance at the interior of Auckland, our friends naturally
turned their attention to its surroundings. They were reminded
of Naples, as Auckland is in a. region of extinct volcanoes, one of. which,
Mount Eden, rises only a mile from the city. Following the advice of
the landlord of the hotel, they drove thither, passing numerous villas of
the well-to-do residents, with which the sides of the mountain are dotted.
From the edge of the crater there is a fine view of the city and its sur-
roundings, and the view takesin several volcanoes.

 

LAKE IN THE CRATE]! OF AN EXTINCI' VOLCAXO.

The Maoris had formerly a fortification on the top of the mountain;
it surrounded the crater, so that a whole tribe could be concealed there,
if necessary, for purposes of defence. Frank and Fred traced out some
of the terraces that formed the original fortification, and Doctor Bron-
son said the works showed a. good deal of military skill.THE KAURI PINE 0F AUCKLAND. ' 199

Within a. radius of ten miles of the city no less then sixty-two
points of eruption have been found, the greater part of them being only
insignifith cones or hills. The largest and best specimen of the ex-
tinct volcanoes of Auckland is Rangitoto, which rises from a great mass
of black lava, presenting a forbidding appearance. Unfortunately for
the beauty of the landscape, the forest that once covered this region has
been nearly all cut or burned away, and Auckland will doubtless regret
in the near future the desolation which her settlers have made.

The youths were anxious to see the famous Kauri pine (Demure
Amt/minis), which is confined wholly to Auckland, and is the most
renowned of New Zealand trees. Before returning to the city they
were driven where they saw a
single specimen, and before their
departure from the district they
had the satisfaction of seeing a
Kauri forest. Frank's note on
this subject is interesting, and
we are permitted to quote it:

" The peculiarity of the Kan-
ri pine is that the trunk does not
appear to diminish in size from
the ground to where the limbs
begin 'to spread. We saw some
trees more than two hundred
feet high; they were eight or
nine feet in diameter at the base,
and had no limbs within forty or
fifty feet of the ground. They
reminded us of the famous big
trees of California, but were tall-
er in proportion to their diame~
ter. We don't think we ever
sa'v more graceful trees any. SAWING A KAURI Pl. .
where. 'They' haven't a great
deal of foliage, and it grows in little tufts very much like bushes.

"The wood is full of gum, and is very valuable as timber. They
told us it was the finest wood in the world for shingles, as the gum pre-
served it from the effects of the weather. A great deal of the lumber
from the Kauri pine is shipped to other parts of New Zealand, and also
to Australia, China, Feejee, and other places where it can find a market.
 

STOCK-PAR)! IN THE SUBURM.

Many of the sticks have been sent to England to serve as masts and
spars for her Majesty's ships of war, and altogether the trade in Kauri
lumber is very large. The result is, a great deal has been cut away,
and the time is not very distant when the Kauri forests will be gone.

"While we were walking among the Kauri trees our guide prodded
the earth with a spear that he carried, and he kept doing this so fre-
quently that we asked what it meant. He answered that he was look-
ing for Kauri gum, and after a time he struck a hard substance, which
he dug down to and brought to light.

"It was a lump of Kauri gum, and looked more like amber than
anything else; in fact, it is said to be used very often in place of amber
for the mouth-pieces of pipes and cigar-holders, and for other purposes
where amber is ornamental. It is worth eight or ten cents a pound, and
the shipment of Kauri gum from Auckland amounts to nearly a million
dollars annually.

" 'How do you get the gum ?' one of us inquired of the man who
was showing us through the forest.

" ' In just the way you see,' he replied. ' The gum cannot be obtainedTREES or NEW ZEALAND. 201

from the tree by any process of tapping or reducing from the wood.
The tree falls and dies, and then, when it decays, the gum collects in
lumps in the ground. It takes years and years for it to collect, and
this little lump, which I have just taken from the ground, has probably
been lying here for centuries. A new forest has risen where the old
one stood, and has taken a long, long while to grow.'

"We asked what other timber-trees there were in New Zealand,
and our infonnant mentioned the Kahikatea, or white pine; the Rimu,
or red pine; the Totara, which is claimed to be i1npe1vious to the at-
tacks of the teredo; and the 'l'anekaha, which has a handsome, close-
grained, and durable wood, and whose bark furnishes a strong dye.
Then there is the Matai, which is much like the English yew, and is
used for making furniture; the Miro, which has a beautiful red fruit
on which pigeons grow fat; and the Kawaka, which has a remarka-
ble leaf and a durable wood.

" There is a great variety

of tree-ferns, some of them

are strangers to us at home.
Peaches, apples, apricots, figs, oranges, strawberries, pears, and other
fruits are abundant in their seasons, and some of them reach a lux-
uriance and perfection surpassing that of the countries whence they
came.

" Near the Kauri forest we were shown a Maori pelt, or fort, that is
said to have been the scene of severe fighting in the early days of the
colony. While we were looking at it a man joined our group, and our
guide told us he was a pal-em Maori. You will wonder, as we did,
what a pakeha Maori is. '

 

A PAKBIIA MAORI.

" Well, he's a white man who lives among the Mam-is, and. in former
times, before the colonization, there was a goodly number of them, for
the simple reason that unless a man was a missionary he couldn't easily
stay in the country without living among the natives Pakeha means
stranger, and is applied to any white man, and a. pakeha Maori is a white
man living among the natives. The tribes were very desirous of hav-
ing pakehas among them, for the reason that they could learn useful
matters from them, but more particularly they could buy muskets, gun-
powder, tools, and other trade goods, of which they were in great need.
A pakeha who had trade goods was always welcome, but a man Who
had nothing was of little consequence, and sometimes had a hard strug-
gle to keep his head on his shoulders.

" With a judicious present of a few shillings we got on the right side
of this man, and induced him to talk about What he had seen or knew
among the Maoris. I have written down some of the things he said.
I can't vouch that they are all absolutely correct; but his statements
are corroborated by intelligent white men who have long lived in the
country."

Here we will close Frank's journal for a few minutes and listen to
the pakeha Maori.

"You see I'm an old man; I came here when I was very young, and
have seen a. great many changes. I was in Sydney, and heard New
Zealand was a good place for trade, so I loaded some goods on a schooner
that was coming this way, and in due time was landed in the coun-
try. At first I made my home with one of the Whites, who had come
here before me and got on friendly terms with the tribe where he lived;
it didn't take long to do it, as the Maoris were very anxious to buy my
goods."

 

A "mu mom's noun.

Frank asked what goods they wanted most.

" Muskets and ammunition," was the reply, " and for these they paid
fabulous prices in wild flax, which was the principal product worth
shipping away. They were constantly at war, and the" tribe that pos-
sessed the white man's weapons could destroy any tribe that was with-
out them. This happened in many cases, and whole tribes who were
without guns were destroyed by their more fortunate adversaries. They
were literally eaten up, as the natives were cannibals in those times.
" To get muskets they impoverish themselves, neglecting their agri-
culture in order to gather flax to buy them with, and literally starving
themselves. Many died of starvation in consequence, and in another
way muskets proved the death of those who owned them. In the times
of clubs and spears the Mam-is had their pahs and villages on high hills,

where the air was pure and the ground dry; when they got muskets
they moved into the low ground, where they were carried off by the
dampness and its consequent fevers. I have known whole villages and
tribes killed in this way, so that not one man, woman, or child remained.
The musket was as fatal to those who owned it as to those who did
not; it was deadly either way.

"Now about some of the customs of the Maoris. They used to be
tattooed very finely, and some of the fighting-men were beautiful to '
look at. The warriors used to bring back the heads of those they killed
' in battle, and some of the traders got to buying these heads provided
they were finely tattooed. They gave a. musket for a good head, and as
soon as this was known some of the tribes began to make war on others
just for the sake of getting tattooed heads to sell.

" You may think it strange, gentlemen," said the pakeha, "but I've
known the head of a live man to be sold and paid for beforehand, and
afterwards honestly delivered according to the agreement; and oneTHE LAW or menu. 205

time when the heads of warriors were not equal to the demand for
them, some of the chiefs tattooed the faces of several slaves whom they
intended to kill whenever the traders arrived who had agreed to buy
the heads. But the slaves were not faithful to their masters, as they all
ran away into the bushes just as the inflammation in their faces was
passing away and they were getting in good condition to be market-
able.

"They had the tabu in its most rigid form here," he continued;
"but as you probably learned all about it in the South Sea islands I
won't take your time to talk about it.

"Another curious custom of the Maoris was the mum; ,' the word
means 'plunder'-- and some folks might call it robbery, which it
amounted to, though it was the custom, and practically the law of the
country. .

"If a man's child fell into the fire and was severely or perhaps fatal-
ly burned, he was plundered of nearly everything he possessed, and the
same was the case if his canoe upset
while he was fishing, or any other no
cident happened to him. The people
of the tribe assembled and gave him
notice that they would be there for
the muru on a particular day. He
prepared a great. feast for them, and
after the feast they sacked his house
and carried away pretty nearly every-
thing he had. Sometimes he did not "
have enough left to live upon, but he
had the opportunity of getting even
by joining in a muru against some
body else. These performances were
never opposed, and in fact a man
would feel insulted if a serious acci-
dent of any kind happened to him mom "mome-
and no notice was taken of it. The
greater the robbery, the greater the honor conferred upon the victim.

" If a man killed another through malice and with deliberate intent,
the act was generally considered of no consequence, or it might even be
meritorious. If it was his own slave that he killed, it was considered
his personal affair entirely; if the victim was of another tribe, it was a
matter of tribal revenge or retaliation; and if of his own tribe he would

be defended by his family or section, and nothing came of it. But if he
killed a. man of his own tribe by accident, such as the discharge of a.
gun, then the law of muru had full force, and the man and all his rela-
tives were plundered of everything they possessed."

Fred asked if the Maoris were given to the ordinary kind of thiev-
ing, like most savage nations.

"Much less than you might suppose," was the reply. "Of course
there were pilferers; but, on the whole, private property was pretty
safe from burglary and sneak-thieving. The mnrn gave an opportunity
for plundering, and so did the warfare between the tribes; but a man
could exempt himself from the murn if he wished, by giving up all
claims to its advantages on his own account. When I first came to
New Zealand I was the subject of a. muru, and afterwards joined in one
upon a Maori friend; but I found so many disadvantages, losing soHUMAN sncnmcns AMONG THE moms. 207

much more than I gained, that I stipulated to have nothing to do with
these affairs in future.

"In actual honesty the Maoris have been injured by their contact
with Europeans. They will steal and do other improper things more
than formerly; but against this we must ofl'set the abolition of slavery,
cannibalism, tribal wars, polygamy, and many of their superstitious
and cruel practices. When anything is stolen from you the chief can
recover it, and will do so if you apply to him. Custom requires that
you should tell him to keep it as a reward for his trouble, and so you
don't gain much by the recovery of the plunder. '

" They were not favored by nature," continued their historian, " as
they did not have the bread-fruit, banana, and cocoa-tree to supply
them with food, and they did not even have the pig until it was given
to them by Captain Cook. Dogs and rats were their only quadrupeds,
and they ate both. The native ' '
dogs are extinct, as the Maoris did
not care to preserve them when
pigs became plentiful.

"It used to be the custom to
make human sacrifices on the death
of a chief; prisoners of war were
used for this purpose, their blood
being sprinkled on'the grave, and
the flesh roasted and eaten. There
was a grand feast at a funeral, and
even now this custom is kept up,
though they have no longer any
human sacrifices. The festivities "mm WK'S "1"" 1deg "'3 "W"

at a Maori funeral are very much

like those of an Irish 'wake,' and something like an Arab burial cere-
mony. They eat and drink all they can get, and the mourning is per-
formed by the women, who howl and cry for hours, simply because it is .
the custom to do so." '

As the time of our friends was limited, they bade adieu to the
pakeha Maori, and left him to meditate upon the changes that had
taken place since his advent into New Zealand.

"He might have told you," said their guide, "that the native rat
has been killed off by the European one, which was introduced from
ships, and the European housefly has driven away the native blue
blow--fly. The foreign clover is killing the ferns, and European grasses
generally are supplanting the native ones very rapidly. The English
sparrow has become very common in New Zealand, and will doubtless
destroy some of the native birds."

Fred asked about the birds of the country, but his informant could
not describe them with any degree of accuracy. Later the youth
learned that there are one hundred and thirtysix varieties in all, of
which seventy-three are land birds. One of these, the Apteryx, or
Kiwi, is Wingless, and lives in the mountains. He is very scarce, and
only rarely captured or even seen. There are six varieties of parrots,
and two of falcons--one about the size of a pigeon, and the other a. very
active and industrious sparrow-hawk. There is one owl, and there is a.
blackbird, which is called the "person bir " by the settlers, for the
reason that it has two white feathers under its chin like the ends of a.
clergyman's necktie.

Fred asked if New Zealand was not the home of the now extinct
Dinornis, the largest bird of which we have any positive knowledge.

"Yes," replied his informant; "the bird was called Mac by the
natives, and it is pretty clearly established that he was abundant
when the Maoris came here, but was wiped out of existence some two
hundred years ago. Skeletons of the Moa have been found, and show
that the largest of these birds must have attained a height of fourteen
to sixteen feet."

"Were they dangerous?" was the very natural query which fol-
lowed. .

"Not by any means; they were Wingless, and belonged to the os-
trich family, and the naturalists say they were stupid birds, that could
easily fall a prey to man. This fact accounts for their extinction in the
first two' or three centuries of the presence of the Maoris in New Zea-
land. It is fortunate that their skeletons have been preserved in the
earth, so that we can. know positively that mch great birds existed."

" How do you know the Maoris lived upon these birds '4"

" Partly through their traditions, and partly from the discovery of
many of the bones of the M021. in the ovens and in the heaps of rubbish
around the ruins of ancient villages. The natives devoured any birds
they could catch; parrots, pigeons, person-birds, anything and every-
thing edible was legitimate food. 'Those that dwelt on the coast lived
chiefly on a fish diet, and those in the interior made annual or more
frequent migrations to the seaside for purposes of fishing. The rivers
abound in eels, and they grow to an enormous size; I have seen eels
weighing fifty pounds each, and have heard of larger ones."209.

Frank asked what the clothing of the natives was made of before
the Europeans came to the country.

" It was made from the fibre of the flax," was the reply. "There
are several kinds of flex, and it grows everywhere and near every vil-
lage. Not only did it supply the material for garments, but for nets,.

 

DRESING FLAX.

baskets, lines, mats, dishes, oordage, and other things. They used cords
made from it for binding the walls and roofs of their houses together,
and thus made it serve in 'place of nails. Great quantities of flax are
raised here nowadays, as you will understand when you know there are
some forty and odd flax-mills in the colony, and considerable flax is
exported every year. '

" Most of the Maoris that you will see during your stay in New Zea,--

;
land wear clothes of European style, as they find them more convenient
than the cloaks and mats of former days. On ceremonial occasions the
old finer-y is displayed, and the cloaks of some of the chiefs are really
magnificent. Cloaks and mats or blankets were the ordinary dress, one
mat being wrapped around the waist, and the other thrown over the
shoulder. Men were their mats on the right shoulder, and women on

' the left, and they sometimes adorned their heads with the gayest feath-
ers they could find. Children went naked in their early years, except
in the coldest weather, when they wrapped themselves in any old gar-
ments they could lay hands on."

The youths learned many other things about the Maoris, but we _
have not room for all the notes they made on the subject. Frank asked
particularly about the marriage ceremonies of the natives, probably for
the information of his young lady friends at home. He learned that
children might be betrothed by their parents when very young, or if not
so betrothed they could marry very much as in civilized lands. Some-
times the parents and families,.and more frequently the whole tribe,
discussed any proposed match, and made all sorts of hinderances to it.
Courtship was begun by the girl quite as often as by the young man,
and when marriage was decided there were great preparations for a fes-
tivity, and the bride and bridegroom were provided with new mats and
many other articles of household use. The funny part of the business
was thatduring the marriage-feast everything movable was carried
away by the friends, under the law of muru already described. The
young couple started in life with nothing except the clothes they wore
and the house that had been built for them.

During their stay at Auckland our friends visited some of the islands
in the bay, including that of Kawau, where Sir George Grey, a former
governor of New Zealand, has a fine residence. The house is quite
English in appearance and character, and contains a good museum of
Maori and other curiosities. The grounds around the house abound in
pheasants of several kinds from Europe and Asia, kangaroos from Aus-
tralia, treekangaroos from New Guinea, and several members of the-
deer family. Near Kawau they saw a fleet of boats manned by Maoris
engaged in the capture of sharks. The creatures they pursued were not
the ordinary shark, which is abundant in New Zealand waters, but a
smaller variety measuring about six feet in length.

As the sharks were hauled into the boats they were killed by sharp
blows upon the nose, and then flung into the hold. When a boat was
filled it proceeded to an island, where the prizes were hung up to dry;

\
and Frank was told that from twelve to twenty thousand of these
sharks are taken in the bay of Waitamata every year, and either dried
for winter food or eaten fresh. Out of curiosity our friends took a
luncheon of shark steak, which had been baked on a hot stone after the

native fashion. They found it palatable, but rather tasteless, and so
dry that Fred suggested oiling each mouthful, or smothering it with
butter. It was unanimously voted that shark with the Mam-is was
not half as enjoyable as salmon with the Indians of the Columbia
River, or shad with the fishermen of Delaware Bay.

More palatable than shark steak were the oysters which abound
in the bay The island of Kawau has a coast- line of about thirty miles,
and all around it there are oyster-beds, some of them of great extent.
Not only do the oysters grow on the rocks and in the water, but they
cling to the overhanging limbs of the trees, and grow there quite con-

ing of the tide. Frank and Fred found the oysters of good flavor,
and soon became quite expert at opening the shells with the oyster-
_ knives which were opportunely brought along in the boat.

" Don't fail to visit the gold-mines and the Hot Lake district," was
the injunction repeatedly made to Doctor Bronson and his young com-
panions. As soon as they had exhausted the sights of Auckland and
its neighborhood they proceeded to follow the foregoing advice.

First in order were the Thames gold-fields. A steamer carried them
in five hours from Auckland to Grahamstown, and as soon as they were
on shore they began their inspection of the mines. There are no
placer diggings here, the mining being almost entirely confined to the
veins of quartz in the mountains, which rise abruptly from the shore

of the bay on which Grahamstown is built. For this reason Grahams-
town, which takes its name from Robert Graham, its founder, has a
more permanent and substantial appearance than the ordinary town
in a newly opened mining country. It lies along the shore of the
bay, and the numerous reduction-works, founderies, and similar estab'
lishments were suggestive of a manufacturing centre rather than a.
mining one only a few years old.
Doctor Bronson had a. letter of introduction to a. gentleman inter-
ested in one of the largest mines, and the trio of travellers were at once
made welcome. Clad in appropriate costumes, they were taken into the
mine, where they walked a. long distance through a, tunnel, and were
then conducted through a. perfect maze of shafts and levels, where the

workmen were busily occupied in removing the auriferous rock, which
was carried directly to the reduction-works, where it was crushed and
the precious metal extracted. The gold contains a. large amount----
thirty per cent--of silver, and consequently has an appearance of pal-
lor when turned out from the retorts. As the work of gold-mining
has been described elsewhere in the wanderings of the boy travellers,
it is hardly necesSary to give it here, the processes of mining and reduc-
tion being practically the same all over the world.

Frank and Fred obtained the following information relative to gold-
mining in New Zealand, and especially in the region now under con-
sideration: '

" Goldqnining in New Zealend properly dates from 1861, when gold
was discovered by Mr. Gabriel Read at Tuapeka, in the province of
Otago. The existence of the precious metal was known nine or tenGOLD--MINING IN NEW ZEALAND. 215

years before that date, it having been found at Coromandel by a. Mr.
Ring, who reported his discovery to the authorities at Auckland. Since
1861 it has been found in many places, and is now an important indus-
try of the country. Some of the mines are wholly alluvial, or placer,
diggings, others are Wholly quartz-mines, which are called reefs in New
Zealand and Australia, and others are combinations of alluvial and
quartz mining. A

"For the enlightenment of some of my younger readers I will here
explain that alluvial, or placer, mines are those where the gold is found

 

" station A rocxsr."

in the earth or soil and is separated from it by washing. Quartz-mines
are those where the gold is in the ledges of the mountains and requires
to be removed by tunnelling or blasting, or both. The rock containing
the rock must be crushed to powder, and the gold separated from the
powder by washing and mingling it with quicksilver. Quartz-mining
requires a great deal of money to carry it on; so much, indeed, that it
is generally conducted by companies, and these companies, it is proper
to say, very often take more from the pockets of the stock-holders
than they do from the mines. Alluvial diggings are the resort of the
poor man, who needs only pick, shovel, and pan to set him up in busi-
ness.

" During the year ending March 31, 1886, the mines of New Zealand
yielded 233,068 ounces of gold, which was valued at more than four
millions of dollars; at least this was the amount entered at the custom--
house for exportation; some was doubtless absorbed in the colony, but '
no one can tell how much.

"The yield of the Thames district for the same time was 61,939
ounces, or more than one-fourth the entire amount for the colony.
During the month of May, 1886, 3039 ounces of gold were taken from
2574: tons of rock. Some of the mines have paid good dividends to
their owners, but others have never made any returns. The ups and
downs of mining in New Zealand are about the same as in other parts
of the world.

" There are nearly five hundred mining companies registered in New
Zealand, with a paid-up capital of about ten million dollars. Down to.
the end of 1885 more than two hundred million dollars' worth of gold
had been exported from New Zealand, so that there can be no question
of the importance of the colony as a mining region. According to the
oficial returns there are more than eleven thousand men engaged in
mining; two thousand of these are quartz-miners, and the rest, includ--
ing three thousand Chinese, are in the placer mines.

" The placer miners do not confine themselves to the valleys of the
rivers among the mountains, but seek gold along the west shore, where
they find it under the bowlders and other stones embedded in the sand
of the beaches. The popular idea is that this gold is washed up from
the sea during severe gales; the scientific men say it is really washed
up by the lifting power of the waves on the sand that has been brought
down by the rivers and drifted along the shore. Some of this gold is
obtained by washing the sands in sluice-boxes, just as in operations
among the mountains; and deposits, or ' pockets,' are occasionally dis-
covered in the sand under the loose stones. Sometimes these deposits
are of considerable value, and we have been told of a miner who found
a single pocket containing nearly thirty ounces of gold. Similar pock--LOCATION OF THE PRINCIPAL GOLD--MINES. 217

ets exist in the mountains, and it is the height of a miner's ambition to
find a well-filled one and secure its contents without anybody's help.

" The alluvial mines in North Island are less extensive than those of
South Island. It is estimated that these mines cover an area of twenty
thousand square miles in South Island alone, and as very little capital
is required for working them, they are more popular than the others.

"The principal quartz--mines are in the Coromandel and Thames dis-
tricts; the reefs have been prospected to six or eight hundred feet
below the searlevel, and also to a. height of two thousand feet above it.

 

GOLD-MINING ON THE SBA-SHORE.

In some places the rock has yielded six hundred ounces to the ton; at
least it has assayed to that extent, but the amount obtained upon work-
ing it in quantities is far less. Of course such rock as this is a rare
exception in New Zealand as everywhere else.

" In the province of Otago there are rich reefs, and in some places
gold has been found at elevations of six and seven thousand feet above
the sea. The highest mine in New Zealand is on the summit of Ad-
vance Peak, near Lake Wakatipu, in South Island.

"The mines have been beneficial to the country in two ways: first
 

A NINER'S CAMP IN' THE MOUNTAINS.

by the yield of gold, and secondly by attracting attention and emigrsr
tion to New Zealand. Like the colonies of Australia, New Zealand
offers inducements to emigrants, and is very desirous of_ promoting emi-
gration from the overcrowded countries of the Old World. An agent-
general is maintained in London, and a vast amount of printed matter
setting forth the advantages of the colony to actual settlers is issued
annually from his oflice. Emigrants with families are carried to New
Zealand at a reduced rate of fare, and at one time they were trans-
ported almost free of charge, so anxious was the Colonial Government
to increase its population. The colony now has nearly if not quite six
hundred thousand inhabitants, which is certainly a' good showing when
we remember that the settlement had its beginning in 1840, when its
first governor came out from Euglanc ."

Our friends remained at Grahamstown over Sunday, and observed a
state of affairs which was an improvement over that of American min-
ing towns in general on the first day of the week. All work was sus-
pended, and the whole population turned out in its best clothes. There
are churches of nearly every denomination at Grahamstown, and allON THE ROAD TO THE HOT LAKES. 219

were well filled with worshippers; one of the churches has a stained-
glass window which cost some fifteen hundred dollars--certainly an un-
usual sight for a mining town.

Monday was spent among the hills and in the mines of the Thames,
and the youths retired to bed that night thoroughly wearied with the
exertions of the day. On Tuesday the party returned to Auckland, and
immediately arranged for a. visit to the Hot Lake district. .The trip
was planned as follows: Their heavy baggage was sent by steamerto
Tauranga, which is on the east coast, and the nearest port to the district
they were to visit. Then, with only their hand-bags and some rough
garments and necessities for mountain travel, the trio proceeded by rail,
coach, and horseback to their destination. By this plan they were
enabled to see the country and avoid travelling the same route twice
over. The route for the ease--loving tourist is from Tauranga. by coach
to the Hot Lakes, 3. distance of about fifty miles, and back again over the
same route. It is proper to say that travellers who come as far as New
Zealand for the sake of sight-seeing are greatly disinclined to repetition,

and nearly all visitors go by one route and return over another. The
Government has established a. sanatorium and laid out a town in the
centre of the Hot Lake district. It isbuilding a railway from Oxford
to this town, and the promise is confidently made that by the end of
1888 travellers may go by train from Auckland direct to the Hot Lakes
without the fatigue of a coach-ride over the present rough road.

"We had a charming ride," said Frank, "over the railway to Ox-
ford, where we took the coach in the direction of the famous region of
New,Zealand geysers. Much of the country through which the rail-
way passes resembles England both in scenery and products; English
fruit-trees grow well here, and English grasses seem adapted to the soil.
American pines have been introduced and are doing well; they make a
pleasing contrast to the New Zealand wattletree and cabbage-palm and
the ferns which abound everywhere. The country is thinly settled, but
will undoubtedly support a large population in course of time. Villages
with European houses alternate with Maori encampments, the latter
abounding with lazy aboriginals.

" One of the advantages claimed for New Zealand 15 its similarity to
England' in climate and products, with the great point in its favor that
while the climate has all the mildness of that of England it lacks its
severity. The average temperature of London is said to be seven de-
grees colder than that of North Island, and four degrees colder than
the temperature of South Island.

"They tell 11's that snow seldom lies on the ground at the sea-level
on North Island, and not very often on South Island; but the summit

I of Ruapehu, the highest mountain in North Island, and also the tops of

L the peaks of the great mountain chains in South Island, are perpetually
coveled with snow. The snow line is about seven thousand five hun-
dred feet high.

"The sun was shining brightly and there was a genial warmth to
the air when we left Auckland, but within an hour we were in a tenific
rain that beat heavily against the windows of the railway--can'iage and
pattered like hail on the roof. 'This is our one drawback,' said a gen-
tleman who accompanied us, when the rain began to fall. 'The changes
of weather and temperature in New Zealand are very sudden. The
alternations from heat to cold, from sunshine to storm, from calms to
gales, are so frequent and marked as to defy calculation and prevent
our saying with truthfulness that there is any uniformly wet or dry
season throughout the year.'

"Then he went on to say that compared with Great Britain the
climate seemed to be far superior when the death-rate was considered.
It was less than eleven in one thousand annually, and lower than in any
.of the colonies of Australia. He claimed that the salubrity of the cli-THE ANNUAL RAINFALL 221

mate was due in great measure to the breezes for which New Zealand is
noted, there being no less than one hundred and twenty-six gales or
high winds in a single year (1885), and good winds for nearly all the
rest of the time. The prevailing winds are from the north-west and
south-west, with occasional storms from the opposite quarters. The '
annual rainfall is twenty-eight inches at Auckland, thirty-six inches at
Wellington, and twenty-five inches at Dunedin, and. there is more rain
on the east coast than on the wes ."

"THE volcanic region of North Island is a large one," wrote Frank

in his journal, " and as I can't find any two persons who agree
as to its extent, I won't attempt to give its area in square miles or acres;
but it is large enough to meet the wants of everybody, and hot enough
to suit the most fastidious.

. "Long before you reach the neighborhood of the Hot Lakes you
find steaming springs, and there is hardly one of them that is not cred--
ited with some wonderful healing properties. - On an area. of a. hundred
and fifty square miles there are many thousands of hot springs of all
temperatures from tepid to boiling, and of all sorts of composition.
Only a few have been analyzed, but enough .of them to show that
hardly any two are alike. All the mineral springs of the world seem
to be represented in this district, and when they have been properly
catalogued they will form a. sanatorium to which the entire globe can
send its invalids for relief and healing.

" To make a list of the chemicals they hold in solution would be to
copy the index of an exhaustive work on chemistry, and therefore I
refrain.

" These springs have been the resort of the Maoris for centuries, and
for white people ever since New Zealand could boast a white popula-
tion. Wonderful cures are recorded or reported, but it is evident that
an invalid should have the advice of a competent physician before tryingCURATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE HOT SPRINGS. 223

the springs in earnest. To come here and take the baths indiscriminate-
1y, when the number and variety are so great, would be much like tum-

, ing one's self loose in a drug-store and tasting the contents of all the
jars in succession. Thus far the principal diseases treated have been
gout and rheumatism, and many a sufferer has found relief and been
cured of his malady. One hath has been so successful in curing skin
diseases that it is known as the ' pain-killer ;' its ingredients are sulphate
of potash, sulphate of soda, chlorides of sodium, calcium, magnesia, and
iron, silica, hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and traces of alu-
mina, lithium, and iodine. What disease could stand such a combina-
tion as that?

 

AMONG THE HOT SPRINGS.

" Most of the villages are near hot springs, not so much for the cura-
tive properties of the waters as for the convenience of cooking food
without the trouble of collecting fuel, or even building a fire. At one
village where we stopped for dinner there were twelve or fifteen springs
of all temperatures from tepid to boiling; we bathed in one spring
while the potatoes for our dinner were being boiled in another not a
dozen yards away. Around the springs, and along the path by which

we walked from them to the house, there were cracks and holes in the
ground from which steam issued, and occasionally little jets of boiling
water. It gave us an uncanny feeling to walk along this path, and
we agreed that it was not a nice place for promenading in the dark.
"The proprietor of the hotel accompanied us, and said it was not
safe to stray from the path, as one was liable to break through the
thin crust and find his feet plunged into hot water which had accumu-
lated beneath the surface. He showed us a pool which is the special
resort of the Maoris, and where half a dozen of them were bathing, the
bathers being watched by as many more of their kinsmen, who were
squatted on flat stones erected over the steam-jets at the edge of theNEW ZEALAND GEYSERS. 225

pool. The temperature of the water is about ninety degrees, but it rises
occasionally to a, hundred and more.' We found a secluded pool, and
took a, bath there; after the bath we greatly enjoyed a. luscious melon
which our host brought us.
"It is a, curious sensation to stand on a. hill and look over a. consid-
. emble area, of country which may easily be imagined to be undergoing
a. cooking process from one end to the other. Jets of steam rise from
the ground in a great many places; some of them continuously, others

in quick or slow jets, and with intervals of a. second or so, or perhaps
fractions of a. second, and others with dignified intervals of several min:
utes. Some of the geysers threw up columns of water fifteen or twenty
feet in height; but, on the whole, they were lws interesting than the
geysers of Yellowstone Park in America. At one place the sulphur
fumes were so stifling that it was next to impossible to look into the
holes in the ground, and only possible by holding the nose firmly and
looking while the breath was retained.
15
" And these sulphur fumes came very near causing a horrible death
to Fred. We were among the boiling springs, where the greatest pre-
caution was necessary to avoid falling into the pools, as they were only
short distances apart, sometimes less than a foot. Our guide had called
attention to one of the geyser holes, where the water at the bottom was
boiling furiously. Fred was looking into it, when suddenly there rose a
puff of sulphur that half stifled him. He sprang backward as he threw
his head in the air, and in doing so stepped within three inches of the
edge of a pool of water that was quiescent, though almost at the boil-
ing-point. Had he fallen into it he would have been scalded to death
in a few moments.

" Accidents of this sort are by no means uncommon. A child of the
hotel-keeper fell into a pool a few months ago, and was scalded so badly
that it died within an hour. They told how a native woman dropped
her baby from her arms; it fell into a pool of scalding water by the
side of the path. The woman went in to rescue it, and both mother and
child were drowned in the pool. Men, horses, and dogs have fallen into
these pools, or more frequently broken through the thin crust that lies
above the accumulated hot water or hot mud beneath the surface.

" One Maori village where we stopped is so completely built on a
volcanic foundation that the steam rises in every house; and the little
open space in the centre, where the village councils are held, is half paved
with broad stones, which are all kept warm by steam from the earth.
Close to the village are several mud-baths, where one may sit up to his
neck in hot mud for hours, and then wash off the adhesive stuff in a
neighboring pool. These solfatm'ae, or mud-baths, are very numerous,
and in many instances very dangerous. Where they are small the hot
mud simply boils and bubbles, and slowly oozes out of the ground; and
the chief danger lies in breaking through the crust near them and find-
ing yourself plunged in the scalding mush. The larger solfataras are
like the mouth of a well, the mud bubbling up in the centre and form-
ing a ring of dirt that solidifies and oflers a good footing, so far as the
eye can perceive; but woe betide the unfortunate stranger who vent-
ures to step upon it; the crust gives way, and he will be fortunate if he
escapes with his life.

"We reached Rotomahana, the famous little lake of this district,
without accident, although it was evening when we got there. We
were lodged in a Maori wILao-rz , or house, close to Te Tarata, or The
White Terraces, and we had a glimpse of the terraces through the
indistinetness of the evening. There were steam and water jets allham

around, and the potatoes for our supper were boiled in one of the-
natural caldrons, free of charge. To boil vegetables in one of these:
springs all you have to do is to enclose them in a net of hemp or flax
and lower them into the water. When they have been there long-
enough take them out, and that's all there is about it. What a nice
thing it would be to have a natural hot spring at your door, provided
you could escape the other inconveniences connected with it!

" We bathed in a pool and also in the lake, the latter, though warm,
being less so than the pool. The ground was warm, and made the
atmosphere of the house too hot for comfort; and altogether we passed
an uncomfortable night. Next morning we were up bright and early,
to look at the terraces; and of all the wonderful things in the world,
there are few that can surpass them.

"The White Terraces are on this side of the little lake, and the Pink
Terraces on the other. Imagine, if you can, a series of irregular steps
of silver or alabaster, or polished marble, about three hundred feet from
side to side, and rising about two hundred feet from theshore of the
lake. These steps or terraces have been formed by the crystallization
of the silica contained in the hot water in the boiling lake above;
the hot water holds it in solution, and as its temperature falls the
silica is released and deposited.

"In the sunlight the terraces glistened and sparkled like a collection
of all the precious stones in the world, and the picture was fascinating
in the extreme. We ascended from the base to the edge of the boiling
lake, where the terraces begin. Our guides cautioned us that We must
expect to walk continually in the water which flowed over the terraces,
but as the surface is soft and smooth we dotted our boots and encased
our feet in moccasins, or shoes of untanned skin. The water at the
bottom of the terraces is tepid; but each successive stage finds it hot-
ter, and at last it is too much so for comfort. On one terrace after the
other you find delightful tubs suitable for bathing; we should have
bathed in them, but had been told to wait for the Pink Terraces, on the
other side of the lake, where the baths are finer. There is just enough
softness to the surface formed by the silica to make it pleasant to the
touch and entirely safe to walk on without danger of slipping.

"Not only are the terraces beautiful, but the ornamentation which
has been made by the hand of Nature, busily working here through
many centuries, is beautiful in the extreme. The hanging ornaments
and cornices at the outer edges of the terraces and on the rims of the
baths surpass the work of the most gifted designer or the most vividA WONDER OF THE "01' LAKE DISTRICT.

imagination. Description by words is out of the question, and I must
fall back on the picture which I send with this.

" The boiling lake at the top of the White Terraces is a pool perhaps
a hundred feet in diameter, and varying in height from time to time.
Curiously enough, it changes with the wind, though why the wind
should affect it I am unable to guess. It is boiling, boiling, boiling all
the While, though more furiously at some times than at others. The
water is a. beautiful turquoise blue, and so intense is the blue that it:
- reflects upon the cloud of steam that rises from the lake. In fact, nearly
all the hot springs in this region are blue, and the color is perceptible
at very slight depths. '

"We wanted to spend a whole day here; but time pressed, and we
descended to the lake again and crossed to the Pink Terraces The
lake is a tiny one, only a mile in length by half a mile in width.

" The Pink Terraces are smaller and lower than the White Terraces,
and the spaces between the pools, or bathing-tubs, are not so finely
wrought. The Pink Terraces are really not pink at all, but salmoneol-
cred; the White Terraces have a. tint of sahnon, but it is less pro-
nounced than in the other. The formation is the same in both, and
having described one, it is hardly necessary that I should describe the
other. We were eager for the promised bath, and were not long in
getting at it. And such a bath!

" We undressed on the rocks a. short distance from the foot of the
terrace, and then entered one of the pools. The water was tepid, almost
too warm for thorough enjoyment, but we did not pay much attention
to it. The tub, or pool, was large enough for six or eight persons to
bathe in and have plenty of room, and we splashed and played there-
like dolphins--at least as far as our limited abilities would allow us.
What surprised us most was the wonderful smoothness of the rock. It-
was soft to the feet when We stood upon it, and soft to the hands when
we pressed them on the sides of the bath. We (lashed our bodies with
no light force against the rock, and somehow it seemed to yield, or at-
all events it (lid not hurt us. We went from one bath to another, and
kept ascending till the warmth was more than we could endure. We
sat on the edges of some of these great shell-like baths, and looked
down upon the little lake and over to the White Terraces on the
other side. It was a remarkable sight, and I certainly never heard- of'
any other bathing-tub where there was so much scenery and so much
enjoyment.

" At the top of the Pink Terraces there is a lake similar to the one
A PE'I'RII'IED CASCADE

 

 

m m'x mum uxx mm mm.
that feeds the White Terraces. It is about a quarter of a mile around it,
the water in the lake is all the time boiling, and it has the same blue
color that I have already mentioned. A cloud of steam rose continu-
ally from the surface, and it was only when we got on the windward
side of the lake that we could see the water at all, and then only as the
wind blew the steam away. All around the lake the rocks were in-
crusted with sulphur, and the incrustation continued for a good part
of the way down the slope.

"We brought away some interesting souvenirs of our visit in the
shape of leaves and flowers incrusted with silica, the substance out of
which the terraces have been formed. Leaves, flowers, feathers, sticks,
any small things placed in the water, become incrusted with the silica in
a short time, and are easily preserved by wrapping them in cotton or
other soft substances. A bird dropping in the water becomes, as it were,
petrified, feathers and all: some of the Maoris who live in the neighbor-
hood have adopted the plan of killing small birds, and after stufiing
them with sand or other heavy substance, immersing them in the water
long enough to allow the feathers to be incrusted with silica. We have
bought some of these petrified birds, and find them very pretty and
interesting.

" From the little lake we descended by a small and swift stream to
Lake Tai-awera, which is about seven miles long by four or five in width.
We were in the ordinary canoe of the country, hollowed from the trunk
of a tree, and very ticklish to sit in, as you cannot make the least incli-
nation to one side or the other without risk of overturning. The canoe
which carried us had eight rowers, so that with ourselves and guide we
were twelve in all. The stream connecting the lakes is narrow and
crooked, and so swift that it threatened to dash us on the shore and
smash things generally; but we got through without accident, and then
crossed the lake to the village of Wairoa. On our way we passed near
the foot of Mount Tarawera, a truncated cone about two thousand feet
high, which is considered sacred by the Maoris. They will neither
ascend it nor allow any one else to do so; it is the burial-place of the
Arawa tribe of Maoris and the dwelling-place of one of their tutelary
gods, and for these double reasons it is held in rigid tabu.

" There's another tabu here, and that is on the ducks and other
water-fowl that inhabit the lakes; and as no one is allowed to shoot
them, they are in great numbers. The tabu was removed when the
Duke of Edinburgh came here, and probably any one who would pay a
high price could get it suspended long enough to allow him to satisfydz<d<mx Em: .AO .Smflxmow aux/445'.--

his desires for shooting. But the tabu does not include trapping or
netting, and we had roast ducks for dinner and luncheon on payment of
a few shillings. There is a grand slaughtering festivity in December of
each year, and this is the real reason of enforcing the tabu at other
times.

" Sight-seeing places the world over are the cause of great demoral-
ization to the people that live near them, and the Hot Lake district of
New Zealand is no exception. The Maoris here are as rapzwious as the
hackmen at Niagara Falls, the guides and hotel-keepers at Rome, Naples,
and hundreds of other places on the Continent, or the custodians of the
Taj Mahal at Agra, or the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. ' Every step
we take has a fee of some kind attached to it, and they have even es-
tablished a charge of five pounds (twenty-five dollars) for the privilege
of taking photographs in the Hot Lake district. Miss Cumming, who
wrote "At Home in Fiji" and other interesting books, tells how they

tried to make her pay the photograph fee for taking sketches of the
White Terraces and other curiosities during her visit. She resisted on
the ground that a sketch was not a photograph; but they refused to
listen to her excuses, and threatened to destroy her sketches unless she
paid the sum demanded. She managed, however, to smuggle them
away by concealing the sketches among some rugs, and leaving the dis-
trict under the escort of a. large party of English tourists.

"Wairoa is a. pretty village with some two or three hundred inhab-
itants, most of them Manris, and has a church, a school-house, and twoA FEARFUL EARTHQUAKE AND ERUP'I'ION. 235

hotels for the accommodation of tourists. The church and school are
less prosperous than they used to be, as the natives are not as zealous in
Christianity as when they were first converted. Soon after the Maori
war broke out they hanged one of their pastors, and compelled another
to flee to avoid the same fate?

"We were comfortably lodged at one of the hotels, and the next
morning took the coach for Tauranga, rejecting the advice of several

' Shortly after the visit described above, the famous terraces were destroyed by an
eruption of Mount Tarawera. Soon after midnight of June 10, 1886, loud explosions
were heard and violent earthquakes felt; in a few minutes Mount Tarawera broke out as
an native volcano, hurling ashes, dust, and red-hot stones to a great height, and the whole
sky in all directions seemed to be nflame. The ashes, dust, and mud were distributed over
a wide area of country. some of the dust and ashes falling fifty miles away. The out-
break of Tarawem was followed almost immediately by a terrific outburst at Lake Roto-
mnhana; the water of the lake, with its clny bed and the material of the Pink and White
Terraces, was suddenly blown into the air in the shape of an immense mud-cloud followed
by steam and smoke. The mud-cloud in its descent buried the surrounding country to
various depths, ranging as high as thirty feet. The native villages of Wniroa and Te
Ariki were completely covered, and the village of Mourea was bodily thrown into Lake
Tumwem and swallowed out of sight. Over one hundred persons perished, the most of
them natives. Mr. Hazard, the master of the native school at Wniroa, and four of his
children were among the killed.

It was estimated that fifty square miles of country were covered to a depth of three
feet and more by the mud, ashes, and stones, and sixteen hundred square miles more or
less afiected by the eruption or the deposits from it. Stones weighing half a ton and
upwards were found nine miles from the scene of the explosion, and some within a mile
or less weighed several tons The explosions were heard eighty miles away, and are
described as resembling heavy guns at sea. They continued about three hours, ceasing
before daylight; and the night is well described as a night of terror.
persons who told us we should not fail to see Lake Taupo and Mount
Tong-Miro. The country is desolate, and the most that can be said of
it, so far as we could learn, is that it contains larger geysers and hot
springs than are to be found around Lake Tarawera. There is a hot
river which is fed from boiling springs below it, and Lake Taupo is a
pretty sheet of water twenty-five miles long by twenty in width. Ton-
gariro is an active volcano, much larger than Tarawera, and has been
ascended by very few people. The as-
cent is attended with so many difficul-
ties that we did not care to undertake it,'
and, as we had seen the most interesting
part of the volcanic region of New Zea-
land, we concluded to return.

"The road from Wairoa to Tauranga
was rough, but the strong coach endured
it without injury, and the team of six
horses carried us along at a good pace.
Tauranga has a melancholy history, as it
was the seene of severe fighting in the
Maori war. About four miles from the
town is the celebrated Gate Pah, which
was built by the Maoris as a defiance to
the English, who had a fort at Tauranga.
It was a fortification of double palisades
such as the Maoris usually make, the in-
ner line of palisades being much stronger
than the outer one. Inside the inner line
there is a ditch where the men can stand,
with the earth breast~high in front of
them; and they aim their guns through
loop-holes notched in the logs of the pal-
-' "'0'" "0""? m n": m" "WT"- isades. The outer fence is expected to

delay the assailants sufiiciently long to
enable the defenders to shoot them down. A Maori fort is constructed
with much more military skill than one would expect of a people with-
out any training in engineering work.

" An English officer says'that the salients, angles, ditches, and para-
pets of the Maori pahs greatly astonished the generals who tried to
capture them, and often led to disasters. The Tauranga Gate Pah was
held by about three hundred Maoris, while the English had about sev.d5>>;

enteen hundred men for the attack. They shelled the pah all day with
heavy guns, and about 4 9.11. tried to carry it by assault. They got
inside the pah, and there the soldiers were taken by panic, and retreated
in disorder, leaving the Maoris in possession, though they evacuated the
place in the night. The English lost twenty-seven killed and sixty-six
wounded, and among the dead there were eleven ofiicers.

" We went through the ruins of the pah, and could not understand
how the Maoris were able to stay there in all the rain of shot and shell
that was poured in before the assault. There is a monument at Tau-
ranga to commemorate the event, and an English resident showed us
the little cemetery where those who fell at the Gate Pah were buried.
It is quite close to the sea, and, like English cemeteries generally, is care
fully tended and kept 1n order

' Perhaps you would like to know something of the Maori war, as-
we have had occasion to mention it two or three times. Well, there
was trouble between the natives and the English a few years after the
establishment of the Government at Auckland; it grew out of the im-
position of customs duties and the purchase of land, and the natives
thought they had not been treated properly. There was a good deal of
fighting on a small scale; but after a while peace was established, and
it lasted practically for ten or twelve years.

"But in March, 1860, there were fresh troubles, and from the same
cause as before, or rather from one of the causes, the sale of land. The '
Government had bought some land, for which they paid the man who
claimed to own it; after he had been paid the tribe claimed it, and
because the Government would not pay a second time the tribe declared
war. It was joined by other tribes, and in a very short time a consid-
. erable number of Maori tribes were in full insurrection against the mili-
tary authority. Bishop 'Selwyn and others thought the natives had
been unjustly treated, and there was much dissension among the Euro-
peans as to the right and wrong of the matter.

"The war lasted through 1860, and down to March, 1861, when the
natives, having been several times defeated, ended the trouble by sur-
rendering. Soon after this the Maoris thought they would have a king
of their own, and representatives of some of the tribes assembled and
proclaimed a native sovereignty. Previously to this they had formed a '
league which opposed the sale of land to the white strangers, and this
league was entered into by a good many tribes. The movement for a
king was based on the belief that, as the English had a queen, the Maoris
could have a similar ruler, and so in 1862 a king was chosen.CAUSES on THE MAORI WAR. 239

"War broke out again in May, 1863. Troops were sent from Aus-
tralia. and from England, and a. vigorous attempt was made to suppress
the insurrection. There were many opinions as to the proper policy to
pursue, owing to the differences between English and Maori laws and
customs, and whatever was done by the Governor or the military author-
ities was sure to' receive severe criticism. Sometimes there were long
periods of inaction in which there was much negotiation, which gener-
ally amounted to nothing. The Maoris refused to give up their lands or
arbitrate the questions in dispute, and seemed determined to defend
their homes. They not only repudiated English laws regarding land

tenure, but they started a. movement for reviving their old practices of
paganism, or, rather, setting up a new religion in place of the Christian-
ity which so many of them had adopted.

" Several tribes joined in this movement, and the new religion
spread. It was called the I'ai Marire by its adherents, who are known
as Han-Hans, or How-Hows, for the reason that they pronounce that
sound in loud tones during their ceremonial worship or when engaged
in battle. Some of the tribes killed or drove out their former pastors
and-Christian teachers, and all among them who refused to adopt the
new faith were relentlessly persecuted. 0n the other hand, many tribes
and individual Maoris remained friendly, and materially aided the Gov-
ernment in prosecuting the war.

"The Han--Hans were subtitled in 1866, and the murderers of Rev.
Mr. Volkner and other missionaries were captured and executed. Peace
came, but it was temporary; hostilities were soon resumed, but the

fighting that followad was not of a very serious character. Struggling
bands and isolated tribes continued to give trouble, and there was one
guerilla warrior, named Te Kooti, who was hunted for years without
success.

" The King of the Maoris lived among his own people, and made no
trouble as long as he was allowed to remain undisturbed. His territory
was known as the King Country, and no Englishman was allowed to
enter it except with a. special permission from the King or some other
Maori authority. Gradually his power melted away, and he is now a
very shadowy king indeed. Finding that war was not made upon them,
the natives became less and less exclusive regarding the King Country,
and in 1883 the chiefs consented to have their lands surveyed, with a
view to having the titles determined in the native land-courts. In 1884:
the Minister for Public Works passed right through the King Country
with the avowed object of selecting a suitable route for a railway; he
was not opposed in any manner, but, on the contrary, was respectfully
received by the chiefs. A law has been passed which reserves a large
area of land for the sole use of the natives, and from present appear-
ances there will be no further trouble with the Maoris.FROM TAURANGA T0 NAPIER. 241

"There you have the Maori war boiled down. It cost the Govern-
ment a. vast amount of money, caused the shedding of a great deal of
blood, led to bitter quarrels between the civil and military authorities,
and very often was a matter of much perplexity to the Home Govern-

ment of Great Britain; and practically it all came from the determina-
tion of two races of people, one native and the other foreign, to possess
the rich soil of New Zealand." -

From Tauranga, our friends went by steamer to Napier, touching on
the way at two or three ports of secondary importance. Napier is the
chief town in the provincial district of Hawke's Bay, and is prettily situ-
ated in a position that in some of its features reminded Fred and Frank

16
of Naples. The harbor is fairly good, but not as deep nor as well shel--
tered as that of Auckland. Important works are in progress for im-
proving the harbor, and one Of the leading citizens with whom our
friends conversed assured them that before their words were in print
Napier would be ready to accommodate the largest steamers in any of
the regular lines between New Zealand and Europe. ~

Fred learned on inquiry that Napier was the outlet of a large area
of grazing country, its exports consisting mainly of wool, frozen and
canned meats, hides, and other products of regions whose chief indus-
tries were the raising of cattle and sheep. His informant told him that
since the railway had reached the forest region they had done a fine
business in lumber, and expected the lumber-trade to increase year by
year. He further said that while Napier was an excellent place for a
man in good health it was attractive to invalids, owing to the mildness
of its climate. "It is," said he, "the resort of consumptive and asth-
matic patients from various parts of New Zealand, and in time we ex-
pect to have them come here from Australia and India. A sanatorium
has been established here in charge of our local medical men, and we
also," he added, " have a fine cemetery, where anybody who fails to be
cured can be sure of a comfortable and quiet place." After this, what
more could a. town claim in its behalf 2

Hotels, churches, public buildings, and all the paraphernalia of a

.as they rode or walked through the streets. Manufactories of various
kinds were busy, there was a goodly number of ships in port, and alto-
gether Napier had an attractive appearance. That it was in the region
of the Maoris was evident by the numbers of the natives on the streets,
though they did not seem to be busily employed. While looking at a
group of them engaged in rubbing noses with friends they had just met
--this is the Maori form of salutation--Frank asked a gentleman to
whom he had been introduced if the Maoris around Napier were as in--
dustrious as those of Auckland and its neighborhood.

" They are not," said the gentleman; "at least, such is my impres-
sion. The Maoris here were friendly during the war times, and con-
sequently were allowed to retain their lands, those of the hostile tribes
having been confiscated. There are about four thousand Maoris in
the Hawke's Bay district, and they own large tracts of fertile lands.
Some of them have farms which they cultivate, but the greater part
of them prefer to lease their lands to European settlers and live in
laziness on the rentals they receive. They are as a rule improvident,FARMING AND STOCK-RAISING NEAR NAPIER. 243

and show little desire to improve their condition, though the Govern-
ment maintains native schools among them at its own expense.

"This district," he continued, "is much more pastoral than agri-
cultural, and we think it is the best part of New Zealand for sheep and
cattle. I wish youcould be. here at the time of our annual fair, so
that you could see for yourself what we produce. The show of sheep
is excellent, and the 1nerinos,Lincolns, and Cotswolds exhibited cannot
be excelled anywhere in the whole colony. Our horses are certainly
good, and at the last show there was not an inferior animal in the
cattle-pens. One class of eight heifers was so good that the judges
commended all that did not take prizes. Then we had ploughs, horse-
rakes, grain-sewers, wagons, pleasure carriages, and other things, all
made in our own factories, together with jewellery and silver and gold
work from New Zealand metals, various manufactured articles, such as
farina, starch, glucose, and other products from the growth of our fields.

"And here," said the gentleman, as he took up a curious lump that
resembled a dried and shrivelled mushroom, "here is something that
will puzzle you."

The youths looked wonderingly at it, and confessed their ignorance
as to its character.

"I thought it would be new to you," their informant continued.
" It is a. fungus that grows in considerable quantities on the decaying

of a valuable (lye. The export of this fungus began about 1870 or '71;
in 1873 we sent about ten thousand dollars' worth of it to China, and
ten years later nearly ten times as much. There is an abundance of it,
and as fast as one crop is taken from a log a new one starts; so that
there seems to be no reasonable limit to the business which may grow
out of it."

Frank asked if the stuff was good to eat.

"I never heard of any one trying to eat it here," was the reply,u

"except a Chinaman. No European would venture to put it into his
mouth, but that's no reason why we shouldn't send it to China for con-
Slunption."

Doctor Bronson and his young friends remained a day at Napier,
and then proceeded by railway, coach, and railway again to Wellington,
the capital of the colony. Napier is distant from Auckland by sea.
about three hundred and seventy miles, and two hundred from Welling-
ton. The railway carried them southward to Tahoraiti, a distance of
eighty-three miles, where they took the coach for a ride of forty miles
to Mauriceville. There they found the railway to carry them to Wel-
lington, another ride of eighty-three miles. They were told that with-
in a year or two the gap would be completed, and the whole distance
between Napier and Wellington could then be made by train between
sunrise and sunset.

The first part of the ride was through a broken country, and the
flocks of sheep and herds of cattle scattered on the hills supported the
statement of their Napier acquaintance that the country was an excel-
lent one for grazing. After leaving the grazing country they entered
a forest region, where there seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of
lumber; and farther south they came to a comparatively level and open
territory, admirably suited to farms. The whole region was sparsely
settled, but is said to be rapidly filling up. Rabbits are numerous, and
our friends were told that the Government and settlers had expended
a great deal of money to get rid of them; but in spite of all efforts
they are on the increase, and have already rendered worthless large
areas of good pasture land.

We will have more to say of the rabbit pest in another place. For
the present we will land our travellers at Wellington, and send them to
one of its many hotels.

"YOU have only to look at the map to understand why the capital
was removed from Auckland to Wellington," said Doctor Bronson
to Frank and Fred as they were journeying towards the latter city.

"Yes," answered Frank, as he studied the map, "and see What a
fine harbor it has in addition to its position. Here it is at the head of
a bay which ought to be a shelter from all the storms that blow."

" It is the safest and most commodious harbor in New Zealand,"
remarked a gentleman who had joined them in conversation, while the
train was rolling through the forest and undulating land that lies to
the north of the city. "The bay is six miles long by the same in
width. It was originally named
Port Nicholson, and is still called
so on many of the maps. The
first settlement of the New Zea-
land Company was made here in
1839, a year before Captain Hob--
son started the government at
Auckland. You are probably
aware that the Government was
not friendly to the New Zealand
Company and its enterprises at
that time, and consequently Cap-
tain I-lobson, the first governor,
went elsewhere to establish his
authority and found his capital
city.

" Commercially, Wellington
has a good future before it, and
already it is in a condition of
prosperity. It has a population
of thirty thousand and more, the
country behind it is excellent for
farming and grazing, and our po-
sition on Cook Strait, which sep-- JUST news man we xsrsmon.
arates North and South Islands,
is the very best we could have. You will see for yourselves that we
have a good many industries, and nearly all of them are profitable ones."

In answer to a question by one of the youths, the gentleman enn-
merated tanneries, candle and soap factories, founderies, boot factories,
coach and carriage shops, breweries, planing and other mills; in fact,
all the establishments that might properly belong to a. growing city.
"Besides these," said he, "we have meatrpreserving works, and steamers
leave regularly, carrying our frozen and canned meats for consumption
in the Old World. We have several clubs, half a dozen banks, wharves
and dry docks for shipping, three daily papers, and several weeklies and
monthlies; and as for public institutions, in the way of hospitals, asy-
lums, and the like, you cannot name one that we are without".

In their walks and rides about Wellington our friends verified the
correctness of the foregoing statement in all its essential features.
They saw the factories, fouiidei-ies, shops, and other industrial establish-
ments the gentleman had mentioned; they called at one of the banks
to obtain money on their letters of credit; they visited one of the
newspaper ofiices, and saw the press turning out the huge sheets which
are the glory of Wellington and the admiration of all New Zealand--
except where personal or local preferences are otherwise--and the
Doctor was made at home at half the clubs before he had been six
hours in the place.

"It is an enterprising city," wrote Frank in his journal, after their
first round of sightseeing was ended. "It has a hospital with more
than a hundred beds, a lunatic asylum, and a prison, and according to
what we hear, all these institutions are well patronized. But what
most surprises us are the public buildings, which ought to be sufficient
for the wants of the city for many years to come. The Government
Building is an immense structure in the Italian style; it covers an area
of two acres, and is said to be the largest Wooden edifice in the world.
Then there are Government House, where the colonial governor lives
and exercises the duties of ruler of New Zealand; the Houses of Legis--
lature, which are lighted by electric light, the Provincial Buildings,
the Supreme Court Buildings, and the offices of the city and of the
provincial district. The telegraph and postal departments are in the
largest brick building in the colony; and as for churches, they are, as
the auctioneers say in their advertisements, ' too numerous to-mention.'

"We have the choice of twenty or more hotels, and if we should
want to go to the theatre we have three to choose from, though the
number is just now reduced to two, as one is closed for repairs. They
showed us the College, which has about one hundred and fifty students,
who come mostly from Wellington and its vicinity, though there are
representatives of every district in the colony. The streets are well
paved and lighted with gas; they have street railways by which you
can go quickly to all the principal suburbs; and if you prefer to ride
by yourself, there are as many cabs as you could Wish for.

" We have visited the colonial museum, Where we saw much to
interest us, particularly in regard to the Maoris. There is a fine collec249

tion of Maori weapons and articles of manufacture, and one might
almost make up a history. of this interesting people by studying the
Maori department of the museum. Of course they have a skeleton of
the gigantic Dinornis, or Moe, which we have already described; and
there is a beautiful display of the birds-of New Zealaud, which has
been arranged by a skilled or-
nithologist.

"From the museum we went
to the Botanical Gardens, which
cover an. area of perhaps a hun-
dred acres and are finely laid
out. They are a favorite resort
of the public, and here in the
early evening we had an oppor-
tunity to see of what a curious
mixture the population of a New
Zealand city is made up. There
were men and women from all
parts of the United Kingdom;
Yorkshiremen jostled against
Londoners, a Dubliner against a
representative of Glasgow, and
a Welshman against one who
first saw the- light at Dover
or Brighton. English, Scotch,
Irish, Catholic, Protestant, Gen-
tile, and Israelite all met har-
moniously, and if they brought

JUST ARRIVED man xsauxn. to this country any of their old
quarrels of race or religion they
forgot them all, at least while in the Gardens.

" But. if the assemblage at the Botanical Gardens was interesting, so
was the collection of trees and ferns. The Botanical Gardens are rich in
these things, and will be richer as the years go on. Not far from the
Gardens is a specimen of the New Zealand forest; we saw it at various
points along the railway, but did not try to walk through it, as we did
here. Unless a path is previously cut it is absolutely impervious, so
closely woven are the vines that interlace between the trees and climb
to their very tops.

"It is this impenetrability of the forest that gave the Maoris suchTHE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT. 251

an advantage during the war, as it was impossible for the English troops
to follow them half a dozen yards into the 'bnsh.' When Wellington
was first settled, and down to a few years ago, the hills around the
town were covered with this kind of forest. Most of it has been
cut down now, partly for the sake of the wood, and more particularly

~ for the purpose of clearing the
ground and making it available
for agriculture or building.

" As we are in the capital of
New Zealaud, this is a good place
to study the government of the
colony. . , ,

"Well, then, New Zealand is
an English colony, with a gov-
ernor appointed by the Queen,
and acting in accordance with
the principles of responsible gov-
ernment. Legislative power is
vested in the Governor and two
chambers. One of these cham--
bers is called the Legislative
Council, and consists of fifty-four
members nominated by the Gov-
ernor for life; the other is called
the House of Representatives,
elected by the people for. three
years, and consisting at present '
of ninety-four members.

"Down to 1876 each of the
nine provinces of the colony had
an elective superintendent and a
provincial council; in that year
the provincial form of govern- A ruonnsmnu.
ment was abolished, and the col-
ony was divided into counties and road-board districts, and the local
administration is now managed by the county councils and municipali-
ties. The colonial legislature meets once a year, and has power gener-
ally to make laws for the government of New Zealand. The acts of
the legislature may be disallowed by the Queen, and in some cases they
require her assent, but the royal prerogative is very rarely exercised.
" Voters must be twenty-one years of age, either born or naturalized
British subjects, and must have resided one year in the colony and six
months in the electoral district. Every male Maori of the same age whose
name is on a rate-payer's roll, or who has a freehold estate of the value

 

HOME 0? A PROSPZROUS REID"!-

of twenty-five pounds, may also be enrolled as a. voter. There are four
Maori members of the House of Representatives, elected under a special
law by the Maoris alone. Legislation concerning the sale and disposal
of the public lands and the occupation of the gold-fields is exclusively
vested in the colonial parliament. In general it may be said that the
parliament and the county and local boards have the management of
public affairs, just as the parliament. of England and the local authori-
ties there conduct the affairs of the nation at home.

"There is no connection between Church and State, otherwise than
in all ministers being registered once a year, in order that they maer
gally perform the marriage ceremony. At the last reports there were
638 registered ministers, belonging to the following denominations:
Church of England, 235; Presbyterian Church of New Zealand, 81;
Roman Catholic, 86; Presbyterian Church of Otago and Southland, 57;
Methodists, 95; Congregational Independent, 19; Baptist, 17 ; and tenSCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN NEW ZEALAND. 253

other bodies with from one to seventeen ministers each. The Episco--
palians of various kinds have over 200,000 adherents; the Presbyterians,
113,000; the Methodists, 50,000 ; and Catholics, 70,000.

" The whole country is divided into school districts for educational
purposes; the education is secular and free, the common branches being
taught on the same basis as in the schools of most of the United States.
There are high-schools and academies in the cities and larger towns;
there are colleges and universities in the principal cities, and there is
the University of New Zealand, which is an examining body only, and
has the power to confer the same degrees as the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge. All things considered, the educational system of the

 

SEWING-CLASS IN AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.

colony seems to be an excellent one, and the people deserve credit for

the attention they have given to it.
" We were invited to visit some of the schools in Auckland, and also

in Napier and Wellington, and while travelling through the country we
have had glimpses of some of the smaller schools. It was very much
like visiting similar establishments in New England or New York, the
branches of study as well as the form of instruction being practically
the same. They tell us there are more than eleven hundred schools of
all kinds in the colony, and nearly one hundred thousand scholars at-
tending them. Seventy-three per cent. of the male, and sixty-eight per
cent. of the female, population can read and write, and about five per '
cent. can read only. In the coming generation the proportion will
be much greater. '

"In another respect New Zealand resembles England in having an
enormous public debt in proportion to her population. According to the
published figures the debt amounts to PS35,000,000, or $175,000,000,
which is very nearly $350 for each inhabitant of the colony. The in-
terest charge on this debt is about $13 annually for each inhabitant, so
that the tax for this purpose alone is by no means light. And yet
the colony seems quite unconcerned about it, and the authorities gen-
erally seem to think that there will be no trouble whatever in paying
the interest promptly, and also in wiping out the principal in course
of time. A sinking fund has been established for the reduction of the
debt, and at the last report it exceeded $15,000,000.

"The money has been expended in various public works, especially
in the construction of railways, of which there are nearly two thousand
miles in both islands, South Island having the greater number. There
are a few private lines, principally for the use of coal-mining companies,
and not amounting in all to twenty miles; all the others are the prop-
erty of the Government, and are operated on its account. The profit
of operating the railways is about two per cent. of their cost; but the
lines are greatly benefiting the country in aiding its development, and
will doubtless pay much better before many years.

" There, I'm afraid I've given you a large doseof figures; but if you
don't like them you can skip. They were interesting to Fred and myu
self, and therefore I thought others might like to see them. Popula-
tion, railways, education, and public debt are interesting studies when
they concern a country which has been colonized only since 1840, and is
literally on the other side of the world from England and the United
States."

While Frank was occupied with the foregoing story Fred was mak-
ing further investigations about Wellington. One of his first queries
was about the use of wood in the construction of so many of the public
buildings, and nearly all the private residences..ZO--wure--n J<~o=ho Z<

mum: av nu cox-mos. wuunovoa.
He learned, in response to his interrogatories, that Wellington has
sufl'ered at different dates from earthquakes; and at one time they were
so severe and so numerous that it was thought it would be necessary to
abandon the site altogether. Buildings of wood endure earthquakes
much better than do those of stone or brick; and then, too, wood is a
cheaper material. All through New Zealand the proportion of wooden
buildings to stone, concrete, or brick is very large, and it is larger in
Wellington than in any other city.

Many of the buildings stand on ground reclaimed from the sea, and
the work of reclamation is still going on. High hills come down close
to the original shore, and while they are good enough as the sites of
residences, they are unsuited to the requirements of commerce, which
prefers level ground. Wellington is the centre of a considerable steam-
ship business; the lines from Sydney and'Melbourne centre there; .it is

- the port of the lines running between England and the colony, and all
the coasting lines include it in their itinerary.

A pressing invitation was given to our friends to visit New Plymouth,
the principal town of the provincial district of Taranaki north of the
provincial district of Wellington. They at first declined, but afterwards
accepted when they found that their time and engagements would per-
mit their doing so. The journey was by coach seventy miles to Foxton,
and thence by rail one hundred and ninety miles to New Plymouth.
A railway is in course of construction between Wellington and Foxton,
and is completed for a short distance from Wellington. The coach.
ride was more interesting than coach-rides usually are, and is thus
described by Fred:

"The weather was delightful, and we had seats on the outside of
the coach, so that our view of the scenery was unobstructed. For the
first few miles the road follows the shore of the bay; then it turns into
a pretty valley, which was once heavily wooded but is now cleared, and
no doubt deprived of much of its former beauty. We crossed the ridge
which separates the harbor of Wellington from the ocean on the west
coast, and after winding among a series of hills found ourselves rolling
along close to the shore of the ever restless Pacific--[NE No joke is
intended in the juxtaposition of the last three words of the foregoing
sentence]

"The villages we saw had native and foreign names strangely min-
gled. One village was Johnsonville, and the next was Porirua; one
was Horokiwi, and another close to it was Smithtown, or something of
the sort. We wound through the Horokiwi valley, ascending steadily,A COACH--RIDE ALONG run COAST. 257

and suddenly reached the summit of a bill, which gave us a magnificent
view. To the north was a great plain, which seemed almost as limitless
as the ocean that filled the western horizon, and lay far below us at the
base of an almost precipitous hill. Rising out of the sea was the island
of Kapiti, its summit nearly two thousand feet high, and forming a
striking feature in the picture before us.

"The driver called attention to something that resembled a white
cloud on the horizon to the north-west, and told us it was Mount
Egmont, nearly a hundred and fifty miles distant, and which we should
see very closely as we approached New Plymouth. We used our eyes
every minute of the time the horses were taking breath, and then
started down a steep hill-side
to the sea again.

" As soon as we reached the
sea we turned along the beach,
and followed it for forty miles '
till we drew up in Foxton. In y '
a year or two the railway from ;,
Wellington will be completed 5
to Palmerston, where it will
connect with the Foxton--New
Plymouth line; when this hap-
pens it is probable that the old
stage-road will be abandoned,
and travellers deprived of a
very interesting ride. .

" Foxton is a flourishing i
little place, with peihaps a news ms snort
thousand inhabitants, on the
bank of the Manawatu River, four miles from its mouth. We saw
numerous fields of flex in the vicinity, and were told that flax was an
important article of export. We had little time to look around, as our
coach connected with the train, and in less than half an hour we were
rolling up the valley of the Manawatu, which the railway follows for
some distance.

"Ten miles out of Foxton we entered the forest, or 'bush,' as they
call it here, though much of it has been cleared away. Lumber is an
important product; we saw a goodly number of saw-mills at work, and
met freighttrains laden with lumber on its way to the seaport. The
gentleman who accompanied us pointed out some villages which he said

were settled by Scandinavians, who had proved themselves the very best
of colonists.

"From bush to open country and from open country to bush our
train went on, stopping occasionally at stations with little villages V
grouped around them, but very often with no other buildings visible
than those belonging to the railway. Our host explained to us that theA RAILWAY THROUGH "THE BUSH." 259

railway was built to develop the country, and for the greater part of
the route it was in advance of civilization and settlement. '1 think,'
said he, 'you have built a great many miles of railway in the United
States in the same way, and in doing so your stations have been prac
tically in the wilderness until settlements sprang up around them.
Railways in New Zealand have done a great deal for the development
of the country, and will do a great deal more as time goes on. They
give the settlers the communication they want with the markets, and
without such communication they cannot get along.'
"The passengers that boarded or left the train at the stations were .

principally settlers on the agricultural lands, laborers on farms or in

saw-mills, woodehoppers going to their work or leaving it for a visit to
one of the towns, merchants and travelling agents of various kinds, and
occasional natives. The Maoris have not been slow to perceive the
advantages of the railway; at first they were disinclined to travel by it,
through fear of evil consequences; but their prejudice is steadily dimin-
ishing.

"Doctor Bronson says prejudice against railways is not confined
to savages, as he has known fairly intelligent men in New England
and other parts of the United States resolutely refuse to trust them-,
selves inside a railway-carriage under any circumstances. Our host
tells us that the Maoris were once under the impression that the Eng-
lishmen had a demon of some kind chained in the locomotive and com-
pelled to move it by turning a. crank. Their more intelligent men have
learned the power of steam and explained it as far as possible to the

. rest, so that the demon theory exists no longer.

" \Ve left behind us the provincial district of Wellington, and entered
that of Taranaki. The district takes its name from the Taranaki
mountain, which has been called Egmont by the English, and is so
known on the maps. Mount Egmont is a, cone eight thousand three
hundred feet high, and volcanic. We wanted to ascend it, but had not
the time to do so, and consoled ourselves with the reflection that we
were saved from a great deal of fatiguing work. It is no easy matter
to ascend this mountain; those who have undertaken it have never
shown any anxiety to repeat the journey. The mountain hes close to
the sea, as you will observe by a. glance at the map, and serves as a
magnificent landmark for sailors approaching this part of the coast.

"New Plymouth has a population of some four thousand or more,
and is the port of a section of country which is said to be very fertile,
as it can grow nearly every English fruit and cereal. It was settled
in 1841, but sufl'ered much during the Maori wars, as most of the
natives in the district of Taranaki were hostile. They showed us sev-
eral factories, saw-mills, and a large flouring-mill, and they called our
attention to an establishment for making iron from the sands of the
sea-shore.

" All along this coast of North Island there is a large quantity of
iron in the sand, sometimes as high as seventy per cent. The people
call it steel, but it is really iron; it is in fine particles, just like the iron-
sands of the southern shore of Long Island, near New York. They
said the iron-works at New Plymouth had never been prosperous, as
they could not get the proper flux for the metal; if they could only do'
this their success would be enormous. Doctor Bronson 'told them that
exactly the same thing had been tried near New York for utilizing the
black sand of Long Island, and thus far it had been a failure. The
large proportion of iron in the sand is noticeable, not only to the eye26]

but to the sense of touch; as you pick up a handful its unusual weight
at once calls attention to it.

"We visited a farm near New Plymouth, where we spent a night
and a day listening to stories of the troublous times of the Maori war,
riding or walking through finely tilled fields, and looking at herds of
cattle and flocks of sheep which were well calculated to excite the ad-
miration of all who are interested in grazing or agricultural pursuits.

" One gentleman whom we met was an old settler who had fought the
Maoris, and had twice seen his farm devastated and his fields ploughed
up to destroy the growing crops. On the road near his farm a party of
Europeans was waylaid and murdered one day by the Maoris, and it
was only an accident which prevented his being one of the party. As
long as the troubles with the Maoris continued the district of Taranaki
was in a precarious state, as the lands could not be occupied; but with
the establishment of peace there was every reason to believe their settle-
ment would be a matter of steady progress.

"We returned to New Plymouth in time to take the semi-weekly
coasting steamer for Wellington, where we stopped a few hours and
then continued across Cook Strait to Nelson and Picton, taking steamer
at the latter place for Port Lyttelton, on the east coast. The route is an

interesting one, as the steamer is for most of the time close to the coast, ' "

which is bold and rugged and contains many little bays that remind us
of the herds of Norway or the inlets on the coast of Newfoundland or
New Brunswick. ,

"Nelson is on a landlocked bay which is rather diflicult of entrance,
but forms a perfect anchorage fora ship that once gets inside. Picton
has a situation very much like that of Nelson, and each is the centre of '
a farming and sheep-raising region. They had a great deal of trouble
with the Mam-is in the war times, and one of the sights of Picton is a
hill a few miles from the town, which was the scene of the socalled
Wairau massacre. Thirteen settlers were killed there in a fight with
the natives, and after the afl'air was over nine other settlers who had
been taken prisoners were murdered in cold blood."

At Port Lyttelton our friends left the steamer and proceeded to
Christchurch, which is reached by a railway eight miles long, and large-
ly tunnelled through the hills, one tunnel being nearly two miles in
length. Before the days of the railway the means of communication
was along a wagon-road which was known as the Zigzag, and occa-
sionally at present the road is patronized by those who dislike railway
travel or seek the picturesque. Lyttelton has a. good harbor, which isA RELIGIOUS COLONY. 263

principally due to the expenditure of a large amount of money for the
construction of a. breakwater andother purposw, and the place is pict-
uresquely situated at the head of a bay.

Christchurch owes its existence to a. movement in England, near the
end of the first half of the century, for establishing a. thoroughly Eng-
lish colony in New Zealcnd. Its projectors proposed to retain every-
thing that was best in English life, government, habits, manners, and

above all the Church of England. The direction of the colony was to
be in the hands of the Canterbury Association at home, rather than in
the control of the Government, though there was no intention of taking
a position hostile to it.

One of the founders of the Canterbury colony had been instrumen-
tal in establishing a Scotch colony in another part of New Zealand, and
being Scotch, it was naturally Presbyterian. There is a. story about
him that he once projected an Anglo-Hebrew colony, where the He-
brews should govern themselves according to their own laws, and
have no Christians living among them. He proposed this to a wealthy
   

Israelite, and hoped the scheme
would be received favorably.
The gentleman listened patient-
ly to his proposition, and then
said, " I do not see how my peo-
ple can thrive in such a com:
munity; most of them live by
trade, and will want to be where
there's somebody to trade with."
The plan of the new colony was
rejected at once.
'IAR"I'~'W-T'"K 1" "WWW"- The British Government gave
the Canterbury scheme all the
privileges it desired, except that of perfect self-government, which, of
course, could not be permitted. Canterbury was established as a, province
of New Zeuland, with Christchurch as its capital, and altogether it has
been prosperous. Christchurch is quite English in appearance and sur-
roundings, and boasts a. cathedral (which is not yet finished); and it has
a fine array of public buildings, several churches of the Church of Eng-
land,and others of the Baptist, Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, andAN ENGLISH CITY AT THE ANTIPODES. 265

not been strictly carried out, but on the whole has been quite success.
ful. There is an excellent museum, which is especially rich in New
Zealand matters; and there are parks, gardens, cricket-grounds, and
other places of amusement and exercise. With its suburbs it has a
population of nearly thirty thousand, and therefore is entitled to digni-
fied respect as a city.

"It would not have been difficult for us to imagine ourselves in
England," said Frank in his journal, after describing their arrival at
Christchurch. " Here are English shade-trees along the streets, and in
the gardens and parks; the houses are English in their mode of construc-
tion and furnishing, and the little river that runs through the town is
called the Avon. There are tram-ways, or horse railways, along the
broad and well-made streets, the lawns are velvety with English grasses,
and along the banks of the winding river the weeping-willow droops
almost to the stu'face of the water.

"We have been riding in all directions and in the suburbs, and
everywhere we have seen signs of prosperity and comfort. As we
went out on the principal road we were very soon in the midst of some
fine farms, and were not at all surprised to learn that the country
around Christchurch is very fertile and well adapted to farming. The
fields have English grasses, and are surrounded by English hedges; and
many of the farms looked for all the world as though they had been
picked up in England and dropped down here. The city has its water-
ing-place at Sumner, nine miles away, and there the inhabitants go to
get rid of the summer's heat as New Yorkers go to Coney Island or
Long Branch.

" A. gentleman to whom we had letters of introduction invited us to
dine at his house the day we arrived, but an hour before the time for
us to start he came to the hotel and evidently had something serious
on his mind. After a few preliminary words he came straight to the
point, and said he was obliged to ask us to consider the engagement
' oli" for the present.

" " The fact is,' said he, 'my wife's cook has just left to get married,
and our other girl left last week, and we've not been able to fill her
place. There's nobody in the house to cook the dinner; my wife can
take care of the household, but we would hardly like to try to enter-
tain visitors under such circumstances.'

"Of course we excused him, and tried to make his mortification as
slight as possible. The incident led to a conversation about the ' serv-
ant question,' which has troublesome features in many other countries
as well as in New Zealand.

" The gentleman who wanted to be our host, but just then couldn't,
told us that there was a great scarcity of house-servants in the colony,
and he thought Christchurch was a little worse off than any other city,
though he was not at all sure about it. Very often it is impossible to
get maid-servants at any price, and those that can be obtained demand
high wages, and are independent to a degree that would not be tolerated
in England. A discharge has
no terrors for a cook or house-
maid who knows that a dozen
places are open to her; and
when she consents to take a.
place she can be sure of four
dollars a week and her board,
with at least two evenings out
in a week, and sometimes three.
Many of the well-to-do colonists
had tried the experiment of
importing maidservants from
England, but found the specu-
lation a bad one, as the girls
generally left service in a few
months to get married. Their
passage had been paid to New
Zealand, and with matrimony
in view, they laughed at any
idea of working out the time
for which they had agreed.

" He further told us that in

Mun-sunusr ovr Du'n'. many houses. the mistress was

obliged to do all her own work

with the aid of her daughters, if she had any; and this, too, where they
were perfectly willing and able to hire servants.

"Doctor Bronson told him the story of the man in San Francisco
who was trying to hire a maid-servant that declined the situation on
account of his three children. 'I will not go into a family where there

is more than one child,' was her ultimatum. Whereupon the gentle-
man said, 'We can easily fix that, I think.'
" ' How so ?' she asked._ ARTESIAN WELLS. 267

" ' I'll speak to my wife about it, and rather than lose the chance of
engaging 'you, I've no doubt she would be willing to drown two of
them.'

"Our New Zealand friend laughed heartily over the story, and
before he left us he had evidently forgotten his annoyance at the cir-
cumstance that brought him to the hotel. He added that the story
would not be inappropriate to Christchurch, but he feared all his neigh-
bors would not appreciate the joke.

"All along this part of the coast water is obtained by artesian wells
at about eighty feet from the surface. Christchurch has hundreds of
such wells, and the supply of water never fails; they reminded us
of the wells in the sands of Long Island, and along the Atlantic coast
of the United States all the way to Florida."

FFHE provincial district of Canterbury is both an agricultural and a
pastoral country, part of it being well adapted to grain-growing,
and the rest to grazing. Its staple productions are grain and wool, and
it ships large quantities of
'both to England and other
countries. There are more
than 5,000,000 sheep in the
district, besides 200,000 cat
tie and horses; the annual
product of wheat is nearly
7,000,000 bushels, and of
oats half that amount. Ev-
idently the Canterbury pil-
grims did not choose un-
wisely when they came here
to _found their Utopia.

Our friends were invited
to visit a sheep-station and
wheat-farm in the interior,
and at once accepted. Mr.
Abbott, the gentleman who
gave the invitation, ex-
mm um um" plained to them that the

plain of Canterbury, which extended to the foot of the outlying hills of
the Southern Alps, was principally devoted to agriculture, while the
hilly region was more adapted to sheep-raising. "We will go to the
sheepshearing region first," said he, "and on our return will have a
look at a wheat-faim. We will go by railway to Springfield, forty-six
miles, and from there the coach will carry us in a few hours to the sheep--
station that I wish you to see. Be ready for the train at eight o'clock
tomorrow morning."

The party was ready at the time appointed; in fact, it was ready
some minutes before the time, in accordance with the promptness which
characterized the movements of Doctor Bronson and his nephews.
They found the railwaystation large and commodious, and arranged
after the plan of an English station in a community of much greater
extent. "It was built for our future rather than for our present needs,"
said Mr. Abbott. "In time we hope to require all the space at our
command, but just at present there is sometimes a suggestion of lone-
liness about it." I

The country through which the train passed on its way to Spring-
field bore evidences of careful cultivation, and our friends found it
difficult to believe that previous .to 1850 this whole region was a wilder-
ness. Certainly the Canterbury pilgrims were not inclined to idleness,
and the condition of their fields indicated that they belonged to men
of industry and intelligence. As the train moved westward the mount
ains became more and more distinct, and long before Springfield was
reached they filled the whole of the western horizon with their tower-
ing peaks.

"We have an agricultural college at Lincoln," said Mr. Abbott,
"where our young men can learn practical and scientific agriculture
adapted to the colony. It is under the control of the Canterbury-
College Board of Governors, and has a farm of five hundred acres, and
comfortable buildings for the students. Agriculture is taught practi-
cally, and we have every reason to expect excellent results from the
college in the course of the next few years."

From Springfield a ride of a few hours carried the party to the sheep-
station, where they were warmly welcomed. The sun was just setting
when they arrived, and it was too late to examine the place and its sur-
roundings. A supper consisting of mutton in outlets and stew, accom-
panied by bread baked on hot stones, and- washed down with tea,
received careful and appreciative attention by the hungry travellers.
The sleeping accommodations were limited but comfortable, and in theRIDING OVER A SHEEP-RUN. 271

morning all were out in good season, and ready to consider the sheep-
raising question.

Horses were brought, and though somewhat unruly at first, they
proved very satisfactory to their riders; at any rate, nobody had any
bones broken in the forenoon's ride, though there were some narrow
escapes. Accompanied by their host, the party rode over the sheep-run
for several miles, visiting the borders in charge of their flocks, and

studying the peculiarities of the country. Frequently during their ride
Mr. Abbott drew rein and, called attention to the natural and other
advantages or disadvantages of the business, and showed them wherein
it differed from sheep-farming in America.

" Here, as everywhere else," said he, " we must make sure of a plen-
tiful supply of water if we want to prosper. Some of the streams run
dry at certain seasons of the year, and it is necessary that a man should
know before he locates if a stream can be relied upon throughout the
year. On some of our runs we have made trenches and brought water
for long distances, as it is cheaper to have the water run where we want
it than to drive the sheep several miles. There is an abundance of
water flowing from the mountains, but it is- not properly distributed by
nature; therefore we have called science to our aid, and extensive irri- -
gation-works have been made by the local and colonial governments,
and in this way thousands upon thousands of sheep-pasturing and agri-
cultural lands that were formerly almost worthless are now valuable.
You probably observed some of the irrigating-ditches as we were com-
ing along the railway.

"In the lower hills we do not suffer from snow--storms, but some of
the sheep-farmers who have established themselves high up'among the
mountains have lost heavily from this cause. Sometimes there will be
several years without a severe storm, and then will come one that kills
01? thousands and thousands of sheep in a very few days. This was the
case a few years ago, when the losses were very heavy; one flock of
more than a. thousand sheep was shut up in the mountains, and perished
with their herder, who was found (lead by their side. Other flocks
were buried and died in the snow, but the herders managed to save
themselves. _

"But the rabbits and parrots are our worst enemies, as you may
have heard." _

"Yes, I've heard so," replied Frank; "at least I've been told that
the rabbits have been terribly destructive of grass, and ruined many
thousand acres of pasturage." .

" Rabbits were first introduced," said Mr. Abbott," as a table luxury
and to furnish hunting sport; and besides, it was thought they would be
handsome ornaments on a place. But very soon it was found that they
were a great pest; they increase very rapidly, and as the country was
sparsely settled, the settlers were unable to keep them down. Men
were hired to trap, shoot, or capture them in some way, and were paid
at the rate of twopence for each rabbit-skin, but this plan was not
eifective, as it was not rapid enough, and after many experiments we
took to poisoning the creatures by wholesale. " '

"How did you do it. 9"

"By means of grain saturated with phosphbrusswe prepare bar-
rels with closely fitting lids, and fill them half full with oats; then we
pour boiling water on the oats, and when they are thoroughly soaked
and swollen we pour in a quantity of phosphorus, quickly replacingHOW RABBITS ARE SLAUGHTERED. 273

the oover, so that the poisonous fumes cannot escape. This grain scat
tered over the ground is death to the rabbits, but the disadvantages of
the plan are that sheep are often killed by the poisoned grain.

" To give you an idea. of the slaughter of rabbits in New Zealand;
let me say that ten millions of rabbitskins are exported every year, but
the value of these skins is very little 'compared with the damage which

 

SHKBP AND HERDBR KILLED IN A SNO'V-mn".

the animals have caused. The latest official reports show that the nui-

sauce is checked in some localities, but there are yet many millions of -

rabbits to be disposed of. In England and other countries foxes, wolves,

weasels, and other noxious animals keep down the number of rabbits;
18
but here, where they have no natural enemies, the country suffers terri-
bly. Many a. sheep-farmer has been ruined by the total destruction of
his pasturage, and the loss to the colony may be reckoned by millions
of dollars.

 

REDUCING flu! RABBIT POPULATION.

" Australia and Tasmania are equally afflicted by rabbits," the gen-
tleman continued, "which were introduced into those countries from
New Zealand for the same reasons that they were introduced here.
Millions of pounds sterling would not compensate for their ravages, and
the public and private expenditure for their destruction has already
mounted into those figures. Dogs, ferrets, poison, trapping, drowning,
and every other known means have been tried to reduce them, but with-
out success. Occasionally the whole population turns out for a. rabbit
'battue,' in which many thousands of the animals are killed. The own-
ers of sheep and cattle runs have built hundreds of miles of rabbit-
fences, and the colonial governments have done likewise; the fences
stop the progress of the vermin for a time, but after a while they man-
age to burrow beneath them and come up on the other side, and so
the fences are not effective to prevent the spread of the pest."A CHANCE FOR A FORTUNE. 275

"Haven't I read about their being killed by forcing noxious gases
into their warrens ?" one of the boys asked.

"Yes," was the reply, "that has been done, but the machines for
making and using the gas are costly and cumbersome, and in rocky
regions they do not work satisfactorily.

"Recently the Government of New South Wales has offered a re-
ward of twenty-five thousand pounds to any one who will devise a. suc-
cessful system of destroying rabbits, provided it is not dangerous to
live-stock and to human beings. The attention of the scientific world
is directed to the subject, and perhaps the remedy may be found. Pas-
teur, the celebrated French scientist, has proposed to inoculate a few
rabbits with chickencholera and allow them to run among their kin-
dred, and thus introduce the disease. He says it is harmless to all ani-
mals, with the exception of rabbits and chickens, and believes that the
whole rabbit population could in this way he killed 01f, though at the
same 'time our domestic fowls would be killed too, unless they were
carefully shut up. We could afford to lose every fowl in the southern
hemisphere if we could only get rid of this great pest of rabbits; but it
will be necessary to proceed very cautiously, lest our sheep and cattle
should suffer."

The youths had a realizing sense of the extent of this pest in the
Australasian colonies, when they saw on several occasions whole hill-
sides and stretches of plain that seemed to be in motion, so thickly was
the ground covered with rabbits. Mr. Abbott further told them that
Dunedin and other cities had a regular exchange, or market, for rabbit-
skins, where dealings were conducted as in the grain, wool, and other
exchanges. The skins mostly find their way to London, Paris, Berlin,
Vienna, and Naples, where they are made into "kid" gloves of the
lower grades. They are also made into hats, and it is hoped that they
may be found useful for other purposes, so as to make profitable the
wholesale slaughter of the animals on whose backs they grow.*

 

* A recent writer on this subject says: "On the arid, barren Riverina plains (where-
on naturally not even a mouse could exist) there are pastured at present some twenty or
twenty-five millions of high-class merino sheep. These sheep are being gradually eaten
out by rabbits. The following will serve as an illustration, nnd it must be borne in mind
that it is only one of many which could bendduccd.

"On the south bank of the river Murray. consequently in the colony of Victoria,
there is a station named Kulkyne, which has about twenty miles frontage to that river.
The holding extends far back into arid. naturally worthless. waterless country. On that
station. by skilful management and by command of capital, there came to be pnstured
on it about 110.000 sheep. When I two or three years ago visited that station I found
" How about the parrots t" Fred asked, when the rabbit question was
disposed of.

"That is a strange piece of history," replied Mr. Abbott. "When
the sheepfarmers first established their stations among the mountains
there were flocks of the Iced, or green parrot, living in the glens and
feeding entirely on fruit and leaves. They were beautiful birds, and
nobody suspected any harm from them.

"After a time it was observed that many of the sheep, and they
were invariably the finest and fattest of the flocks, had sores on their
backs, and always in the same place, just over. the kidneys. Some of
the sores were so slight that the animals recovered, but the most of
them died or had to be killed to end their sufferings.

" The cause of these sores was for some time a mystery, but at length
a herdsmen on one of the high ranges declared his belief that the green
parrots were the murderers of the sheep. He was ridiculed and laughed
at, but was soon proved to be right, as a parrot was seen perched on
the hack of a fat sheep and tearing away the flesh.

"Investigation showed that in the severe winters the parrots had
come at night to the gallows, where the herdsmen hung the carcasses
of slaughtered sheep. They picked off the fat from the mutton, and
showed a partiality for that around the kidneys; how they ever eon-
neeted the carcasses with the living sheep is a subject for the naturalists
to puzzle over, and especially how they knew the exact location of the
spot where the choicest fat was found in the living animal. It seems
that the attacks on the sheep beganwithin a few months after the par-
rots had first tested mutton at the meat-gallows."

"Have they done much damage i" one of the youths asked.

" Yes, a great deal," was the reply; " but not so much of late years,
as they are being exterminated, One man lost nineteen fine imported
sheep out of a. flock of twenty, killed by the parrots; and another lost
in the same way two hundred in a flock of three hundred. Every flock
in the mountains suffers some from this cause, probably not less than
two per cent. a

fully concealed in the daytime, and only
venture out at night. Their dep'reda,
tions have always been made in the
night, and hence it was some time be-
fore the cause of the wounds on the
sheep was known."

Frank and Fred asked about the
profits of the sheepraising business, but the
information they obtained did not encourage
them to become sheepfarmers in New Zealand. - - v .
What with the rabbits and the parrots, with dis- "HMS.
eases among sheep, fluctuations in wool, the high
price of labor, especially at shearing-time, when extra men
must be engaged, with a full knowledge of their importance,
the profits are not what they were in the early days of the
industry.

From the sheep-station they returned to Springfield, and took \
train again in the direction of Christchurch. At the scoond or
third station from Springfield they were met by a carriage, which took
them to the wheatfarm, which was "one of the objects of the journey.
Time did not permit a lengthened stay here, but it was sufficient to
enable them to see a good deal before their departure. -

Here is a summary of what they learned about wheat farming in
New Zealand:

" About four hundred thousand acres of ground are utilized for wheat
in the different counties of the colony. The farmers expect twenty- -five
bushels to the acre in most localities,
but frequently this figure' is exceeded,
the average throughout the country
for one year being in excess of twenty-
six bushels. Consequently, the wheat
crop may be set down at ten million
bushels, of which by far the greater

A New zmuxn m1. portion is available for exportation."

Frank made a note here to-the

eflect that half a million acres of land were devoted to raising oats, at
an average of thirty-five bushels to the acre. Barley, hay, potatoes, and
other things brought the amount of land under crop up to a million
and a half acres, while there were five and a half million acres under
grasses, including grass-sown land that had not been previously ploughed.
The figures, were about evenly divided between the two islands. The
colony contains about fourteen million sheep, seven hundred thousand
cattle, and one hundred and sixty thousand horses.

"Of late years the export of wheat has fallen off, owing to the com-
petition of India and America in the markets of Europe; the wheat-
farms of New Zealand are so unprofitable that the owners talk of put-
ting much of their ground into grass, though they will continue the
cultivation in order to supply enough for home consumption and to
employ the machinery they have on hand.

 

A STKAH TllRfiIHNGAHACIHNE.

" The open country of South Island is admirably adapted for wheat,
and the soil is so easy to manipulate that double-furrow ploughs are
used. The large farms are provided with all the latest improvements
in machinery and implements; and we found the intelligent farmers
thoroughly familiar with American reapers and mowersysteam thresh-
ing-machines, steam wagons, and other things, so that we felt quite atWl-IEAT--FARMS AND DAIRY--FARMS. 279

home. They asked us about the wheat-farms of America, and were
inclined to shake their heads when we told them of fields so large that
a plough could only turn a single furrow around one of them in a day's
time.

" 'Do you really mean it?' said one of them, with an emphasis of
surprise.

"Doctor Bronson assured them of the correctness of the statement,
and added that on the Dalrymple farm in Dakota, or rather on one of
the Dalrymple farms, there was a single field of thirteen thousand acres.
' That makes,' said he, ' about twenty square miles, and I doubt if you
have any team that could plough more than one furrow around such a
field in a day.'

" They acknowledged that such was the ease, and though they had
fields containing hundreds of acres inside a single fence, they had noth-
ing that approached the wheat-fields of Dakota. We were sorry after-
wards that we mentioned our enormous wheatrfields, as we thought it
set them to thinking of American competition, and the efl'ect' it might
have on their own business in future; but of course we couldn't resist
our national tendency to ' bmg' a little.

" Afterwards, when we were visiting a dairy-farm, a matter-of-fnct
Scotchman who owned the place remarked that he presumed we had
much larger dairy-farms in America, as he had heard of one where
they had a saw-mill which was propelled by the whey that ran from
the cheese-presses, and also a gristmill operated by buttermilk! ' '

" In the wheat-growing belt of South Island there is a scarcity of
timber, the forests being mainly in the hilly and mountain region.
The scarcity of timber has led to the planting of forests. Considerable
attention is given to this both by the authorities and by individuals,
and good results are predicted at no distant day. There is also a
scarcity of water, and to meet it irrigation-works have been constructed,
as already stated.

"Wheat-farmers are troubled by rabbits, and also by sparrows,
which were introduced to kill off caterpillars and other insect pests.
The sparrows increased in numbers almost as rapidly as the rabbits;
they changed their habits, and from carnivorous taste turned to eating
fruits and grains. The'New Zealand sparrow shuns the caterpillars
and worms he was imported to devour, and feeds on the products of
the garden and the field. The same is the case in Australia, where the
sparrows are now in countless millions, the descendants of fifty birds
that were imported about 1860. The colonial governments have offered
rewards for the heads and eggs of the sparrows, and though this has
caused an extensive destruction it has not perceptibly diminished their

numbers.

' "In an ofiicial investigation of
the 'sparrow pest,' one man testi-
fled that he sowed lns peas three
times, and each time the spar-
rows devoured them. . Another
told how the birds destroyed a
ton and a half of grapes, in fact
cleared his vineyard, and others '
said they had been robbed of all
the fruit in their gardens."

This is a good place to say
something about the exotics that
have been introduced into the
Australasian colonies. Cattle,
horses, sheep, and swine have

' been of unequivocal benefit, and
so has been the stocking of the
rivers with trout, carp, and other
food fishes of Europe. Larks and
a few other song-birds have thus
far proved of no trouble, but even
they may yet give cause to regret
their introduction. In addition to
the animal pests already men-
tioned, the Indian mina, or mino--
bird, a member of the starling fam-
ily, has become a great nuisance,
almost equal to the sparrow.

We will now turn from the animal to the vegetable exotics.
Wheat, oats, and the other grains are of course in the same beneficial

category as the domestic animals.

The innocent water-cress, which is

such a welcome addition to the breakfast and dinner table, has grown
with such luxuriance as to choke the rivers, impede the navigation of
those formerly navigable, and cause disastrous floods which have re-
sulted in loss of life and immense destruction of property. In the Otago
and Canterbury districts of New Zealand, the Government makes a large
expenditure every year to check the growth of this vegetable pest.VEGETABLE PES'l'S IN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA. 281

The daisy was introduced to give the British settler a reminder of
home, and already it has become so wide-spread as to root out valuable
grasses. Years ago an enthusiastic Scotchman brought a thistle to
Melbourne, and half the Scotchmen in the colony went there to see it.
A grand dinner was given in honor of this thistle, and on the following
day it was planted with much ceremony in the Public Garden of Mel-
bourne. From that thistle and its immediate descendants the down
was carried by.the winds all over Victoria, and many thousands of
acres of once excellent fields are now covered with tall purple thistles
to the exclusion of everything else. Large amounts of money have
been expended in the effort to eradicate the thistle, but all in vain.

The common sweetbrier is another vegetable exotic that has be-
come a pest. It was introduced for the sake of its perfume, but has
become strong and tenacious, spreading with great rapidity, and forni-
ing a dense scrub that utterly ruins pasture-lands. Money has been
expended for its destruction, but it refuses to be destroyed.

The English sparrow is the subject of much discussion in the United
States, and the opinion seems' to be gaining ground that he is- a pest
to be put out of the way if possible. Those who are inclined to advo-
cate his continued presence under the Stars and Stripes would do well
to study his history in the Australasian colonies, where the damage he
has caused is practically incalculable.

Our friends returned to Christchurch, and after another day in that
city proceeded by railway in the direction of the South Pole. At
the earnest solicitation of one of their acquaintances, they stopped a
few hours atBurnham, eighteen miles from Christchurch and on the
line of railway, to visit the industrial school for children whose par-
ents have neglected to care for them properly._ The object is to in-
struct the children in useful trades and occupations which can afford
them an honorable support in later years. The school has extensive
buildings and grounds, and has constantly about three hundred chil-
dren under instruction. Nearly all the ordinary trades are taught there,
and the manager said the children generally showed great proficiency
in learning what was set for them to do. -

" The main line of railway to Dunedin," wrote Frank in his journal,
"has several branches which serve as feeders by developing the coun-
try through which they pass. Portions of the line are through rolling
or hilly country, and there are other portions which stretch across
plains resembling the prairies of the western United States. On the
western horizon rises the line of snow-clad mountains, again reminding
us of railway travelling ove1 our own plains as we approach the range
of The Rockies '

, "We crossed several fine bridges spanning the rivers Rakaia, Ash-
burton, Rangitoto, and Waitaki; these rivers flow through wide beds,
and though ordinarily of no great volume become tremendous torrents
in seasons of floods. In the early days many a traveller came to his
death while seeking to ford one of these treacherous streams, and many
sad memories are connected with their l11st01 y

Mount Cook, the highest mountain of New Zealand, was pointed out to

us. It is 12,349 feet high, and its top is covered with perpetual snow;
it is the highest peak of the Southern Alps, which stretch along the west
coast of New Zealand for nearly two hundred miles, very much as the
Andes lie along the west coast of South America. Fred and I thought
we would like to climb Mount Cook, and spoke to Doctor Bronson
about it. The Doctor dampened our enthusiasm by saying that it was
more difficult of ascent than Mont Blanc, and he was unaware that the
feat had been accomplished since Rev. W. S. Green and two Swiss com-
panions reached the top of the mountain in 1883.

"He added that Mr. Green was a member of the famous Alpine

Club, and had brought the two Swiss mountain-climbers to assist him
in making the ascent. They made several attempts before they suc-
ceeded, and when they finally reached the summit it was after several
narrow escapes from death. They passed one night standing on a nar-
10w ledge of rock, whe1e a single misstep would have hu1led them to
instant death thousands of feet below. Frequently they toiled PS01 hours
up the side of a. spul of the mountain, and then found that theil labo1
\\ as lost, as further ascent was impossible, owing orto the steepness of the
rock."

"They had all the variety of adventures recorded in the history of
Alpine climbing," said a gentleman who was in conversation with Doc-
tor Bronson at the time the query was propounded, "except that of
being swept into crevasses or down the slope of the mountain and los-
ing their lives. Mr. Green has published a book, entitled 'The High
Alps of New Zealand,' in which you will find a description of the ascent
of Mount Cook. After you have read it I don't think you'll want to
follow the example of that gentleman, unless you have more than the
ordinary enthusiasm about mountain-climbing. "

" As we looked at the peak of Mount Cook rising sharply into the
sky," Frank continued, "we concluded that a view of the mountain
from below would satisfy all our desires. The gentleman roused our
curiosity, however, when he told us about the wonderful glaciers that
lie on the lower slopes of the great mountain, some of them larger than
any of the glaciers of Switzerland. Then on the way he pointed out
several lakesthat are fed by the glaciers on Mount Cook and other
peaks of the Southern Alps just as the lakes of Switzerland and Italy are
fed by the glaciers from the' Alps of Europe. Some of these lakes are
forty or fifty miles long, and of almost unknown depth; indeed, some of
them are deeper than the level of the ocean, though their bottoms have
been filling up for ages with the debris brought down by the glaciers.

"Look on the map and find Lake Tekapo; it is fifteen miles long
and three wide, and is supplied by the great Godley glacier, which lies
just above it. The Tasman glacier, eighteen miles long, is the largest
in New Zealand, though this statement is disputed by seine authorities.
At any rate, there are a great many glaciers, and all have not been fully
explored. They are on the western as well as on the eastern slope of

which comes down far below the snow-level, and is bordered with pine
forests and almost by cornfields.

"Some of the moraines, or channels, cut by the glaciers are very
deep, and most of the lakes lie in what Were moraines ages and ages
ago, when the ice extended much farther than it does now. Lake Pu-
kaki is a fine example of this; it is shut in by an old terminal moraine
which attains a height of one hundred and eighty-six feet above the
surface of the lake. On the western side of the Alps there are deep
channels which are called 'sounds,' and greatly resemble the flords of
Norway. Some of them are eighteen or twenty miles long, and vary
from half a mile to two or three miles in width; their sides rise almost
perpendicularly, sometimes for hundreds of feet, and they are nearly all
too deep to permit ships to anchor. Sounding-lines a thousand feet
long often fail to find bottom
there. Perhaps they are called
sounds because they can't be
sounded. '

" These sounds are sup-
posed to be ancient moraines,
and during the ice period of
the-world they were the beds
of glaciers coming from im--
mense lakes, encircling the
bases of the mountains and
covering areas of thousands of
miles. Altogether the scen-
ery of the Southern Alps is
said to be magnificent."

Dunedin has the reputation of being the largest, best built, and most
important commercial city of New Zeelend; it is the capital of the
provincial district of Otago, and the commercial centre of a large area of
country. The settlement of Otago was projected in 1846, and it was
intended to be exclusively occupied by adherents of the Free Kirk ofDUNEDIN AND rrs 'PECULIARITIES. 287:

Scotland, just as Canterbury at a, later date was to be the monopoly of
adherents. of the Church of England. The colony was not especially
prosperous under its exclusive system, though the thrifty settlers had
not much to complain of except the scarcity of neighbors.

But gold changed the Whole scene, and broke down the barrier
which the projectors of the colony had erected. In 1861 rich gold-
(liggings were discovered about seventy miles from Dunedin; diggers
flocked in from Australia and from other parts of the world, and from
the beginning of the gold rush Dunedin dates its prosperity.

It has all the characteristics of a thriving city; gas, paved streets,
horse-railways, race-course, theatres, schools, academies, churches, col-
leges, parks, gardens, museum, manufactories, and numerous other urban
things and institutions, all are to be found here. There are three daily
papers published in Dunedin, and a. score of weeklies and monthlies,

and there is an excellent library, supported partly by the municipal
authorities, and partly by contributions of enterprising citizens. With
its immediate suburbs it has a population of fifty thousand, and is stead-
ily increasing year by year. Its Scotch origin is apparent in the faces
and accent of the great majority of the residents, and by the statue of
the Scottish poet, Burns, which stands protected by a railing in front of
the town-hall. Most of the streets are named after those of Edin-
burgh and Glasgow.
 

HYDRAULIC MINING.

Our friends spent two days at Dunedin, and so attentive were the
gentlemen to whom they brought introductions that there were very
few leisure moments. Drives in the city and the suburbs, visits to the
manufactories =of various kinds, the public buildings, and the harbor,
luncheons and dinners at the houses of their friends, kept them as busy
as bees. They had hardly a minute to themselves, until they finally
shook the dust of Dunedin from their feet, and departed with their
faces once more towards the South Pole. Frank and Fred declared
that their journals were so far behind that it would be difficult for them
to catch up, and they had not taken nearly as many notes of what they
saw and heard 1n Dunedin as they desired.

" I wanted," said Frank, "to make a note of the things they manu-
facture in Otago, and especially at Dunedin, but the list was so long
and time so scarce that I didn't try , but I'll remark particularly that
they manufacture a good deal of woollen cloth, leather, cotton, and other
fabrics, which is something very unusual for so young a colony. There
is more manufacturing here than in any other part of New Zealand, and
the Scotch settlers of Otago seem to have brought here the thrift and .
industry for which their native land is celebrated."

Doctor Bronson asked Fred if he had learned anything about the
product of gold in Otago.GOLD--MINING 1N OTAGO. 239

" I have the figures right here," was the reply. " From 1861, when
the first discoveries were made, down to the end of March, 1884, the
Otago gold-fields produced 4,319,544 ounces, which were valued at
PS17,026,320, or about $85,000,000. Most of the gold has been obtained
from alluvial washings of various kinds, such as sluioing, tunnelling, and
hydraulic washing; auriferous reefs have been successfully worked in
several instances, and unsuccessfully in more. Gold-mining has become
a regular industry of the country, and is less subject to fluctuations than
in former times. Once in a while a. new field is opened, and there is a
rush to work it; but the excitement over such discoveries is not like
that of the five or ten years following 1861.

"Coal-mining is also an important industry of Otago," continued .
Fred. "Where formerly a great deal of coal was imported, the impor-

 

A somnsn's noun.

tation has dwindled to nothing, and for several years New Zealand has

not only produced its own coal, but has a surplus for export. At least

that is what one authority says; another says that the exportation con-

sists of coal sent to Australia for gas-making, and that the quantity
19 '
imported for uses to which New Zealand coal is not adapted exceeds
the export by nearly fifty thousand tons."

From Dunedin our friends proceeded by rail again to Invercargill,
139 miles from Dunedin, or 369 from Christchurch. Invercargill is a
prosperous town of some eight or
ten thousand inhabitants, and is near-
the southern end of South Island, a
sort of jumping-off place, as Frank
called it while looking at its location
on the map. The real terminus of
the island, though not its most south--
erly point, is The Bluffs, about seven--
teen miles below Invercargill, which
stands on an estuary called New Riv--
er Harbor.

The morning after their arrival
the travelling trio took the train for
Kingston, eightyseven miles, at the
southern end of Lake Wakatipu.
The train carried them through a
fine country of broad plains dotted
here and there with tracts of forest.
The region appeared to be well set--
tled, as there were little villages scat-
tered at irregular intervals, fields and
pastures surrounded by fences, herds
of cattle and flocks of sheep, isolated
farms, saw-mills, and other evidences of settlement and prosperity. Sev--
eral branch railways diverge from the main line and open up agricult-
ural, pastoral, mining, lumber, and other districts of much present or
prospective value.

" As we approached the lake," said Frank in his journal, " the coun-
try became more mountainous and picturesque. The train wound
through a long defile, and then came out upon the ' Five Rivers Plains,'
which take their name from five streams of water that pass through
them. We passed through the Dome Gorge, and at Athol, sixty-nine
miles from Invercargill, the conductor told us we were in the lake
country. The hills and mountains were everywhere about us, and in
,the west the great range of the Alps rose into the sky. At Kingston
the railway ends, and we stepped on board the steamboat, which carried

us the whole length of the lake. The lake is sixty miles long, and
reminded us of Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

"We spent the night at Queeustown, a mining and agricultural
town about twenty miles from Kingston, and on the next day com-
pleted our journey to the head of the lake. The scenery is magnificent,
and I can no more describe it adequately in words than I can tell 110w
a nightingale sings or a mangosteen tastes. All around us are the
mountains, the highest peaks covered with perpetual snow that seems
to flash back the rays of the sun, before whose heat it refuses to melt.
In the distance, higher than all the rest, is Mount Earnslaw; we saw it
clearly defined against the sky, but it is very often veiled by the fleecy
clouds that sweep around it.

"I am not surprised that the mountains of New Zealand have been
called the Southern Alps, for they certainly bear a close resemblance to
the Alpine chain of Switzerland; but I do not think any single peaks

 

SHMOVRR GORGZ BRIDGE.

are equal to the Matterhorn or the Jungfrau, though Mount Earnslaw
can well be called the peer of Mont Blanc. On the whole, the scenery
of the lake is not surpassed by that of any one of the Swiss lakes; and
when New Zealand becomes the regular field for tourists there will be
a good deal of travel to Lake Wakatipu. Most of the residents shorten
the name of the lake to Wakatip.
" We were urged to stop at Queenstown and see the mining opera
tions in the neighborhood, but time did not permit us to do so, and we
returned to Invercargill as quickly as the railway and steamboat could
carry us. Queenstown is one of the mining centres of the Otago gold-
fields, which we have already mentioned, and has had the usual ups and
downs of mining life. The Otago mines cover a. wide extent of coun-
try, and as much of the region in which they lie is agricultural, living is
cheaper here than in most other mining regions.

" A good many Chinese are engaged in mining in the New Zealand
gold-fields, and we were told that in one place--Orepuki--there was a
mining population of four hundred Chinese that subscribed PS100 ($500)
towards building a Presbyterian church, the total cost being less than A
a thousand dollars. And yet I presume there are white men in Ore-
puki who would call one of their Mongolian neighbors a ' heathen Chi-
nee 1' Near Dunedin and other places, as well as in the neighborhood
of most of the Australian cities, the market-gardening is largely man-
aged by the Chinese. They seem to have almost a monopoly of this
business, and we were told that no European could successfully compete
with them when they went at it in earnest."

were fortunate in finding at The Blufl's a. steamer which was going di-
rect to Sydney, and in less than six hours after their return from Lake
Wakatipu they were afloat and away for their destination, about four--
teen hundred miles distant. Six dnys later the coast of New South
Wales was in sight, and they entered the Australian continent through
the famous Sydney Heads.

All the way across from New Zealaud they had been listening to
the praises of the beauty and advantages of Sydney Harbor, which were
sounded by some of their fellow-passengers who lived in the capital of
New South Wales. " I doubt if you ever saw anything that approaches
it," said one; "not even the famous Bays of Lisbon, Rio J aneiro, and
New York can compare with it--so everybody says who has seen them
all. The navies of all the world could anchor there, and I wish they would
come some time in a peaceful way and do so. It would bring a lot of
business to Sydney, and send up the price of naval stores and supplies."
This blending of the practical with the boastful and poetical did not
fail to amuse the listeners. It was overheard by a Melbourne man,
who remarked that it was no more than you could expect of those fel-
lows in Sydney, who were always'on the lookout for something to bol-
ster up the decaying village they lived in.

Frank and Fred agreed that the Sydney advocate, whatever might
be his practical view of the anchorage of the navies of the world, was
justified in his praise of the beauty of Port Jackson, while his claims as
to its harbor facilities were not overdrawn. Certainly if there is any
harbor in the world where the navies of the world might anchor, it is
the one at Sydney; the entrance between the Heads is a mile wide,
and vessels drawing'twenty-seven feet of water can come in at any
time. The bay extends inland about twenty miles, and is completely

landlocked; there is deep water in most parts of it, and in many places
shipscan lie quite close to the shore. The shores are generally bold
and rocky, and some of the cliffs rise to a height of two hundred feet
and more. The borders of the bay consist of a. great many promon-
tories jutting into it, and the spaces between these promontories form
little bays or harbors by themselves. Islands in the bay add to its
beauty, and it is no wonder that Frank and Fred were more than ordi-
narily enthusiastic over the harbor of Sydney.
The city stands on Sydney Cove, one of the numberless bays or har~
bors of Port Jackson, about four miles from the entrance from the
ocean. We will further remark that fortifications have been erected
at the Heads, and the authorities are confident that a hostile fleet or
army coming to attack them could be successfully resisted. Doctor
Bronson told the youths that the harbor which resembled Port Jackson
more nearly than any other of which he knew, was Avatcha Bay, in
Kamchatka. "It has," said he, " several little bays or harbors around it,
just as Port Jackson has, and is fully as capacious and easy of access.
I wish we had a. diagram of it to show to our Australian friends."

"Before we left New Zealand," said Frank in his journal, " Doctor
Bronson telegraphed to an old friend, Mr. Donald Manson, telling him
by what steamer we expected to arrive. Mr. Manson was at the dock
to meet us; he had secured rooms for us at the best hotel, and under
his care we saw everything that was worth seeing in-Sydney. Later,
in Melbourne, where he was equally well acquainted, he was similarly
attentive, and we hereby record our unanimous vote of thanks to him
for his unvarying and unwearying politeness. If we tried his patience
at any time he never allowed us to know it, and we found him a perfect
encyclopsedia in everything relating to Australia, where he has been
a. resident for a goodly number of years.

" One day when a proposition was made to go on a hunting excur-
sion, Fred innocently suggested that he had read about Sydney ducks,
and would like to shoot some, provided, of course, they were in season.
Mr. Manson suppressed a smile as he answered that the shooting of
those peculiar birds was no longer practised; he then explained that
Sydney ducks can hardly be said to exist at present, the term having
been applied to runaway convicts. ticket-of-leave men, and other waifs
and strays, of the time when Australia was the receptacle of transport-
ed criminals from England and the other British Isles.

" Sydney seems to have been founded by or for these unfortunates.
Mr. Manson told us that the settlement was made here in January,
1788, by Captain Phillip, who came here with a fleet of store and trans-
port ships, for the purpose of founding a convict establishment. He
had previously landed in Botany Bay, but finding it unsuitable, had
abandoned it for the future site of Sydney. The name of the place
was given in honor of Viscount Sydney, who first suggested the coloni-
zation of New South Wales, and the bay was called Port Jackson, after

Sir George Jackson, who was then Secretary to the Lords of the Ad-
miralty.AN APPROPRIATE MEMORIAL. 297

"As soon as we had settled ourselves at the hotel, Mr. Manson
accompanied us in a. stroll and ride through the principal streets.
'Great changes have taken place here in the past twenty or even
ten years,' said Mr. Manson, as he called our attention to new and
magnificent buildings, which he said occupied the sites of wretched

structures that had only recently given way for the more modern
zu'chitecture. Some of the old streets are still narrow and tortuous,
but the new part of Sydney has wider and finer streets, and the old-
fashioned appearance of the city is steadily disappearing. The prin-
cipal streets are laid out to the cardinal points of the compass, and
intersect one another at right angles. They are called George, Pitt,
Market, King, and Hunter, the leading one being George Street, which
starts from the water's edge and runs through the city and out into the
country, where it becomes George Street West.

"George Street is named after George III., and Pitt Street after
his Prime-minister. The other principal streets, Macquarie, King, I-Iun--
ter, Bligh, and Phillip, bear the names of the early governors, and Mr.
Manson said it was fortunate that the governors were changed oftenPUBLIC BUILDINGS or SYDNEY. 299

enough in those days to permit no scarcity of names for the streets.
Here and there we saw some wooden buildings dating from the early
days of the colony; and there is an old hospital, and also an ancient
church which has pews such as we find in the churches of England one
or two hundred years old.

" St. J ames's Church, the one just mentioned, is old and uncomfort-
able, but the cathedral is just the reverse. The public buildings of
Sydney would take several or many pages for their description, and
the account would run the risk of being tedious before reaching the
end. When we remembered the age of the colony they surprised us
by their magnificence. The Government buildings in Macquarie Street,
the Post-office in George Street, the Town-hall, the University, the
Crown Lands Office, and several
other edifices would well adorn .., _
cities of much greater age than
Sydney, and yet some of the res-
idents complain that their build-
ings are not sufficiently grand for
their wishes, and suggest the dem-
olition of some of these structr
ures to make way for finer ones.
St. Andrew's Cathedral was begun
in 1819, and has been three times
pulled down and re-erected!

"We can't say much in favor
of the street-railways, or tram-
ways, of Sydney, most of which
have steam locomotives to draw
the cars. Two cars are coupled

charge passengers. Accidents are _, V .

the managers of the tram-ways
always declare that the fault is due to the carelessness of the victims.
They have flagmen at some of the more dangerous crossings, but in
spite of them somebody is occasionally run over; Strangers are espe-
cially liable to injury from this cause, as they are often unaware that
locomotives are allowed in the principal streets.
" Our ride was extended to the suburbs; and, without question, no
city we have thus far seen in the Southern Hemisphere has suburbs at
all approaching in attractiveness those of Sydney. First we come to
Wooloomooloo--what a. funny word that is to writel--and then we
wind along the coasts of the little bays between the promontories;
Elizabeth Bay, Rose Bay, Double Bay, Rushcutter's Bay, and I don't
know how many other bays and coves, where the well-to-do residents
have their villas. One hundred thousand people are said to live in
Sydney proper, and one hundred and fifty thousand in the suburbs, so
that the city, with its suburbs, has a population of a quarter of a million.

" Fred suggested that he would like to see the park or public gar-
den. Mr. Manson asked, ' Which one 2'

"Fred didn't know, and then our host explained that he had a. con-
siderable number to choose from. ' There is Albert Park,' said he, 'of
forty acres, with a statue of Prince Albert, and opposite to it is Hyde
Park Square, with a statue to Captain Cook, the discoverer of New
South Wales. Then there is the Domain, of one hundred and twenty-
eight acres, surrounding the littlebay known as Farm Cove, the Botan-
ical Gardens, of thirty-eight acres; and we have, in addition, Belmore
Park, Prince Alfred Park, Callan Park, Moore Park, Wentworth Park,
and the National Park; and a few years hence, if you come here
again, there will doubtless be "more parks to hear from." ' '

"During our stay at Sydney we saw most of the parks named in
the foregoing paragraph, and can testify to their beauty and the appre
ciation in which they are held by the inhabitants. The Domain and
the Botanical Gardens were especially attractive; their sites are bean-
tiful, and the Botanical Gardens contain every plant known in Aus-
tralia, together with exotics from nearly every country in the world.
For a student of botany these Gardens would furnish opportunities for
months or years of study.

"In the Botanical Gardens our attention was called to three Norfolk
pines that are said to have been planted here nearly seventy years ago;
one of them is ninety-five feet high, and its circumference, three feet
above the ground, is within a few inches of five yards. The other two
of the cluster are taller than this one, but not so large in girth. Then
they showed us a she-oak tree, which is said to give forth, when the
air is perfectly still, a sound like the murmur of a seashell. Another
curious growth is the Australian musk-tree, which constantly gives out
an odor which is perceptible several yards away. Trees and plants
from tropical and semi-arctic regions grow here side by side; the Can-THE AUSTRALIAN CONVICT SYSTEM. ' 301

ada fir almost touching the Indian bamboo, and the Siberian larch
mingling its branches with those of the palm and the banyan.

"In the evening and on the follmving day, Mr. Manson introduced
us to all the officials of prominence, and to many of the lending citizens.
It was a severe brain-tax to remember all their names, but we shall try
to do honor to our country in this particular. We have been invited
to so many houses that if we should stay here a month we could not
exhaust the list, and probably by the time the end was reached a new
list would be formed. The Australians are certainly a. hospitable peo-
ple, and the stranger has a 'lovely time' among them."

At their first opportunity Frank and Fred informed themselves
about the early history of the colony. Among other curious things
Fred made the following note:

"It seems that the people of the United States are indirectly re-
sponsible for the settlement of Australia by convicts. Here is a par-
agraph from page 18 of 'The Official History of New South Wales,' by
Thomas Richards, Government Printer, and Registrar of Copyright.

" ' . '. . Whilst America. was subject to England, British offenders, po-
litical or otherwise, were transported to the southern colonies of that
continent, or to the West Indies,
where they were in the first in-
stance employed chiefly in the
production of tobacco. The con
sumption of tobacco was large,
and the revenue derived there-
from considerable, Virginia and
Maryland being the chief pro-
ducers. The American colonies
having revolted against British
rule in 1776, and after a. long and
severe struggle gained their in-
dependence, England sought a.
new field for colonization, and
'first tried the coast of Africa,
but found if, unhealthy. 1-161- at. CANDIDATE non. Tnnssrounnou.
tentiou was then turned to Aus-
tralia, the eligibility of which for the purpose had been spreading since
Cook's famous voyage thither in 1768. Accordingly, a fleet of eleven
sail, carrying more than one thousand souls, was assembled at Ports-
mouth, in the month of March, 1787, to proceed to Australia.' "
Fred read the foregoing extract to Frank. The latter listened ear-
nestly, and then remarked :

" I don't see that times have greatly changed after all. England
still sends us her convicts and paupers, the only difference being that
she turns them loose upon us instead of deriving something for their
forced labor. Her example is followed by most of the continental
nations, and thus we get the human rubbish of the Old World, just as
we did before the Revolutionary War."

Fred then went on to say that the colony by which Sydney was
founded numbered one thousand and thirty persons, including seven
hundred and fifty--seven .convicts, among whom were one hundred and
ninety-two women and eighteen children. Besides the officers, there
were one hundred and sixty soldiers, with forty of their wives; the
live-stock included cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, and goats; and there was
a large stock of seeds from the tropic and temperate zones. The
natives did not oppose the landing, as they supposed it was only tem-
porary. When they found that the settlement was a permanent one
they became hostile, and many murders resulted, caused, no doubt, in
great measure by the outrages committed by' the convicts. Ships from
England followed steadily, each one bringing its quota of convicts, and
in a few years Sydney had quite a city-like appearance.*

Free emigration began a few years after the establishment of the
colony, as just described, the earliest of the free emigrants being princi-
pally men of capital, who came with the object of employing the con-
victs under contracts with the Government. Free emigrants of more

' 0n the 24th of January, 1888, the celebration of the centenary of New South Wales
was begun, the occasion being the anniversary of the landing of the first governor of the
colony. Lady Cnrringlon, the wife of the Governor, unveiled a statue of Queen Victoria in
the presence of the governors of all the Australian colonies, including New Zealnnd and
Feejee. The festival extended over a week, and included the dedication of Centennial
Park, the opening of the Agricultural Society's exhibition, and an internationnl regatta
and state banquets. On the 26th, the anniversary of Governor Phillip's proclaiming at
Sydney Cove the founding of the colony. there wus a general illumination. The city was
crowded with visitors, and the gathering thoroughly represented Australia. Special thanks
giving services were held on the opening day in the Anglican and Catholic cathedrals.
The ceremonies in the Catholic cathedral were attended by the archbishop and all the
bishops of Australia. Centennial Hall is one of the largest hulls in the world, and is on
the site of the old burial-ground of one hundred yours ago.

Melbourne celebrated the centennial year of the settlement of Australia by a World's
Exhibition, to which all nations were invited. South Australia had an International Ex-
hihilion at Adelaide in 1887. similar to the exhibitions of Sydney and Melbourne n few
years earlier.

modest means naturally followed, and in course of time the free settlers
were more numerous than the convicts and military combined. In 1831,
out of 76,793 persons in the colony 27,831 were convicts.

In the early part of this century Australia. had three classes of inhab-
itants--free settlers, convicts, and emancipists--the latter being convicts
who had served out their sentences and become free men. The free
settlers refused to associate with them, and they in turn would not asso-
ciate with the convicts; the free settlers were inclined to be tyrannical,
and wished to have the emancipists deprived of civil rights, and long
and bitter quarrels were the result of their demands. The governors
generally took the side of the emancipists as a matter of justice, and
thus made themselves unpopular with the rest of the colony.

While studying the early history of the Australian colonies, Frank
and Fred obtained considerable information from a gentleman who
seemed to be thoroughly familiar with the subject. As he made no
allusion-in any way to his ancestry, the youths thought it just possible
that he might be the son or grandson of one of the "involuntary emi--
grants " of early days. Desiring to respect his reserve as much as pos-
sible, they did not make any entry of his name in their note-books.
Their suspicions were strengthened by a remark which he dropped, that
it was not considered polite in Australian society to ask who and What
a man's father was.

" The term ' convict' is of course odious," said he, " no matter what
the circumstance that has caused it to be applied to a man. Many of
the convicts who were sent to Australia owed their transportation to
no worse ofl'ences than sympathizing with a rebellion, snaring a hare, or
catching a fish out of somebody's preserved pond. I knew a man who
was transported for seven years for nothing else than twisting the neck
of a partridge, and his case was very far from being a solitary one. In
the eye of the British law he was a criminal, a convict; but in the eye
of common-sense and humanity his respectability was not greatly tar-
nished. The Irish rebellion of 1798 caused great numbers of Irishman
to be transported; they were treated as criminals, and all sorts of indig-
nities were heaped upon them, but their only crime was that of seeking
to free their country."

Frank asked how the convicts were treated on the voyage from
England 'to Australia and after they arrived there.

"According to all accounts," was the reply, " they were very cruelly
used. On the transport-ships they were closely herded together, poorly
fed, and severely flogged for the least infraction of the rules. ManyA PUBLIC EDIFICE. 305

died on the voyage in consequence of the inhuman treatment they
received; in some cases the deaths were a fourth of the entire number.
On their arrival in Australia they were put at work in Government
establishments, or on public roads and wharves, or were hired out to
agricultural and other colonists. You must remember that those were
the days of brute force, and no oflicer in charge of convicts ever thought
of such a thing as moral suasiou and kindness, however much combined
with firmness. Flogging was of daily and almost hourly occurrence,
and administered for trivial offences; a historian of the colony says that
any man who failed to go to church on Sundays received twenty lashes
on his bare back. Prisoners were put in irons often at the mere caprice
of their keepers, their food was scanty, their clothing often insufficient
for the weather, and if a man ventured to run away he was pursued by
blood~hounds and bull-dogs and brought back, unless killed by the
natives or dead from starvation.

"Settlements were formed at several places along the coast of Aus-
tralia and in Van Dieman's Land (now Tasmania). The first convict
settlement in Tasmania was on a peninsula, and a row of bull-dogs was
chained across the narrow isthmus that connected the peninsula with
the main-land, so close together that it was impossible for a man to pass
between any two of them."

" I suppose the prisoners rarely managed to escape t" said Frank.

" Very rarely," said the gentleman. " There were many runaways,
but they were generally brought back and punished, and if their escape
was accompanied with violence they were hanged or shot. In the bush
they were liable to starve, and many a convict's bones are whitening
where he perished of hunger; the natives were hostile, and if a runa-
way escaped recapture and starvation, he was very likely to fall before
the spear of a black man.

"Some of the Irish convicts of 1798 were so struck by the similarity
between the Blue Mountains, about eighty miles from Sydney, and the
Connanght Hills of Ireland that they rushed 01f expecting to reach their
homes without difficulty. One man who had tried on the voyage out
to fathom the mystery of the mariner's compass felt sure that he could
find his way home if he only had the thing to steer by. He stole a
copy of a work on navigation, and tore out the first leaf, which had the
picture of a compass upon it. His theft was detected and punished,
and he never had an opportunity to try his system of paper-compass
navigation.

asked how his friend had got to China, and was much astonished to
learn that he haul reached a. farm a. few miles from Sydney, and his
acquaintance had been hired there as a, laborer.
" If you wish to learn how the convicts were brought from England
to Australia," continued their informant to Frank and Fred, " how they
lived when they got here, and how they were treated, read a story
entitled 'His Natural Life,' by Marcus Clarke, an Australian journalist
and litterateur. In the form of a novel he has preserved much of the
history of the old convict days. It is not altogether agreeable reading,
though it is instructive.

" All the colonists except the convicts themselves, and they had no
voice in the matter, protested against Australia being peopled by these
objectionable individuals, and protest after protest was made to the
Home Government. These protests had their effect, and in 1840 trans-
portation to New South Wales came to an end; an attempt was after-
wards made to renew it, but was never carried out. It was continued
later in Van Dieman's Land and other colonies, and in West Australia
until 1868, when it was brought to an end, not so much at the wish of
the people of West Australia as of those of the other colonies.

" And let me say in conclusion," he remarked, " that there are many
prominent citizens of Australia whose fathers or grandfathers were
transported, and nobody in his senses thinks any the worse of them in
consequence. There are some gentlemen high in official position--of
course it would not be polite for me to name them--who are thus
descended, and so are some of the wealthiest and most prominent citi-
zens in civil life. Everybody may be aware of it, but nobody talks of it
in public.

"In our political contests the opposing candidates use as hard lan-
guage about one another as the same class of men do in political contests
in the United States; they may say anything they please except that
the man they are denouncing is the descendant of a transported convict.
Whenever this is done, although the statement may be perfectly true,
the injured man can bring a suit for slander, and be certain of high
damages. Only a few years ago an aspirant for office was compelled to
pay ten thousand pounds for saying in a public speech that the man
against whom he was contending was the son of an 'involuntary emi-
grant ' from England."

The gentleman paused, and Fred took the opportunity to ask what
a ticket--of--leave man was in the days of transportation.

"As to that," was the reply, "tickets-of--leave are in use to-day in
other countries as well as in England, though they are not known by
that name. In the United States you have a system of remitting part
of a. sentence in case of good conduct, and we do the same in England.30'.)

Well, this is what the ticketof-leave was in Australia: a man received
a conditional pardon consequent upon good conduct up to the time it
was granted, and also conditioned upon continued good conduct during
the time it was in force. In Australia a ticket-of-leave man was
required to remain in a certain prescribed district, where his conduct
could be observed; in practice it often happened that the man ran away

and sought a home elsewhere than under the British flag. A good
many ticket-of-leave men found their way to the Feejee, Samoa, Society,
and other islands of the Pacific, where they led lives that often were
not in accordance with civilized rules. In consequence of their viola,-
tion of the permit granted them, they were always greatly alarmed
when a British ship appeared in the offing. '

"Many ticketof-leave men became good citizens; some of them
obtained grants of land, and established farms where they supported
themselves, and not a few of this class became prosperous and wealthy.
The mechanics found plenty of occupation in the cities and towns, and
thus there gradually grew up a population of emancipists, who have
been mentioned already. In the disputes about the rights of the eman--
cipists their cause was warmly espoused by Governor Macquarie, who
earned the title of ' The Prisoner's Friend.' Some excesses followed the
adoption of this policy, but the colony was benefited by it, and ulti-
mately all classes of freemen were admitted to an equal footing, and
the cessation of transportation in time caused a perfect commingling of
classes and an extinction of the 01d feud."

The conversation terminated here, and the youths thanked their in-SCENES IN THE HARBOR. 311

formant for What he had told them on this interesting subject. They
closed their note-books as soon as the interview ended, and then went
out for a. stroll. Curious to see the shipping in the harbor, they directed
their steps to the Circular Quay, the modern name of Sydney Cove,
where the original expedition landed, in 1788. The founders of the set
tlement could hardly recognize the cove should they revisit it today.

"Circular Quay," said Fred, in his account of their walk, "is at the
head of the cove, and has a length of one thousand three hundred feet,
available for the largest vessels. It has piers and pavilions for the
ferry-steamers, which are numerous and active, and the Government has
made a liberal expenditure for extending the wharfage accommodations
and erecting sheds for the storage of goods. The Australian Steam
Navigation Company have their wharves here, and several of their ves-
sels were loading or discharging at Circular Quay all at once.

"To give an idea of the commerce of Sydney with other parts of
the world, let me mention the various steamship lines whose vessels
were visible from this quay. .
One of the first to come with-
in our line of vision was a
great steamer of the Penin-
sular & Oriental Company,
familiarly known as the 'P.
&_ O.,' and not far from it
was another equally large
steamer belonging to the Ori-
ent line. Each of these com-
panies has a fortnightly serv-
ice each way between Eng-
land and Australia, and the
sharp competition between
them has had the efiect'of
reducing the price of passage
and securing rapid voyages. ' "cm-ans": "A-'L
A little farther away was a
steamer flying the tricolor of France; it belonged to the 'Compagnie
des Messageries Maritimes,' a rival of the P. & O. in Asiatic waters,
and at the principal ports of Asiatic and Australasian lands. The Aus-
trian flag was visible on a steamer of the Austrian Lloyds, and the
German flag upon a magnificent vessel of the North German Lloyds,

or ' Bremen Line.'
" Australia has an abundance of steam communication with the rest
of the world. The P. & 0. line has a. fortnightly service each way
between London and Sydney via, the Suez Canal, the other Australian
ports included in its itinerary being Melbourne, Adelaide, and King
George's Sound; the Orient line has a similar fortnightly service, also
by the Suez Canal, but omits King George's Sound from its list of Aus-
tralian ports. The North German Lloyds has a service each way every

four weeks between Sydney and Bremen, its Australian ports being Syd-
ney, Melbourne, and Adelaide; the Messageries Maritimes--French mail-
line--has a'similar four-weekly service eaoh way between Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, and Marseilles. Then there is a. four-weekly service
'each' way of the British India. Steam Navigation Company, between
Brisbane and Aden, connecting at Aden with the same company's line,
to and from London, and touching at Batavia, J ave, on every voyage.
The New Zealand Shipping Company and the Shaw Savill & Albion
Company have each a four-weekly service from London to New Zea-
land by way of the Cape of Good Hope and Hobart, Tasmania, andSTEAMSHIP LINES TO AND FROM AUSTRALIA. 313

    
 
 
 

their steamers return to London
by way of the Strait of Magellan,
Rio Janeiro, and the Canary Isl- _
ands. Last, but by no means least, SHIP-YARD scum;

is the four-weekly service each way

between Sydney and San Francisco, which has been already mentioned.

"All these steamship lines receive subsidies from the colonial govern-
ments, and all, With the exception of the American one, receive subsi-
dies from their home governments. It is a curious circumstance, and a
humiliating one, to Americans in Australia or having relations with the
antipodes, that the American line between San Francisco and Australia
is subsidized by the colonies, but receives nothing from the United
States, under whose flag it sails. Our commerce with Australia and
New Zealaud now exceeds twelve millions of dollars annually, and
could be greatly increased by the encouragement of regular and perma-
nent steam communication with the colonies.

"An officer of one of the steamers running to San Francisco spoke
to us, and remarked that he had met us in the last-named city just as
we \vere taking passage for Honolulu. He told us we could start from
Sydney for ' Greenland's icy mountains or India's coral strand,' or for
any other mountains or strands on the globe. ' That wharf to the east,'
said he, 'is called Wooloomooloo; it was built at a heavy cost, but the
water near it is too shallow for seagoing vessels of the deepest draught,
and it is principally used for coasting-vessels, of which you see there are
a great many.'
"Then he told us that Darling Harbor, on' the western side of the
city, had its entire frontage covered with wharres and quays. Grafton
Wharf, with its building, covers an area of more than three acres As
for drydock accommodations, he pronounced Sydney one of the best
ports he had ever seen. There are two or three docks that were good
enough for the ships of twenty years ago, but are of less importance to--
day. A few years ago the Government built a dock four hundred and
fifty feet long, and wide in proportion, and it was thought sufficient for
all necessities for years to come; but hardly was it completed before
it was found too short for the largest modern steamships, and so an-
other has been built that is six hundred and. eighty feet long, one hun-
dred and eight feet wide between the walls, and eighty-five feet in the
entrance--gate. How long will it be before they will find this deck too
small for the wants of commerce?

 

ON THE PARANA'I'I'A RIVER.

"In one year (1885) the number of British and foreign ships that en-
tered Port Jackson was 2601, with an aggregate tonnage of 2,088,307
tons. There are several ship building and repairing establishments
here; that of the Australian Steam Navigation Company alone covers
more than six acres, and employs nearly five hundred persons. A hun-
dred years ago this was a howling wilderness; that is, if the Australian
savages were accustomed to bowl, and I presume they were.INDUSTRIES OF SYDNEY. 315

"We could give figures about Sydney that would make your head
'an ant-hill of units and tens,' as Doctor Holmes says; but perhaps
you've had enough to convince you of the importance of the city. It
has six daily papers, weeklies so numerous that the list would be monot-
onous, and as for schools, churches, hospitals, clubs, hotels, and other
institutions of a great city, there are all that
could be reasonably expected. As to manu-
facturing industries, it has a great many facto~
ries, founder-ies, and engineering establishments;

for clothing alone there are more than fifty factories, employing from
fifty to four hundred hands ml), and the other manufacturing con-
cerns are in similar proportion."

Our friends went on a steamboat excursion to Parainatta, which
lies up the river of the same name, about fifteen miles from Sydney.
Next to Sydney, it is the oldest town in the colony, having been founded
in November, 1788; it was originally called Rosehill, but the name
was afterwards changed to the aboriginal one of Par-armatta. The
first grain raised in the colony was grown at Paramatta, and here the
earliest grants of land were made to convicts who had served their time
at hard labor and were entitled to become colonists. It is now a pros-
perous town with from eight to ten thousand inhabitants, and has a
considerable business in manufacturing. Along the banks of the river
and in the neighborhood of Paramatta, there are many flower-gardens,
from which Sydney is abundantly supplied with boutonnieres, bouquets,
and huge baskets of flowers at all seasons of the year.

"Our chief interest in Paramatta," said Fred, " was to see the
orange--groves, which have made the place famous throughout Australia.
We were accompanied by a gentleman who was well known both in
Paramatta and in Sydney, and he took us at once to the orangery of
the late Mr. Pye, who' devoted the greater part of his hfe to the intro-
duction and cultivation of this excellent fruit. They told us that more
than ten thousand oranges had been gathered in one season from a, single
tree! We have never eaten finer oranges in any part of the world than
at Paramatta, and the other fruits grown in the orchards of the place
are said to be equally good in their season. The oranges are best in
December, but they are gathered ripe during every month of the year.
Of course they wanted us to inspect some of the factories, hospitals,
and other public buildings, but our time was too limited, and were re-
turned to Sydney by railway instead of taking the steamboat back
again."

Other excursions were made in the suburbs of Sydney, and Doctor
Bronson and his nephews received invitations to visit some of the inte-
rior towns of the colony. One of their excursions was to Botany Bay,
which lies five miles from Sydney by land, the distance by sea'being
fully fifteen miles. A horserailway connects the village with Sydney,
and the ride is quite a pretty one. The chief object of interest is the
monument which marks the spot where Captain Cook landed in 1770,
and took possession of the place in the'name cf the British Crown.

The consideration of the up--country invitations was postponed until
the return of the'party from Queensland, whither they went as soon as
the sights of Sydney were exhausted How they went and what they
saw will be told in the next chapter.A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH. 317

voyage was of only a few hours' duration; even this limited time was
utilized by a. conversation about the political divisions of Australia and
the relations between thecolonies.

The conversation began with a question from Doctor Bronson as to
what the youths had learned on the subject since their arrival at Syd-
ney or on the voyage from New Zealand. Frank was the first to reply.
"We have read to you our notes," said be, "about the settlement of
New South Wales by the fleet of ships that came out from England by
order of the Government. New South Wales was thus the parent col-
ony, and the others, with one exception, are offshoots from it. In 1790
New South Wales established a penal colony on Norfolk 'Island, which
has since been given up to the Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of the
mutineers of the Bounty. Van Dieman's Land, or Tasmania, was set-
tled as a penal colony in 1803, by Lieutenant Bowen, who was sent from
Sydney with a few convicts and their guards, and formed a settle-
ment near the spot where the city of Hobart now stands. Queensland,

' under the name of Moreton Bay District, was settled in 1825 from Syd-
ney, and became a separate colony in 1859. Victoria, then known as
Port Phillip, and forming part of New South Wales, was colonized in
1803, and afterwards abandoned; it was permanently settled from Tas-
mania in 1835, and on July 1, 1851, the colony was separated from
New South Wales and became independent.

"South Australia was colonized by emigrants from Great Britain
in 1836, and West Australia: by a detachment of soldiers and convicts
from Sydney in 1826. New South Wales can thus claim the parentage
of all the colonies of the continent and its adjacent island, Tasmania,
with the single exception of South Australia.

"West, or Western, Australia is described by its name, as it occupies
the entire western part of the continent. South Australia is a mis-
nomer; the parent colony is in the southern part of the continent, but
its jurisdiction extends from ocean to ocean to the northern shore, and
includes the socalled Northern Territory, or Alexandra Land, which
will one (lay, no doubt, form an independent government. To the east-
ward of the Northern Territory and South Australia is Queensland, and
south of Queensland and eastward of South Australia is the parent col-
any of New South W'ales. Then comes the colony of Victoria, south of
New South Wales; territorially it is the smallest of all the colonies, but
it isn't small in any other way. Tasmania is a hundred and fifty miles
south of Victoria, from which it is separated by Bass's Strait, which pre-
serves, the name of its discoverer, Dr. George Bass of the Royal Navy." *

Frank paused a moment and gave Fred an opportunity to speak of
something he had just read about Doctor Bass. " He made his first ex-
pedition," said Fred, "in 1796, in an open boat eight feet long, in com-
pany with Midshipman (afterwards Captain) Flinders and a crew of one

boy. They narrowly escaped being drowned in the sea, and later in
being killed by the natives when the wind drove them ashore. In the
following year Doctor Bass went in a whale-boat, with a crew of six
men and provisions for six weeks, and found that the coast trended so
far to the west as to indicate the separation of Tasmania from the main-
land, and in the next year (1798) he obtained a sloop, and in company
with Captain Flinders actually sailed through the strait and deter-
mined the question." '

" I see you have been reading to advantage," the Doctor remarked.
" And please add to your notes that this same Doctor Bass is supposed
to have died a slave in the mines of Chili. He was arrested at Valpa-
raiso in consequence of a dispute with the authorities, and was never
again seen or heard of by his friends. There was a rumor that he had
been sent to the mines, and that was all." '

"If the Australian continent were divided into one hundred equal
parts," said Frank, "Victoria would include three, New South Wales
ten, Queensland twenty-three, South Australia thirty, and West Aus-
tralia thirty-four. The greatest length of Australia is about 2400 miles,
and its greatest width, between Cape York on the north and Wilson's
Promontory on the south, is 1971 miles. It has about 7750 miles of
coast-line, and an area of 2,944,628 square miles. A good idea. of the
extent of Australia may be had by comparing it with other countries.
It is about twenty-six times the area of Great Britain and Ireland, fif-
teen times the size of France, about one-sixth smaller than the whole of

the United States of America, and only about one-fifth smaller than the
whole of Europe."

Fred asked who gave it the appellation of Australia.

" The name was given by Captain Flinders, of whom we were speak-
ing a few moments ago," replied the Doctor. "His memory is pre--'
served in a river and a. mountain-range of the continent whose coast he
explored. On his return to Europe he was captured by the French,
and was held a prisoner from 1806 to 1810. He died in England in
181-}, shortly after publishing his book, 'A Voyage to Terra. Australis.' "

" There is a great part of the country not yet explored," said Frank,
as the Doctor paused. "A writer on this subject says that the unex-
plored region of the present day is almost entirely confined to Western
Australia and a large part of the northern territory of South Australia.
New South Wales and Victoria. have an area of four hundred thousand
square 'miles, almost every mile of which is fairly known; Queensland
may still have a small extent of unknown land in the far northern pen-A GREAT LAND, WlTl-I LITTLE WATER. 321

insula; South Australia. has at least two hundred and fifty thousand
miles unexplored or but little known; and West Australia. has fully
half a million square miles that have been crossed at intervals by the
tracks of a few explorers. In round figures, the extent of unexplored
or partially known country in Australia is more than double that of
the thoroughly known portion. The continent is almost fairly bisected
.by the overland telegraph line, which follows closely the track of Mac-
douall Stuart, the explorer, and the telegraph may be considered a line
of demarcation between the explored and unexplored portions."

"And have you ascertained why the continent has not yet been
thoroughly examined?" Doctor Bronson queried.

 

CLEARING IN AN AUSERAMAN I'Ollm.

" I have," Fred replied,.with alacrity,." and I presume Frank has
done so too. It is because there is no water in the interior of the min
tinent,' or but very little. If you look on the map you will see very few
rivers, and none of those that exist is of great size. Australia is nearly
as large as Europe, and see the difference in the rivers. Europe has the
Danube, Rhine, Volga, Don, Vistula, Seine, Rhone--all large rivers--
together with more than twice as many of lesser note, but all of them
important; while Australia has only a single river of consequence, the
Murray. There are hundreds of miles of coastline together where not
a single stream, great or small, flows into the sea, and some of the
interior rivers dry up and disappear in the hot season."

" I read about that too," said Frank; "the Murray and its tributar

21
ries, the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee, are lasting streams; but the Dar-
ling, a. river of considerable size, flowing into the Murray from the
north, has the Australian peculiarity of disappearing into quieksands
and marshes. With the exception of the Murray, all the other perma-
nent streams of Australia are short, and of little consequence; and, like
the rivers of New Zealaud, they have been clogged with water-crass,
which was introduced from England in the expectation that it would
be a great luxury."

 

A WATIERLBS RKGION.

" You have hit exactly upon the obstacle which has baffled Austra--
lian explorers," said the Doctor. "All who have sought to penetrate
the interior have suffered terribly from thirst, and some expeditions
that have never been heard from are supposed to have perished from
the same cause. The rainfall in the interior of the continent is slight,
the heat in summer is intense, and even in winter the thermometer
sometimes runs to a high figure."

"Then it is fair to suppose that the interior of Australia is practi-
cally of no use," Frank remarked.

"It is fair to suppose so," was the reply; "but some scientistsA COUNTRY or REVERSES. 323

believe that good pasture-land and habitable country will yet be found
in the interior, where the few explorers who have been there report
only a desert unfit to sustain human life and impracticable for settle-
ment. Artesian wells have been bored in many places, and a fair pro-
portion of them have succeeded in finding water. There is so much
territory in Australia, that it is not likely the capabilities or'disedvan-
tnges of all parts of it will be thoroughly known for many years to
come.

"And now," he continued, as he glanced at a book he held in his
hand, "let us read what an English author has written concerning this
strange country :

" 'Almost everything in nature is, in Australia, the reverse of what it is in England.
When we have winter they hnve summer; when we have day they have night; we have
our feet pressing nearly opposite to their feet. Then: the compass points to the south.
the sun travels along the northern heavens, the barometer rises with a southerly and falls
with a northerly wind. The animals are disproportionately large in their lower extremv
ities, and carry their young in a pouch; the plumage of the birds is beautiful, their notes
are harsh and strange; the swans are black, the owls screech nnd hoot only in the daytime;
(he cuckoo's song is heard only in the night. The valleys are cool, the mountain~tops are

 

AUSTRALIAN LVRB'BIRDS.
Warm; the north winds are hot, the south winds are cold, the east winds are healthy.
The bees are without sting,- tbe cherries grow with the stone outside; one of the birds has
a broom in its mouth instead of a tongue. Many of the beautiful flowers are without
smell; most of the trees are without shade, and shed their bark instead of their leaves;
some, indeed, are without leaves; in others the leaves are vertical. And even the geolog-
ical formation of the country, as far as ascertained, is most singular. In other parts of
the world coal is black, but in Australia they have bituminous coal as white as'chalk.

" 'Taken as a whole, the country, as far as explored, exhibits less hill and dale, with
less compact vegetation, than in most other parts of the world, In the interior there is a
bare, barren, stony desert, totally unfit for man or beast. A more or less broken chain of
mountains extends from Spencer Gulf, round the south coast, all along the eastern coast,
nnd round the northern coast, nearly to Limming's Bight. The rivers are few in number;
the watercourses are very low in summer, and frequently dried up; no dense forest exists,
as in America,- the herbage generally is thin, the grasses, although highly nutritious,
growing in patches. The highest peak is Mount Kosciusko, 6510 feet above sea, at the
head of the Murray, which is the largest Australian river, 2500 miles long.

" 'Austmlia contains no antiquities, and the tourist who expects to find the ruins of
temples, palaces, and pagodas is doomed to disappointment. It was discovered by the
Portuguese about 1580. and visited by the Spaniards in 1605, and by several navigators
down to Captain Cook in 1770, and settled in 1788. All its cities are of modern founda-
tion and growth; and Australia may be compared, in a general way, to that part of the
United States west of the Mississippi River.'

"We shall have an opportunity to verify many of these statements,"
said the Doctor, "when we travel in the interior." Then, turning to
.h'ranlt, he asked that youth what he had learned concerning the govern-
ment of the colonies.

"I learned that they are wholly independent of each other," was
the reply, "and furthermore, that there is great jealousy between them.
Each of the colonies must: be considered in many respects a. distinct;
province, having its own government, local laws, and customs regula-
tions. With the exception of West: Australia, they all enjoy responsi-
ble government, and that colony will no doubt have the same con-
stitutional privileges as the others before many years. The form of
government is a. modification of the British Constitution, the sovereign
being represented by the Governor, who is appointed by the Crown; the
House of Lords by the legislative council, nominated or elected; and the
House of Commons by the legislative assembly, elected by the people.

"The imperial laws are in force unless superseded by local enact
ments, and all acts passed by the colonial legislatures must receive the
assent of the sovereign before they can become laws. In each of the '
colonies the qualifications for exercising the franchise are placed very
low, and manhood suffrage is practically the rule. An effort. has been
made to league the Australian colonies into one great confederation;INTERCOLONIAL JEALOUSIES. 325

the friends of the movement are confident of its success in course of
time, but local jealousies have thus far prevented it."

"It doesn't take long to find out that the colonies are very jealous
of one another," Fred remarked. "It's a pity that this state of affairs
exists; but after all, it has done a. great deal towards the development

 

A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE.

and population of the country. Jealousy between communities and
colonies is the basis of enterprise, and many things have been done here
in consequence of competition that without it would never have been
(lone at all. When one colony sends out an exploring expedition another
does the same; when one establishes a system of cheap emigration the
rest will not be left behind. And so it goes through all their enter-
prises. It is exactly like the rivalry that existed between our 'Vestern
States and cities twenty years ago, and still exists to some extent."

" Spoken like a statesman," said the Doctor, as he nodded approv-
ingly towards his nephew. "Put your remarks on paper and send
them home; they may be beneficial to some of our friends in St. Louis
and Chicago."
Fred promised to do so, and when some time later he wrote out his
views he added the following:

" It's very funny to hear the people of one city or colony talk about
those of another. Each decries all the rest, and represents his own re-
gion as the only perfect one. Talking about the climate, a Sydney man
will tell you that the capital of New South Wales is quite exempt from
the cold Winds that make life unbearable in Melbourne and Adelaide.
The Melbourne man tells how you suffer from ' brickfielders' (hot and
dusty winds from the interior) at Sydney, and how the poor wretches
in Adelaide are perspiring at every pore with a temperature and hu-
midity like those of a Russian bath.

" Each colony has its own postal regulations, its own postage-stamps,
and its own rates for letters and other mail matter. New South Wales
is a land of free-trade, while Victoria, its neighbor, is a land of protect-
ive tariffs; each can demonstrate the advantages of its particular sys-
tem, and on the other hand each has a minority party that wants its
laws patterned after those of its rival. The gauges of the railways are
different, so that there is a break at every frontier; consequently pas-
sengers are obliged to change trains, and all freights bound across the
line must be transshipped. The enactments of the colonial legislatures
are often hostile to one another, and sometimes the rivalry expresses
itself so strongly that it seems unfortunate that the colonies have a.
common language.

"None of the colonies has any State Church, and all religions are
placed on the same footing. The Episcopalians are the dominant body
so far as numbers are concerned. the Roman Catholics are next, and
then come the Presbyterians, and after them the Methodists. These
are the four great denominations; far below them in numbers and in
their order of strength are the Lutherans and Gennan-Protestants, Bap-
.tists, Congregationalists, Jews, Bible Christians, Church of Christ, Uni-
tarians, and Free Presbyterians. The Asiatic proportion of the popula-
tion adds Moslems, Confucians, and Pagans to the list of religiouists.
Considering the recent settlement of the colonies, the proportion of
places of worship to the population will compare favorably with other
countries.

" There is a tendency to exclude religious teaching from the public
schools, and in place of this there is a wide-spread interest in Sunday-
schools, which abound all over the continent wherever it has been
settled. In the matter of education the colonies are happily actuated
by the same impulse, all believing that it is one of the vital principles
of good g6vernment. The children are taught either wholly or par--
tially by the aid of the Statefunds of each province, and in nearly all
the colonies a. separate department, under a minister of the Crown,
controls the machinery of education.

" The leading principles of education in Australia are that it is free,
or very nearly so. It is compulsory, and it is secular, though not in all
cases, to the absolute exclusion of Bible-reading. The latest reports at
hand show that there are 5844 State schools in Australia, with 553,191
pupils and 11,890 teachers. There are numerous high-schools, acad-
emies, and denominational schools in the cities and larger towns, and
there are colleges and universities at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide."
We will now drop the journals and statistics of Frank and Fred,
and attend to what they saw and heard on their journey.

We left them on their way to Newcastle, which they reached with-
out mishap. A fellow -passenger told them that several disastrous
wrecks had occurred at the entrance of Newcastle Harbor, which was
formerly very dangerous when the wind blew heavily from the south-
east. A breakwater has been constructed that greatly diminishes the
danger, as it protects the bar from the heavy seas which formerly
swept over it. Newcastle is the outlet of a considerable extent of
country, but its principal business is in coal, of which it ships more than
two million tons annually. The tOwn has many evidences of prosperity,
and its appliances for handling coal are extensive and excellent.

One of the citizens volunteered to show our friends the coal-mines.
'While they were making the round of the place he said that a care-
ful estimate showed that the coal-seams now being worked contained
enough coal to keep up the present rate of production for five hundred
and twelve years. There are thirty-five seams of coal, varying from
five to twelve feet in thickness, and one seam--the Greta--is twenty-
one feet thick. Nearly five thousand miners are employed under-
ground, and one thousand at the mouths of the mines. The deepest
workings are those of the'Greta, four hundred and fifty feet, and the
Stockton,three hundred and eighty feet. The authorities of N eweastle
believe they have the finest appliances for handling coal that are to be
found anywhere, and Doctor Bronson said he certainly did not know
of any that su1passed them.

Since the visit of our friends we are told that the railway from
Sydney to Newcastle has been completed, and also the line which con-
nects with the one from Brisbane, at the frontier between New South
Wales and Queensland. From Newcastle they went by land to Bris-
bane; near Tenterfield they left the railway for a coach-ride of forty
miles, which brought them to Stanthorpe, where they found a train to
carry them to their destination. At several points on their coach-ride
they saw the working parties making cuttings and fillings along the
route for the 1 ailwaya that now completes the connection bbetween the
capitals of the colonies of Queensland and New South Wales. There
is now continuous railway communication from Brisbane to Adelaide,
a distance of very nearly eighteen hundred miles.

The train left Newcastle at 7.15 in the morning, and brought them
to Tenterfield at a little past midnight, the distance being three hun-
dred and eighty-one miles. It carried them through a country of.' RAILWAYS IN NEW SOUTH WALES. 329

varied characteristics--hill, valley, plain, mountain, forest, and open
country presenting themselves in succession. "It can be briefly de-
scribed," said Frank, "as an agricultural, pastoral, and mining region,
some of it being of great value, and other parts quite forbidding in
aspect, owing to the scarcity of water. We passed through some of
the gold-fields of New South Wales, but did not stop to visit them.
We were told that considerable quantities of diamonds had been ob-
tained near Bingera, one hundred and ten miles north from Tamworth.
an important town on the railway, about half-way between Newcastle
and Tentertield.

"The names of stations on the line of railway are a curious mixtr
are of native and foreign words; the foreign ones including English.
Scotch, Irish, and American, together with some that were difficult to
classify. For example, there were Murrurundi, Boggabri, Currabubula,

and Moonbi, all of Australian origin; and then we found Hamilton.
Lochinvar, Dundee, Stonehenge, Emerald Hill, Kentucky, and other
familiar words. Then followed Doughboy Hollow, Honeysuckle Point,
Kelly's Plains, and Willow Tree, which reminded us of names that we
had heard in the Pacific States of America.

" Occasionally we saw herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, and were
not surprised to learn that the country is considered an excellent
region for raising those animals. We passed through forests of gum-
trees, as they are called here, the ordinary appellation of the Eucalyptus,
of which there are many varieties. Compared with the trees of Eng--
land and America, the gum-tree is not beautiful, and no one would think
of growing it for ornament alone, but on the whole it is by no means
ill-looking. The leaves do not spread out horizontally, but depend

vertically from the boughs. Consequently the tree gives little shade
in the daytime, but the traveller who passes through a gum forest at
night blesses this peculiarity of the tree, as it admits the light of the
moon and stars, to the great advantage of the wayfarer. Compared
with European trees, the verdure of the Eucalyptus is scanty, and its
green is rather sombre. Some of the varieties of this tree are far more
attractive than others, the handsomest of all being the Banksia, named
after Sir Joseph Banks.

"The Eizcalyptus amygdalina, or giant gum, has the reputation of
being the tallest tree in the world, and the Australians are greatly
pleased to mention this fact. There are reports of giant gum-trees that
exceed five hundred feet in height, but the highest one 'with an official
record is on Mount Baw-Baw, Gippsland; it was measured by Mr.
II-Iodgkinson, a civil engineer, who certifies to its height of four hun-
dred and seventy-one feet. This is considerably more than the height
of the tallest of the Big Trees of California, according to the authori-
ties we have consulted. New groups and forests are discovered from
time to time, and perhaps one of these days we shall hear of a giant
that exceeds five hundred feet. 'VARIETIES AND PECULIARITIES OF THE EUCALYPTUS. 331

" The Eucalyptus has been carried to other countries, and it seems
to do well all over the world where the climate is not too cold for it.
It grows rapidly, and is said to prevent malaria and fevers; we asked
Doctor Bronson about the latter statement, and he said he was greatly
inclinel to believe it. The French introduced it into Algeria, and found
that fevers diminished rapidly or disappeared altogether where it grew,
and they are so thoroughly convinced of its utility that they have
planted great numbers of Eucalypti. Mr. Bosisto, commissioner for Vic-
toria. at the colonial exhibition in London, 1886, discusses this subject
thoroughly, and says that malarious diseases are not native to Australia,
and imported fevers diminish in violence. He thinks this effect is
caused by the Eucalyptus, which is evergreen and constantly exhausting
humidity from the earth, and throwing off oil and acid from its leaf.
A small quantity of Eucalyptus-oil sprinkled in a sick-room improves
the air at once and renders breathing easier. Mr. Bosisto contends that
the volatile oil thrown off by the leaf absorbs atmospheric oxygen and
transforms it into ozone.

" The giant gums are sometimes called ' silver stems,' for the reason
that after they have annually shed their bark--they shed their bark
and not their leaves--the new skin is of the whiteness of silver. As
the trunk is perfectly round, and the lowest limbs are often two hun-
dred feet and more from the ground, the sight of a group of these enor-
mous trees is a very fine one. The giant gums are more slender than
the Big Trees of California; the former are the tallest in the world, but
the latter have the greater diameter in proportion to their height.

"Next to the giant gum is the red gum, or Micah/plus rash-ate, and
next to that is the blue gum, or Eucalyptus globua. The former is the
finest timber-tree, while the latter is the most favored for its anti-fever
qualities and is 'the tree most frequently carried to foreign lands.
Don't expect me to go through the whole catalogue of Eucalypti, as
there are fully two hundred of them, according to the botanists; the
lowest and most widespread is the Eucalyptus dmnosa, or mallee scrub,
and you may judge of its extent when I tell you that a single tract
of mallee scrub shared between South Australia and Victoria covers an
area of nearly nine thousand square miles. 'And it isn't the largest
area. of scrub, either,' says an Australian at my elbow.

" Well, the mallee is a strange-looking plant, and I can compare it to
nothing better than the frame of an umbrella turned bottom up and
without any handle in the centre. It has a globular mass at its base,
with a few horizontal roots, and then a long taproot that goes down
to a great depth till it reaches moisture. Above-ground there are a lot
of shoots, or stalks, from a foot up to twenty feet long, each of them
having a tuft of leaves at the top.

" N 0 surface water can be found in the districts where it grows, and
the scrub is just a little more than high enough to hide a man on horse-
back. To be lost in the scrub is
very dangerous; you cannot see 3

have been told us of
the death of people lost in the scrub; men have gone there to search
for missing friends, and both searchers and sought have never been
heard of again."
It was after midnight when our friends reached Tenterfield, and at
nine o'clock the next morning they were on the coach and dashing
away towards Stanthorpe. Over the plains and hills they went at good

\
speed, and were reminded of previous rides in the newly opened regions
of the Rocky Mountains and in California. Coaching in Australia is
less famous than formerly, owing to the rapid extension of the railway,
but there are still many interior lines where the old system is main-
tained. Coaching in Australia owes its development to some enterpris-
ing Americans--Cobb & Company--who went there in the times of the
gold discoveries, and established lines over all the principal roads, from
the coast ports to the auriferous districts. The wonderful tales of
coaching west of the Missouri River a quarter of a century ago might
be repeated concerning the same business in Australia.

Doctor Bronson and his companions had no time to examine the
mineral and other attractions of Tenterfield, though they were invited
to do so. Gold, silver, t-in, antimony, plumbago, and other minerals are
found in the region round about the town, at distances varying from

 

FED" TRNTERFIELB m STAS'HIORI'B. '

five up to forty miles. Some mining localities were pointed out along
the coach-road, and rich specimens of gold'bearing quartz were shown
by the fortunate possessors.

Cobb's coach carried them safely to Stanthorpe, sometimes called
the Border Town, owing to its position on the frontier, and the Sana-
torium of Queensland, in consequence of the salubrity of its climate. It
is celebrated for its tin-mines, which are scattered around the neighbor-
hood; the product varies considerably from one year to another, being
affected by the scarcity or the abundance of water.

They spent the night at Stanthorpe in a fairly comfortable hotel,
and at nine o'clock on the following morning left by train for Brisbane
--two hundred and seven miles--where they arrived at half-past ten in
the evening. ' '

Frank and Fred were out the next morning at an early hour to see
the sights of the capital of Queensland. They found it smaller than
Sydney, the total population within a radius of five miles of the centre
of the city being less than a hundred thousand. It is on the river Bris-
bane; river and city were named after Sir Thomas Brisbane, the gov-
ernor of the colony of New South Wales in 1825, the year when the
city was founded as a penal settlement. The river surrounds it on two
sides, and gives it an excellent water frontage; from the city to the
debouchement of the river into Moreton Bay is about twenty-five miles
by the course of the stream, though not more than half that distance
overland.

Their walk took them along Queen Street, the principal avenue, to
Victoria Bridge,a fine structure of iron which spans the river between
North and South Brisbane. The bridge is more than one thousand feet
in length, and divided into thirteen spans, with a swing in the centre to
permit the passage of vessels. Like most works of the kind, it is said to
have cost more than double the original estimates of the engineers who
planned it.

The youths were not favorably impressed with the streets of Bris-
bane, on account of their narrowness, Queen Street being little more
than sixty feet wide, and the others in the same proportion. They
asked why the streets were made so narrow, when there was such an
abundance of land in Australia at the time the place was founded, and
were told that it was due to the orders of one of the early governors,
Sir George Gipps, who wished to be economical with the land of the
Government. But if Queen Street is narrow it is by no means unat-
tractive, as it can boast of many fine shops and substantial buildings,
including several belonging to the Government. Frank called Fred's
attention to the verandas that on one side of the street ran almost from
one end to the other, and extended quite across the sidewalk. Fred
rightly conjectured that they were intended to screen pedestrians and
goods from the heat and glare of the sun, Brisbane being blessed with a
climate of tropical character.

A policeman of whom they made inquiry pointed out the post-
ofiice, town-hall, and exchange, the two last-named being in one build-
ing, which also contains the chamber of commerce and the council-
chamber, and also the courthouse and other public edifices. They wereTHE PARKS 0F BRISBANE. . 335

all fine buildings with the exception of the court-house, which is a. low,
solid-looking structure of stone, two stories in height, and of unattractn
ive appearance. Fred asked the policeman the reason of the difference
in these buildings.

"The courthouse is one of the old prisons of the days of the con-
vict system," was the reply ; "it was the female penitentiary and work-
shop, and at one time was crowded with women who had been trans-
ported from England to spend the rest of their lives in Australia. It
will probably be torn down
before many years, as the peo-
ple want to get rid of every-
thing that can remind them
of the convict system."

Turning to the right at
the end of Queen Street, and
close to Victoria Bridge, they
walked along William Street,
past the museum, and the
Houses of Parliament, till
they came to the Govern-
ment Domain, which contains the
residence of the colonial governor.
Close by are Queen's Park and the
Botanical Gardens, and here they
lingered until it was time to re-
turn to the hotel and meet Doctor
Bronson, who had announced his in- . . . , .
tention of sleeping till a late hour. ii ' I . I;

The river makes a sharp bend around A uneasy.

Brisbane, and the Government Domain,
Botanical Gardens, and Queen's Park are prettily situated at the end
of the point of land enclosed in the bend. In colonial parlance it is
called a "pocket," and Queen Street may be said to run across the top
of the pocket, as it extends from the river to the river again, just as the
numbered streets of New York go from the water on one side of Man-
hattan Island to the water on the other.

Flank and Fred thought they had nowhere seen more attractive
Botanical Gardens than those at Brisbane. They were particularly
impressed with the row of trees that lined the river-bank; they resem-
bled pines, and were of a sugar-loaf shape, and the custodian of the place
  
  
  
  
  

said they were
known as bun-

All the shrubs and
plants indigenous to
the colony are to be
found in the Gardens, to-
gether with exotics from
all parts of the world whose
climate in any way resem-
bles that of Queensland.
Our friends were told that
the Gardens had been of
' great practical value to the
colony in facilitating the in-
troduction of plants which

oped them, and then sent seeds and cuttings to those who made applir
cation. Sugar and cotton were also developed from the same source,
and at present the sugar and cotton interests of the colony are of very
great importance.

On their way back to the hotel the youths again encountered the
communicative policeman. Pointing in the direction of a round build-
ing similar to a windmill and supporting a signal-mast, he said,

" That is whet we call the Observatory, and it is used for signalling
vessels coming into the harbor. It's one of the relics of the conin'ct
time; there was once a windmill there where they ground the grain for
the convicts to eat, and when the wind didn't blow the prisoners had to
work a treadmill in the lower part of the building. I used to know an
old fellow who had often done his 'trick at the wheel;' he said he used
to have to go it four hours on a stretch, and when through with his
trick he was ready to lie down and take a rest. There isn't any part
of the treadmill there now, as it was quietly stolen away by the boys,
who sold the old iron for a good price."

THE sights of Brisbane were soon exhausted, and our friends ar-
ranged to make a journey to the interior, in spite of the efforts of
hospitable residents to detain them for several days in the capital. The

population than in Australia, and in no other country was the stranger

sion, and it was renewed at every place they visited during their jojur-
ney through the continent. Frank thought that the name of Australia
Felix, which was originally applied to the Port Phillip district, should
be given to the entire country, in view of the general amiability of the
inhabitants and their courtesy to strangers.

Doctor Bronson and his nephews desired to make a study of " bush
life," and an excellent opportunity was offered in an invitation to spend
as long a time as they chose at an interior station in Queensland. Ris-
ing at an early hour one day, they took the train of the Southern &
Western Railway at 5.40 A.M., and rode straight through to Roma, three
hundred and seventeen miles, which they reached at ten o'clock at
night. The railway continues to Morven, one hundred and ten miles
distant, and from that point it will be extended in the near future--
at least such is the promise--two or three hundred miles farther. The
original scheme was to carry it to Point Parker, on the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, a distance of one thousand miles from Brisbane; but in conse-
quence of the great expense of the undertaking, the completion of the
line has been indefinitely postponed.

The railways of Queensland are on the special narrow-gauge prin-
ciple, the rails being only three feet six inches apart. The gauge of
New South Wales is four feet eight and a half inches, and that of Vie-
toria five feet three inches. In South Australia the Port, North, and
Southern lines, are of five feet three inches gauge, and other lines are
three feet six inches or like the Queensland railways. For sparsely
settled regions the narrow gauge has been found serviceable and eco.
nomical, and thus far there has been no occasion for express trains at a
high rate of speed.- As on many of the smaller lines of the United
States and other countries, the so--called "express" trains stop at all
stations, and are not famous for their rapid progress.

The country through which our friends travelled was not unlike that
between Newcastle and Brisbane, as already described. For some dis-
tance the railway lay along the valley of the Brisbane River, which
contains some excellent farming country, with fine stretches of woodland
and occasional swamps. The dividing range of mountains filled the

, western horizon, and the labored puffing of the locomotive at frequent
intervals told that the grade was an ascending one. In the immediate
vicinity of Brisbane the land is of poor quality, except in the neighbor-
hood of the streams, and in the early (lays of the colony a great many
settlers were ruined by attempting to establish farms where the soil
was not suitable. But in spite of these early discouragements the capa-
bilities of the region have been developed by the perseverance of the
settlers; at present the visitor to the district around Brisbane will see
prosperous farms, vineyards, orchards, and gardens, though he will still
find a great deal of land that is practically unoccupied.

 

AMONG THE I'OWHILLS.

At a station a few miles out from the city the train halted for sev-
eral minutes, and gave Frank and Fred an opportunity to glance at one
of these suburban farms. The house of the owner was embowered in
vineyards, and close by was a field or plantation of pineapples, which
grow here in great profusion, and are of delicious quality. Frank asked
the name of a vine that had crept over the roof of the house and almost
concealed it from sight; he learned that it was known as the passion-
fruit, and was a native plant, producing a very pleasant tart fruit, which
unfortunately was not then in season. There was a garden at one side
of the house, and in it were all the vegetables of an English garden,
including several kinds of melons, besides ginger, arrow-root, sweet-
potatoes, and other tropical and semi-tropical productions. Farther
back was an extensive field of sugar-cane, which was flanked on one
side by a field of oats, and on the other by rows upon rows of luxuriant
maize, or Indian com.

"This is a wonderful region," said a. gentleman who accompanied
our friends, as the train moved on.. " Probably there is no other place
in the world where the products of the tropics and temperate zones
grow so well together, and certainly there is none where they grow any
better. Apples, peaches, pears, cherries, and other northern fruits areFRUIT PRODUCTS 01" QUEENSLAND. 3-11

side by side with the lemon, orange, citron, pomegranate, fig, and guava.
It took us a. long while to find out exactly what was wanted, and during
that time living was very dear in Brisbane. Now the city has a. plenti-
ful supply of fruit at very low prices, coming from the numerous gar-
dens in its vicinity. Irrigate the soil abundantly, and it will produce
almost anything in the world that you want. We send great numbers
of pineapples and bananas to Sydney and Melbourne, and also to the
higher country west of us.

" You already know," he continued, " that Australia is a, land of con-
tradietions, when considered from the stand-point of England or the

 

PICKINO "as.

United States. In your country the land with the heaviest timber is
the best for agriculture after the wood is cleared away, but here it is
often just the reverse. The largest trees which cost most money to
remove are quite likely found on soil that refuses to produce grass when
the land has been cleared, or if it produces grass or grain at all it is not
enough to pay the cost of clearing. It is in this particular that so
many of the earlier settlers ruined themselves, by expending time and
money in clearing up ground that afterwards proved worthless."

 

A Clan-"HS" XX 1m: SCRUB.

In the course of the conversation that followed, the gentleman
spoke frequently of "scrub" and "forest" land, as though they were
distinct from each other. Fred politely asked what was the difference
between them. -

"Scrub lend," replied the gentleman, "is distinct from forest land
in several features, but particularly in that of undergrowth. Scrub in
Queensland means the low land on the banks of the rivers; it is covered
with a dense growth of trees intermingled with a. denser growth of
vines and creepers, which in many places render it impossible to pro-
ceed without cutting one's way through with a. tomahawk or large
knife. The vines run to the tops of the highest trees, and frequently
cross from tree to tree, so that the whole area seems bound together
with festoons of green couiage.THE QUEENSLAND SCRUB. 343

"There is a genuine bit of Queensland scrub," said he, pointing to
what seemed an almost solid mass of verdure several acres in extent.
"It contains cabbage and other palms, fig-trees which tower above most
of their fellows, but are overtopped by the bunya, pine, and red cedar,
though the latter are not very numerous. An agile sailor might climb
from one side to the other of that scrub without once going to the
ground; and as for a group of monkeys or squirrels, it would be no
effort at all for them to make the journey.

"Of course we're too far off to hear any sounds there, but if you
could be under the shade of those trees you would find that the scrub
is full of life. I speak only of sunrise and sunset; at noon the place is
as quiet as a cemetery, but in the morning and evening quite the re

will quite likely get a glimpse
of wild turkeys and other birds that make their home there and shun
the limbs of the trees. Keep a sharp eye out, too, as you may come
across snakes, and some of them are poisonous."

Fred was about to ask concerning the snakes of Australia, but their
loquacious friend did not give him a chance to do so. He pointed to
the opposite side of the train, and told the youths to observe what was
there visible.

" That shows you the difference between scrub and forest," said he;
"the forest land has heavier timber, but no underbrush; you can ride
on horseback through it, while you cannot get along on foot in the
scrub without a hatchet. I'm speaking now of the vine scrub along
the coast," he continued ; "in the interior we have myall, brigelow,GERMAN SETTLERS AND VINICULTURE. 345

mallee, and other scrubs of a totally different character. The forest
land is monotonous; you may travel hundreds of miles through it, and
find every mile so nearly like every other one that it is very hard -to see
any change. An experienced bushman knows the difference, but to a
novice it is all the same."

The train ascended the slopes of the hills leading to the Dividing
Range, having left the river at Ipswich, the head of navigation, and
twenty-three miles from Brisbane. The Dividing Range presents a. pre-
cipitous front, and great engineering skill was required to carry the
road over it, the chain being passed at an elevation of two thousand six
hundred feet. The scenery, as the range is mounted, is magnificent.
The line vies with the Union Pacific Railroad in the United States in
tall, spider-like bridges spanning fearful gorges, and in tracks passing
round the precipitous spurs of the mountains. Cuttings and tunnelling
are met with from the moment the ascent commences. The steepest
gradient is one in fifty. Notwithstanding the apparent danger attend-
ing a, journey on this portion of the line, no accident involving loss of
life or serious injury to rolling stock has occurred here since the first
engine ran on it. '

Ipswich is in a mining and agricultural district, several rich seams
of coal having been opened in its neighborhood, and the country around
it being well adapted to farms. At Toowoomba, one hundred miles
from Brisbane, their guide told the youths they were at the principal
town of the rich pastoral district called the Darling Downs; the region
was discovered and settled in 1827, and named after Sir Ralph Darling,
who was then governor. Agriculture and the raising of cattle and sheep
are the principal industries, and the town bears every evidence of pros-
perity.

"There are many Germans settled in this neighborhood," said Mr.
Watson, the gentleman who accompanied our friends, "and they are
largely interested in grape- growing and the manufacture of wines.
Many thousand gallons of wine are made here every year; the grapes
are ripe in January, and I have seen single bunches weighing fifteen
pounds and over."

Frank asked how the wines of Queensland and Australia. in general
compared with those of other countries.

" Of course our wine-making is in its infancy," was the reply; " and
thus far our products will hardly bear favorable comparison with the
wines of Europe, where the industry has been prosecuted for centuries;
but we think they are fully equal to the wines of the United States,
 

CHI-LABS FOR STORING WINK.

where the business is only a little older than it is with us. All the col-
onies are giving much attention to grape- growing; the yield is very
large; but in the last few years the vines have suffered considerably
from phyllowem, though fortunately all parts of the colonies have not
been affected by it.

"We make so much wine, and it is so cheap and good," the gentle-
man continued, " that it ought to be the drink of the people, just as in
France, Spain, Italy, and the other countries of Southern Europe. Very
little wine is used by the laboring classes; some do not drink at all,
others drink occasionally, and others daily and hourly if they have the
opportunity, but nearly all prefer spirits to wine. What makes the mat-
ter worse is that the spirits are very bad in' quality, and their consump-
tion leads to much wretchedness and degradation, just as in Europe and
America. Some of the working people drink beer, as in England, and
in all the cities and large towns there are extensive breweries that do a
good business.

" Competent and conscientious judges say that the ordinary Austrar
lian wines are better than the same grades sold in Paris and other
French cities. They are the pure juice of the grape, the juice being so
abundant and cheap that it does not pay to adulterate it. In Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane a man can buy for threepence a glass
of as fine an ordinary wine as was ever made; it is nutritious and
wholesome, but unfortunately the great majority of the laboring classes
prefer to swallow the vile decoctions that are sold under the names of
spirits. Our capabilities in Wine-making are absolutely unlimited; we
are shipping some of our products to Europe, where they take. the place
of the ordinary wines of France and Spain, and quite possibly you get
many casks of them in New York and other American cities, where
they are sold as Bordeaux wines."AUSTRALIAN WINES. 347

" There's a great deal in a name," said Doctor Bronson, " especially
when wines are to be considered. N o doubt' we have your Australian
'common wines in America under the name of Bordeaux or Burgundy,
just as we have our own products. Thousands of casks of California
wines are sold every year on the Atlantic seaboard, but not under their
own name. Ofl'ered as California Wines they would not find a market,
but as Bordeaux wines they have a ready sale."

"And I have been told," said Mr. Watson, "that the Californian,
although very enthusiastic about his own State, will not drink its wine.
Am I right ?"

"According to my observation, you are," the Doctor replied. "I
do not think I ever saw a bottle of native wine on the table of a resi>>
dent of California. Hotel-keepers in San Francisco have told me that

 

clflKBB LABORBRS IN A VINEYARD.

those who order California wines at dinner are invariably strangers;
a Californian would almost consider himself disgraced if he should
do so."

"Well, it is pretty much the same in Australia," said Mr. Watson.
"We are proud of our country and what it produces, but we prefer
French champagne to our own sparkling wines, and Spanish sherry to
what comes from our vineyards and wine cellars. And not altogether
without reason, I must confess, as we have not yet reached perfection
with our fine Wines."

From wine-culture the conversation naturally turned to the labor
question, which Mr. Watson said was one of the perplexities of Queens-
land. The climate is too hot to permit the white man to work in the
fields and other places where
severe manual exertion is re-
quired, with the exception of
the elevated regions of the
Darling Downs and some oth-
er comparatively cool places.
Consequently there has been
a necessity for imported labor,
and in endeavoring to secure
it Queensland has had a great
deal of trouble.

In previous chapters we
have alluded to the Poly-
nesian labor-trade, much of

"0mm" Ausuuulm, which was carried on in the

interest of the sugar-planters

of Queensland. There were many abuses in its early days, but at pres-

ent the trade is under so many restrictions that the laborers have little

cause for complaint. The natives are brought to the colony for three

years; the master is bound to give them food and lodging, thirty dol-

lars a year wages, and then pay their passage home in addition to the

outward passage which he has paid to the ship-master who brings the
laborers from their islands.

By the last census there were about six thousand Polynesians in
Queensland, ten thousand five hundred Chinese, and about two thou-
sand inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago. The Chinese, like the
Polynesians, are mostly employed in outdoor work, though a consider-
able number of them are utilized as house-servants, and in other domes--
tic einployments. They go to Australia to earn a certain amount of
money, and then return home, just as they come to the United States.
Of more than ten thousand Chinese in Queensland; all but forty-nine
were men; and no matter how prosperous a Chinese may be in Aus-
tralia, he rarely thinks of taking his family there.

Frank asked what was the total population of the colony.

"Not far from three hundred and fifty thousand," was the reply.THE ABORIGINALS OI" QUEENSLAND. 349

" There is an excess of males in the population, as is always the case in
a new country, the proportions of men to women being about three to
two. About onehalf the population were born in the Australian col-
onies, and of the remainder fully three--fourths came from Great Britain.
The colony encourages immigration by means of assisted or free pas-
sage, grants of land, and other inducements, and maintains constantly
an agent in London who forwards the interests of Queensland in every
way in his power."

" How many natives are there in the colony Z" queried Fred.

"I am afraid if I answered your question without an explanation,"
said Mr. Watson, with a smile, "I should give you a wrong impres-
sion. By natives I suppose you mean the aboriginal inhabitants of
the country i" '

" Certainly," replied Fred.

" In Australia, when we speak of natives," Mr. Watson answered,
" we mean white people who were born in the country, in contrast to
those who have migrated
from England, and other
lands. When referring to '
the aborigines we call them
so, and we also call them
' blacks' or ' blackfellows.'
At the last census there
were 148,162 natives, or .
whites, born in the colonies,
living in Queensland, and
about 20,000 aborigines. The
latter number is an estimate
only, as it is impossible to
take the census of the black
population."

"If you want to see the
difierence between a native
and an aboriginal," said the
gentleman, "look where I am mm com. "mums.
pointhig."

The youths followed with their eyes the direction of his finger, and
saw a white man and a black one standing near each other, close to
the little station where the train was halted, some miles beyond Too-
woomba. The black man was in civilized garb and had a muscular
frame, quite like that of an able-bodied negro in the southern part of
the United States. His garments were coarse and rough, his hair was
black and bushy, and his chin was covered with a beard that seemed to
more than rival his hair in its swarthiness.

" The white man is probably a sheep or cattle raiser," said Mr. Wat-
son, " and the black is one of his assistants."

" From that I suppose the blacks are employed about the farms and
pastoral stations," Fred remarked.

"Certainly," responded Mr. Watson. " Nearly every station in
Queensland has one or two blackfellows employed on it as stock-
riders, a capacity in which they are very useful. They are good riders,
and quite equal to your American Indians in following a trail. They
will track lost cattle and sheep when a white man would be utterly
unable to do so; and we have a police force of blacks, commanded by
Europeans, who perform excellent service in hunting down highwaymen
and other rascals who have taken to the bush."

Frank asked what was the reputation of the blacks for honesty and
in other ways.

"I'm sorry to say it is not of the best," was the reply. "Like most
savages, they show great readiness for acquiring the vices of civiliza--
tion, but great reluctance for adopting its virtues. They are adepts
at lying and stealing, though they are generally faithful to those Who
employ them as long as they are employed. They are like all other
savages,in their fondness for intoxicating liquors, and rarely miss an
opportunity for drinking. Most of those employed about the cattle
and sheep stations do not remain there long. As soon as they become
fairly useful they demand higher wages, and in a little while their
demands are so exorbitant that they must be sent away.

"When they are out of work they take to stealing cattle, and gen-
'erally from the station where they were formerly engaged, and with
which they are familiar. Many of them loaf around the towns, doing
small jobs of work, and generally dying of drink."

"Why don't they return to their tribes l" one of the youths in-
quired.

"For the very simple reason that they would be put to death by
their own people. A black who has been employed by a white man is
forever after an outcast from his own tribe; at least such is the case
with nearly all the tribes I ever heard of."

Frank asked Mr. Watson if he had been among the blacks and seen
them at home. The gentleman replied in the affirmative, and thenAMONG THE " BLACKFELLOWS." 351

both the youths askedhim to tell more about them and their ways of
living. Mr. Watson kindly assented, and at once began his story.

" At starting let me say," he remarked, " that the aborigines of Aus-
tralia are about the lowest type of the human race that can be found,
with the possible exception of ,the natives of Terra. del Fuego. They
belong distinctively to the black race, though their hair while curly has
not the woolly crispness of that of the African negro. In the interior,
away from settlements, they go entirely naked, and when white men
first came to Australia the natives had no knowledge of the uses of
clothing. Around the settlements they have adopted civilized customs
in the matter of dress, but only upon compulsion. I have known the

 

CIVILIZKD ABORIGINN.

blacks who were employed at a sheep-station to go naked when away
from the dwelling of their employer, and only resume their clothing on
returning to the house."
. "What kind of houses do they live in when by themselves 1" Frank
asked.
" They had not learned to build houses until the Europeans in-
structed them," was the reply, " and the wild tribes of the interior still
continue to live as they did of yore. They occasionally build rude huts
of bark by inclining two or three strips against each other in the form
of a cone, but more frequently their only protection against the weather
is a single strip of bark, or a large bough of a tree, inclined towards the
wind, and held in place by an upright stick.
" In my younger days I owned a station in a region Where the blacks
were numerous, and though they occasionally stole some of my sheep
and cattle, and committed other depredations, our relations were, on the
whole, of a friendly character. I allowed them to visit my house, but
only on condition that they were properly dressed, the dress consisting
of a skin or piece of cloth around the waist. As a single garment
lasted them a long time, it was
evident that they wore it only
when coming to my house, laying
it aside as soon as they were out
of sight. When going into battle
they paint their bodies with red
earth, to give them a hideous ap-
pearance, and if they can obtain
European paints of different col-
ors they are especially happy; they
imagine that the more hideously
they are decorated the more likely
are they to be victorious in fights
with other tribes.

"Like most other savage peo-
, ple, they obtain fire by rubbing

Allol'llGlNAL METHOD or mum: Hun. two sticks together; but the oper-

ation requires so much exertion
that they take great care to preserve fire when once they have obtained
it. A tribe will wander about for days and weeks carrying fire in coals
carefully protected by strips of bark; some of the old women are desig-
nated as fire-carriers, and are generally exempt from other work. When
they build fires at night they surround them with shields of bark, so
that their locality will not be revealed by the glare of light.

" They use columns of smoke by day, and fires by night, for convey-
ing intelligence. They have a very good telegraphic code by columns
of smoke, which can be made to indicate warnings, the position of game,
ships or whales in sight along the coast, and various other things. They
can make smoke signals that will be understood by their own or friend-
ly tribes, but be unintelligible to hostile ones. In former times they
used this smoke signal occasionally to the injury of the white settlers,
who had at first no idea that the thin column of smoke rising through

the trees was a signal for the warriors to make a. simultaneous attack
upon half a dozen places at once."ABORIGINAL WEAPONS. 353 '

Fred asked what kind of weapons they used in fighting with one
another or attacking the Europeans.

"Their principal weapon for close work," said Mr. Watson, "is the
waddy, or club. It is a heavy club made of hard-wood, and has a knob
at the end of the handle for greater security of grasp. Etiquette re
quires that blows with the 'waddy should be aimed only at the head;
to strike any other part of the body with it would not be fair. The
form of the weapon difiers with different tribes, so that it is possible
sometimes to learn to what tribe a party belongs by looking at their
clubs. Some tribes have wooden swords about three feet long, which
they handle very skilfully. '

 

AUSTRALIAN \VARRIORS WATCHING A BOAT.

" They are expert in throwing spears, which they launch very accu-
rately for distances of thirty or forty yards. Sometimes their spears
are a single piece of hard-wood tipped with bone, iron, or sharp stone;
other spears have heads of hard-wood, while the shaft is a light'reed
which grows abundantly on the banks of most of the rivers of Austra-
lia. The spears vary from six to eleven feet in length; I have seen
spears fifteen feet long, but they were intended for fishing, and not for
war, though they were often used for fighting purposes.

BATTLE BETWEEN llOG'l'ILB TRIBES OF AUSHIALIANS.

" A black in his wild state is rarely seen without a spear in his hand,
and this reminds me of one of my early experiences. I went out in the
bush one day with some of the friendly blacks, and had walked a short
distance in front of them when one of the party stopped me. He mo-
tioned for me to step to the rear, and then said,

"'When you walk in bush along a blaekfellow, you make him
blackfellow walk first time (in front).'

" When I asked what for, he replied, 'I den know. I believe debil
debil jump up; want him blackfellow spear whitefellow.' You can be
sure I took the hint, and ever afterwards allowed the blacks to take the
lead. Several times since then friendly natives have told me that when
a white man is walking in front of them there is an almost irresistible
inclination to spear him.

"They have a superstition which they express in these words:
'Blaekfellow die, jump up whitefellow ;' which means that when a

- black man dies he reappears as a White one. In the early (lays of the
settlement at Sydney, the convicts who ran away into the bush were
almost certain to be killed by the blacks if they escaped death by star-now A RUNAWAY convrcr BECAME A CHIEF. 355

vation before the blacks found them. One convict who thus escaped
wandered about for several days, and finally became so weak that he
could hardly stand. In this dilemma he took a, staff which he found
sticking in a mound of earth, and used it as a support. A few hours
afterwards he fell in with a party of natives, who treated him with
the greatest respect. They fed him bountifully, and nursed him as well
as their limited means permitted, and in course of time restored him
to health and strength. Every man indicated a desire to obey him.
He remained for years with the tribe, and as soon as he had acquired
enough of their language to communicate with them, they made him

understand that he was their chief.
"It turned out that the mound of earth where he found the staff

was the grave of their chief, who had recently (lied and been buried

 

ABORIGINAL AUS'I'RALIANS AND THEIR IIUTS.

there. The stick which he took from the mound was the shaft of the
chief's favorite spear, which was stuck into his grave according to their
custom. When he appeared leaning on the stick, the superstitions of -
the natives told them that he was their chief returned in the shape of a
white man. To this accidental circumstance he owed his life, as the
tribe was in the habit of spearing every white man who came in their
way."

Fred asked what were their burial customs, and if they had any
belief in a future existence.

" The dead are buried in the spots where they die, and these places
are never inhabited again by members of the dead man's tribe, nor are
they even visited except on rare occasions or from necessity. The
names of the dead are never pronounced, and those having the same
names are obliged to change them. My partner at the sheep-station
died of fever; he had been kind to the blacks, and was evidently liked
by them, but I could never get them to listen to any reference to him
after his (loath, and they did not like to look at his photograph, which
hung in the house.

"They have very crude ideas on religious matters. They believe in
good and bad spirits; and some tribes have a belief in a supreme being,
while others have none. They have many myths and superstitions, and
some of these myths display a vivid imagination on the part of those
who invented them. Shall I tell you some of them i"

The youths said they would greatly like to hear some of the Aus-
tralian myths, whereupon Mr. Watson continued:

" The aboriginal theory about the creation is that Pund~jel, or Bun-
jil, created two men out of the clay of the earth, but he did not create
women. That honor was reserved for Pal-ly-yau, the son of Pund--jcl,
who made a woman for each of the men. Pund-jel gave each man a
spear, and told him to kill the kangaroo with it; and to the women he
gave a digging-stick for digging roots from the ground. The men and
women were ordered to live together, and thus the world was peopled.
By-'md-by people became very numerous, and then Pund-jel caused
storms to arise, and winds to blow so severely as to scatter the people
over the earth, and thus the human race was dispersed.

"The first man and woman were told not to go near a certain tree
in which a bat lived, as he was not to be disturbed. One day the
woman, in gathering firewood, went near the tree; the bat flew away,
and after that came death."

" How closely it resembles the Biblical account of the fall of man!"
Fred remarked.

"The resemblance has been noticed by writers on the subject," said

. Mr. Watson, " and some believe that the tradition is not genuine. Mr.
Brough Smyth, author of an exhaustive work on the Aborigines of Vic-
toria, accepts it as genuine, and so do other prominent writers. I haveABORIGINAL SUPERSTITIONS. , 357

given some thought to the subject, and notwithstanding the similarity,
I agree with them.

" The blacks say there is a. very wicked man who has a. very long tail
living under the ground. He has many wives and children, and laughs
at the blacks because they have no tails. They have another tradition
that at one time there was no water anywhere on the earth, all the
waters being contained in the body of a huge frog, where men and
women could not get it. There was a grand council on the subject, and
it was ascertained that if the frog could be made to laugh, the waters
would run out of his mouth and the drought would be ended.

 

ABORIGINAL CHILDREN PLAYING IN HIS WATER.

" Several animals danced and capered before the frog to induce him
to laugh, but without success. Then the eel began to wriggle, and at
that the frog laughed outright; the waters ran from his mouth, and
there was a great flood, in which many people were drowned. The
pelican took it upon himself to save the black people. He cut an
immense canoe, and went with it among the islands which appeared
here and there above the waters, and with this canoe he saved a great
many men and women." ,

" A distinct tradition of the flood," remarked Fred to Frank, as Mr.
Watson paused a few moments to consider what he would next say.
" There is a myth about the sun that is quite interesting," Mr. Wat.
son continued. "They say that because the sun gives heat it needs 4
fuel, and when it descends below the horizon it goes down to a great
depth, where it is supplied with fuel. They have some knowledge of
astronomy, and have names for and traditions concerning the principal

 

THE "AUX? 0? 7m: nus-rm

planets and fixed stars. They have mythical snakes and other animals
possessing supernatural powers, and can tell you stories upon stories of
the wonderful things these creatures have done. The monster most
widely believed in is the bun-yip; he is of dreadful aspect, devours
great numbers of human beings, and altogether bears a. close resem-
blanoe to the dragons which were believed in in other parts of the
world at different times since the history of man began. He can cause
death, illness, disease, and other misfortunes, and is supposed to haunt
lakes, rivers, and water-holes all over the continent. Many natives
claim to have seen him, and a considerable number of white men eon-
firm their accounts of the creature."

"And do you think such an animal exists 2" Frank asked, with an
expression of astonishment.

" Of course not with the attributes the blacks give him," was the
reply, " but it is quite possible that Australia possesses an amphibious
animal which we have not yet been able to examine. As described by
those who claim to have seen the bun-yip, he resembles a seal or large
water-(log. The seal abounds in Australian waters; I presume that he
is the bun-yip of the natives, and that their imaginations have supplied
his wonderful powers."IN A COUNTRY HOTEL. 359

N their arrival at Roma, Doctor Bronson and his young compan-
ions spent the night, or what remained of it, in a hotel that was
anything but comfortable by comparison with the spacious caravan-
series of the city, but fully as good as they had expected to find in an
interior town. After an early breakfast they were taken in a light but
strong wagon, drawn by two powerful horses, to the station of their
host.

The road lay through an undulating country in which there was an
agreeable diversity of open areas interspersed with gum forest and
occasional scrub. The road was good for a track in the bush, but was

 

PETS AT THE NATION.

cut up with numerous gulh'es, ruts, and holes, which gave a liberal
amount of exercise to the occupants of the vehicle. Mr. Watson said it
was an excellent road in the dry season, but anything but agreeable
after heavy rains had converted it into a. long stretch of mud. "One
of my neighbms used to say," he continued, "that the road between
our houses was ten miles long, twenty feet wide, and two feet deep;
and he was not far from the mark."

We will let Frank tell the story of what they saw and heard at the
station; and we may add that where he found his memory at fault
while writing his account of the sheep and cattle raising business, he
refreshed it by glancing at several books on the subject, and particu-
larly at " Advance Australia!" by the Hon. Harold Finch-Hatton.

"We stopped several times on our way from Roma," said Frank in
his narrative, " as our host seemed to know everybody in the country,
and wished us to meet as many of his acquaintances as we could.
Every one was hospitable, and it was not easy to get away; partly for
this reason and partly in consequence of the distance, it was almost sun-
down when we reached the station, which was quite a village of houses.LIFE AMONG THE SQUA'I'TERS. 361

The principal house, where the owner and his family lived, was in an

- enclosure perhaps two hundred feet square. There were several trees
in the enclosure, and a perfect wilderness of vines and creepers of many
kinds. The vine most abundant was the scarlet geranium, which is
supposed to keep away snakes; but if half the stories we heard are
true, its virtue is not absolute in this respect.

" The house was a two-story building of wood, about fifty feet by
thirty, and stood upon posts, or piles, seven feet high, each post having
a geranium vine growing around it. There was a, wide veranda all
around the house; the space on the ground was occupied with dining
room, pantry, store-room, ofiice, and bath-room, and was easily accessible
on all sides. There was a. huge fireplace in the dining-room, and also
one in the large sitting-room directly above it. On the same floor with
the sitting-room there were four good bedrooms. One of these was
given to Doctor Bronson; the others being occupied by the family,
Fred and I were shown to a. small house just outside the yard, where
were two very good rooms, plainly but comfortably furnished. After
arranging our toilets we returned to the big house, and were ready for
dinner, which was shortly announced.

"We dined substantially on roast mutton, preceded by a soup of
kangaroo tail, and followed by a plum-pudding which had been put up
in London and sent to Australia in a. tin can. We spent an hour or two
in the sitting-room listening to tales of Australian bush life, and then
started for bed ; and thereby hangs a. tale.

 

Tl"; TIGER SNAKE.
"Fred's room was separated from mine by a thin partition. When
Mr. Watson left us Fred remarked that he was quite ready for a good
sleep, as he was very tired. As he spoke he turned down the bed-
clothes, and then shouted for me to come quick.

" ' Here's a big snake in my bed !' said he. ' Come and help me

' kill him.'

"Mr. Watson heard the remark, and hastened back before I could
get to where the snake was.

"'Don't harm that snake,' said he; 'it's a pet, and belongs to my
brother. It's nothing but a carpet snake.'

"With that Fred cooled down, but said he didn't want any such pet
in his bed, even if it was nothing but a carpet snake. The serpent,
which was fully ten feet long, raised his head lazily, and then put it
down again, as if he was quite satisfied with the situation and did not
wish to be disturbed.

"Mr. Watson explained that the snake had no business there, and
without more ado he picked the creature up by the neck and dragged it
off to a barrel which he said was its proper place. After he had gone
Fred and I put a. board over the top of the barrel to make sure that the
reptile did not give us a call during the night. Poverty is said to make
one acquainted with strange bedfellows, but poverty can't surpass Aus-
tralian bush life where a. man finds a snake in his bed altogether too
often for comfort.

"While we are on this subject," Frank continued, "we will have a
word about the snakes of Australia. The carpet snake, to which we
were so unceremoniously introduced, is the largest of the family, and is
really harmless, so far as its bite is concerned, though it has powers of
constriction that are not to be despised. It lives upon small game
which it can easily swallow, and occasionally ventures upon a young
wallaby or kangaroo. It may be kept as a pot, as you have seen; but
as it can't sing, doesn't learn tricks, never undertakes to talk, and does
nothing for the amusement or entertainment of its owner, 1 don't un<
derstand why anybody should want to pet it. But there's no account-
ing for tastes. It catches a few rats and other vermin, and occasionally
creates havoc in the chicken-yard.

" There are five deadly serpents in Australia--the black snake, the
brown snake, the tiger snake, the diamond snake, and the death-adder.
The black and brown are most common, and the brown snake frequent.
1y reaches a length of nine feet. The most vicious and dangerous is the
tiger snake, which seems to be allied to the cobra-de-capello of India, as,UNDEBWOOD'S CURE FOR SNAKE--sires. 363

when irritated, it flattens and extends its neck to twice its ordinary
size. It secretes its maximum amount of poison in the summer, and its
bite is speedily fatal. The bite of any of the snakes here enumerated
will cause death in a few hours unless the proper antidotes are ap-
plied.

" The death-adder is unlike the other snakes in one respect; it never
attempts to get out of any one's way, but lies quite still until it is
touched, when it instantly strikes at its victim. The best-known rein-
edies for snake-bites are hypodermic injections of ammonia, cutting out
the wound, and swallowing large quantities of brandy orlother spirits.

 

CAMPING-OUT ON A CA'H'LE'BUN.

"' Mr. Watson says there was once a man named Underwood, who
discovered a perfectly efficacious antidote to the bite of a poisonous
snake. He gave several performances in which he allowed himself to
be bitten by snakes that were undoubtedly healthy and in full posses-
sion of their venomous powers. Dogs and rabbits that were bitten by '
the same snakes after they had tried their fangs on Underwood died
very soon afterwards; and it must be remembered that the second bite
of a. snake is always less poisonous than the first. After being bitten
by the snakes, Underwood applied a remedy which was known only to
himself, and soon recovered from the elfects of the bite.

" The manner of his death is a very convincing proof of the perfec-
tion of his remedy. One day, while under the influence of liquor, he
allowed himself to be bitten by a. snake; in consequence of his intoxi-
cation he was unable to find his antidote, and so he died of the bite.
His secret perished with him; he had demanded PS10,000 ($50,000) for
it, which the Government refused to pay, as they thought the price
exorbitant.

"Every new chum--freshly arrived men in the colonies are known
as 'new chums'--ha,s a nervous apprehension about snakes when he
first sets foot in the bush, and has quite likely provided himself with a.
pair of long boots as a. protection against venomous reptiles. Within a
week or so this feeling wears off, and after a while a man thinks no
more about snakes than in England or the United States. Most of the
deaths from snakebites occur among the laborers in the fields, and alto-
gether they are by no means uncommon. In some localities one might
go about for years without seeing a snake, while in others the deadly
reptiles are so numerous that caution must be exercised. 'The worst
regions are said to be the cane-fields of the Mackay district and the
reed-beds on the Murray River.

" There are centipedes and scorpions in Australia whose bite is poi--
sonous, and there is a black spider about the size of a. large pea, with a
brilliant crimson mark on its back. It lives in old timber, and fre-
quently takes up its abode
in a house, where it does
not wait to be disturbed
before attacking one. Its
bite is very painful; death
not infrequently follows it,
but more probably the vic-
tim becomes hopelessly in-

soft, like dough. The wound turned into a running sore, which did not
heal for months.

"We thought we were going to sleep well at the station, but soon
found our mistake. We were not far from a pen where a dozen wean-
ling calves were shut to separate them from their mothers. The calves
kept up .31 steady bleating, and their
mothers in the paddock close by plain-
tively answered them. About the same
distance off on the other side was, the
chicken-house, and we had the benefit
of the voices of the chanticleers. Cocks
in Australia begin to crow at mid-
night and stop at sunrise. They must
have had a clock to look at, as the
first of them crowed exactly at twelve,
and the others followed without a
minute's delay. Then a flock of ducks
added their clamor; and the fun was
liveliest when a dingo, or wild dog, set
up a howl in the bush. This started
all the canines on the place,vand as
Mr. Watson and his brother were the
owners of four bull-dogs, six fox-ter- m: rnosrxnofls scum-m
riers, three cattledogs, four kangaroo-
dogs, and two wolf-hounds, I leave you to imagine the sounds that
greeted our ears.

" One gets used to this sort of thing, like everything else, and on
the second night on the place we slept without much interruption; but
on that first morning we were glad when daylight came, so that we
could get up; and when we saw the beauty of the breaking day we
were very glad we had risen so early. There was a peculiar freshness
about the air, and the scent of the gum-trees was clearly perceptible.
Over the low ground there lay a thin mist, which the rising sun dis-
pelled, and then as the sunlight came breaking over the landscape it
bathed the whole scene in an atmosphere of gold. Ducks flapped their
wings over the surface of a pond a few hundred yards away; crows
sailed around in the air or perched on trees not far from the dwell-
ing-house, and two or three other birds added their notes to the
chorus. Chickens, pigeons, and other domestic birds gathered in front
of the storehouse, waiting for their morning meal; cows were low-

ing and horses neighing in the
yards, and everything betokened
activity.

"We went in the direction of
the yards, and as we did so a black
boy came dashing up behind a
drove of thirty or forty horses
which he had brought in from the
great paddock. They were intend--
ed for the day's riding, and one of
the men about the place told us
that it is the custom on an Austra
lian station to bring up the horses
every morning in this way, and
turn them out again after the se-
lections for the day have been
made.

"The stock-keepers were on hand to pick out their horses, and we
watched the work with a good deal of interest. Australian horses have
a bad reputation, and as we saw the men going into the yard we felt
sure there would be a. lively time; but, contrary to our cJ'rpectations,
the animals quietly submitted, and were saddled and bridled without
the least resistance. The horses are cunning creatures and know their
masters, so that when an old hand approaches them they thoroughly
understand the folly of resistance, as it is sure to bring punishment.

" It was very difierent the next
morning when a new chum went
in to catch a horse. With the aid
of a black boy he cornered it off in

the yard, and then, with the bridle _

over his arm, approached it slowly
and with soothing words, which
might as well have been addressed
to a grisly bear. Australian horses
are cruelly treated all their lives,
and consequently they nearly all
have vicious tempers, on which
kindness is wholly thrown away.
The horse immediately understood
the man to be a stranger in the

 

PERFORMANCE OF A BECKER.HOW A NEW CHUM CATCHES A HORSE. 367

country, and proceeded to act accordingly. The expression of his eye
and the droop of his quarters were not to be misunderstood; and just
as the man put out his hand with the bridle, the horse gave a snort and
a rush, knocking down his would-be captor, and then galloped round
and round the yard with his tail in the air.

" Again the man got the horse in a corner, and just as he was about
getting the bridle into place the brute put his head over the fence,
where it could not possibly be reached, and at the same time spitefully
threw 'his heels in the air in a way that made the new chum look out
for his safety. Three or four other attempts were made, to the great
delight of the old hands, who always sit on the fence and watch the
performance until they grow weary of laughing; then they come to
the relief of the novice, and saddle and bridle the horse for him at once.

 

THE MllKlNG-YARD.

"After the horse had been saddled the new chum tried to mount
him. He got safely into the saddle, but hardly was he seated before
the beast began to 'buck,' as we call it in America, or 'buck-jump,' as
it is designated here. The horse brought his head and all his feet
together, arched his back till it resembled a section of the dome of a
church, and then jumped up, down, sidewise, forward, backward, and in
every other. direction in very rapid succession. The man was a good
rider, and managed to stick until the horse lay down and tried to roll
over him, when he slid out of the saddle and gave up.

"Then one of the old hands tried the horse, which repeated the
performance, but not so successfully, as the rider suddenly pulled the

animal's head up and prevented his falling to the ground. Praetised
riders sometimes show their skill by putting a silver coin the size of a.
half-dollar between each thigh and the saddle, and retaining it there
in spite of all the plunging and bucking of the animal.* One of the
men gravely told us he had seen a, man thrown twenty feet into the
air by a bucking horse, and then come down astride the saddle in exact-
ly the right position. Another said he had seen a. horse swell himself
suddenly, so as to burst the girths of the saddle; the saddle and the
man on it then went fully ten feet into the air, and came down on the
horse all right and in order. We had intended to tell them about the
remarkable riding of Buffalo Bill and his cow-boys, but after these two
stories we had nothing to say.

 

* In an article on "Ranch Life in the Far West," in The Contmy Magazine for Feb-
ruary,1888, Hon. Theodore Roosevelt snys: "The flash-riders. or horse-breakers, always
called 'bronchorhusters,' can perform really marvellous fonts, riding with ease the most
vicious and unbroken beasts, thnt no ordinnry cow'boy would dare to tackle. Although
sitting seemingly so loose in the saddle, such It rider cannot be jarred out of it by the
wildest plunger, it being a favorite feat to sit out the antics of a bucking horse, with a
silver half-dollar under ouch knee or in the stirrups under each foot."ENDURANCE OF AUSTRALIAN HORSES. 369

" Australian horses are credited with remarkable endurance. A ride
of a. hundred miles between sunrise and sundown is not a wonderful
performance. There is a story of a man who rode a pony a hundred
miles in a day, and then carried it a. hundred yards; but it is proper to
add that the pony died from his rough usage. One horse carried his
rider, a Mr. Lord, two hundred and sixty-three miles in three days, and
suffered no ill effects from doing so. The distances made were eighty-
eight inilcs the first day, eighty-three the second, and ninety-two on
the third. Mr. Lord weighed one hundred and ninety-nine pounds, so
that the horse had no feather-weight to carry. .

"We were called away to breakfast before the men had finished
their work with the horses, as some were to be reserved for the use
of the strangers. Mr. Watson had given orders that the best horses

were to be turned over to us; not the best from the stoekman's point
of view, but those of the kindest disposition and least addicted to tricks.
A horse without any bad tricks is not easy to find on an Australian
station; if what we were told about their breaking is true, it is no
wonder.

24
" There are men who go about breaking horses for eight or ten dol-
lars a head. They are regular cow-boys, who cannot be thrown out of
a saddle by any motions the horse may make short of lying down and

rolling over them. A lot of young
horses which have never been in a.
yard twice in their lives are driven
up into an enclosure; a. horse is

selected, separated from the herd,

and driven into a smell yard by
himself. He is lassoed or secured
in some way, and a. saddle and bri-
dle are put on him. While the an-
imal is held by his assistants, the
horse-breaker mounts, and then
sticks his spurs into the poor beast
and sets him to bucking till he is
tired out and gives in; then the
horse is left for a few hours with
the saddle on. After two or three
days of this kind of treatment he
is turned over to his owner as
' broken.'

" The Australian saddle is very
much like the Mexican, or like that
used in the Western States of North
America. and on the frontier. It
has a high pommel and cantle,
weighs not far from twenty pounds,
and is used with a. saddle-cloth be--
neath it, the same as the Whitman
and other well-known saddles of
American make. Some riders pre-
fer English saddles, but they are
useless for bucking hor.ses A gen--
tleman who has had a. great deal

of experience in Australia says he has seen men ride very bad buck-
jumpers barebacked and has often lied/ml of men who could ride them
in am English saddle, but he never saw it done, and does not believe

such a thing possible.

" For breakfast we had broiled steak, with fried eggs and bacon,HOW THEY LIVE in THE BUSH. 371

plenty of good bread, some pickles and jam, washed down with strong
tea. Coffee is not often used in the Australian bush, the greater con-
venience of tea having made it much more popular. Living in the bush
is not luxurious, and on many stations the unvarying round of tea,
damper, and beef or mutton soon becomes monotonous. These are the
staples of food; vegetables of any kind are rarely seen; and as for
pickles, jam, and the like, they are luxuries which only the prosperous
can afford. ' Damper' is dough baked in hot ashes or on a hot stone;
when you are hungry and the damper is fresh, it is by no means un--
palatable; but cold damper requires an excellent appetite to get it down.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A NEW enun's rum- mus.

"Soon after breakfast the horses were brought up, and we started,
under the guidance of Mr. Watson, for a ride among the cattle, The
run, as a cattle or sheep range is called (the Word corresponding in
usage to the American 'rauch'), was about twenty miles square, and
was said to be an excellent one, as the grass was good and there was
plenty of water. Cattle and sheep runs are frequently much larger _
than this; I heard of some that covered areas of more than six hun-
dred square miles, and were capable of carrying thirty thousand head
of cattle; but such runs are becoming more and more rare every year.
" The large runs have two or three, and sometimes more, stations, or
residences, with yards and buildings ;. One of them is the 'head station,'
where the owner or manager lives, and from which orders are sent out.

 

A STAMPKDE.

Each station has from one to three or four stockmen, with as many

~black assistants; this force is sufficient for managing the cattle; and
each station has its herd of horses, which are driven up every morning,
as already described. The horses are in a paddock, or fenced pasture,
but the cattle roam at large and are generally about half wild. Some
of the runs have boundary fences; but this is by no means the rule, and
the consequence is that cattle of different owners are constantly mixed
up and require separating.

" All over the runs there are cattlecznnps at intervals of a. few miles;
these are level places, free from stones, and with plenty of water, and
it is part of the stockman's work to accustom the cattle to run to these
camps whenever they hear the crack of his whip. Driving into camp
is called tailing, or mustering, and we were bound on a mustering expe-
dition to a. camp five or six miles away. The object of the muster wasMUSTERING CATTLE ON A "CAMP." 373

to draft some bullocks to sell to a. cattle-dealer who arrived at the star
tion about the time we did.

" Two of the stockmen had been sent off very early in the morning
to work the other side of the camp; we jogged on at an easy pace
through alternating forest and open ground, where sometimes we could
not see half a. mile in any direction, and again coming out to ridges
where we had an extensive view. We had gone about three miles when

 

A FREE SELECTOR AT HOME.

suddenly we came upon a. mob of some fifty or sixty cattle that went
oif in the right direction as soon as they heard the cracking of the
'whips. Mr. Watson said they would go straight to the camp, and Fred
and I might follow them, which we did. Sure enough, they took us
right where we wished to go; and when we reached the camp we saw
fully five hundred cattle gathered there in charge of the two stockmen
from the other side.

 

ARRIVAL 0? THE WEEKLY MAIL.

"The rest of the party had turned 01f to the right as soon as our
'mob of cattle started, and didn't come up to us until we had been fully
half an hour on the ground. They were preceded by three or four
mobs of cattle that came dashing in with tails in the air, and acting as
though they enjoyed the sport.

" The camp was a picturesque sight. The stocklnen and the black
boys were riding constantly around the herd, to keep the animals from
straying or breaking away; the cattle were moving restlessly about,
the cows lowing for their missing calves, the bullocks indulging in an
occasional fight, in which none of them was hurt, and the Whole herd
separating occasionally into little groups composed of those that had
been accustomed to run together on the pastures. The camp was par-
tially covered with a. very thin forest of iron-bark trees, and the white,
red, and roan colors of the animals made a. very pretty contrast against
the black tinge of the wood and the green of the grass.EXPLANATION OF AUSTRALIAN COLLOQUIALISMS. 375

"We dismounted, and sat down on a. log, while the stockmen and
the cattledealer proceeded to draft out the animals that were wanted.
I may as well explain some of the terms used here, as they will doubt-
less seem strange in America.

"A 'mob' is a bunch or group of cattle that have assembled for
grazing purposes. A herd consists of several or many mobs.

" ' Tailing' is the assembling of one or a few mobs at the stock--yards
or cattlecamps; tailing is sometimes called mustering, but the latter
term applies more particularly to the annual or semi-annual assemblage
of all the cattle belonging to a run for the purpose of counting, brand-
ing, and other operations to which cattle are devoted. The muster is
exactly analogous to the American ' round-up.'

"Unruly cattle in Australia. are termed 'rowdy ;' 'drafting' is the
process of selecting animals from the herds, and when they are rowdy,
as they generally are, the performance is by no means free from dan-
ger. Not infrequently drafting is called 'cutting out.'

 

" curl-me our."

"The word 'squatter' in Australia has a, meaning almost the re-
verse of its American one. In America a. squatter is the occupant of a.
small area of land on which he has ' squatted,' or settled, with a view to
acquiring title under the homestead laws, 'or perhaps to being bought
ofi' by somebody else. In Australia the squatter is the holder of a run
which he obtains by lease from the Government for a term of years,
paying an annual rental of ten shillings per square mile, with a privilege
of renewal, and also with the right of preemption or actual purchase.

"What we call a squatter in America is here a 'free selector ;' he
has the privilege of selecting land not already occupied for agricultural
purposes, and between the squatters and the free selectors there is a
feeling of great hostility. The laws of the colony have been subject to
a great deal of change in the last twenty years; the squatters feel that
they have been unfairly treated, and we heard many stories of down-
right hardship. .

"Into this question of the rights of land--owners in Australia we will
not enter, as the discussion would be an interminable one. More inter-
esting to the boys at home will be the performance of drafting cattle
from the herd.

"A small mob of cattle was separated from the herd and driven
away a little distance to serve as the nucleus of the draft-mob. Then
the cattle-dealer and two of the stockmen rode into the herd and se-
lected the animals they wanted; each man was mounted on a good
'camp-horse,' one used to cutting out cattle, and it was interesting to
see the intelligence of the horses in-their work. The men selected the
bullocks they wanted, and then edged them out in the direction of the
draft-mob; most of the bullocks were rowdy, and gave the men a liver
chase before theysubmitted to be separated from their fellows.

"The horse followed the bullock wherever he went, as though the
latter was leading him. Over rocks, fallen trees, and among upright
ones went the bullocks, with men and horses after them, and it was a.
wonder that none of the men had their necks broken in the chase. Ac
cidents do happen, however, and sometimes they are fatal; one occurred
at this very place a few months ago, a stockman being killed by his
horse falling and then rolling over him. He was a graduate of Cam-
bridge College, in England, the son of a. gentleman of good position but
small fortune, and had come to Australia to make his way in the world.

"In speaking of this incident Mr. Watson said that a considerable
proportion of the stockmen in Australia were men of education and of
good families, who had come to the new country because it afforded
better means of advancement than they could hope for at home. It is
no disgrace in Australia for a man to work with his hands for an hon-
est living. any more than it is in the new States and Territories of theSCENES 0F QUEENSLAND LIFE. 317

" The Premier of one of the colonies--the Premier is equivalent to

benefited by so doing. It appears to be the antipodes of England in
many social customs, just as it is in geographical position and many of
its natural features.

"While we were seated on the log, watching the drafting opera-
tions, Fred asked Mr. Watson about the daily life of the stockmen on
a cattle-run.

" Mr. Watson answered that it was active enough, and no man who
engaged in the business need have a bad digestion. The stockman gets
his breakfast early in the morning, and immediately after breakfast the
horses are brought up. Then he starts out over that part of the run
which is assigned to him; he jogs along about five miles an hour, accus-
toming the cattle to the sight of men, keeping his own mobs inside the
boundaries and driving back those of his neighbors, hunting up stray
calves, and bringing them home and branding them, and occasionally
driving the cattle to the camps, so that they will know what is expected
of them when they hear the cracking of the whip.SOLITARY DEATHS 1N "THE BUSH." 379

"Sometimes the man is accompanied by a. black boy, but quite as
frequently he goes alone. ' Really it ought to be the rule for a. stock-
man never to go out alone,' said Mr. Watson, 'as there are so many
dangers connected with bush--riding, and on my run I insist upon it.

" 'Many accidents have happened, and the history of the colonies is
full of melancholy stories about men who fell and were crippled away
from home, and died in consequence. Many a. men has disappeared,
and no trace of him has ever been found; in other casw bleaching skele-
tons have been discovered years later, and the few who have not for-
gotten the missing men will connect these skeletons with their fate.

 

mun Anoxn IN "ms BUSH."

" ' There was a. horrible case,' said Mr. Watson, ' that is fresh in the
memory of many men. A man wasriding alone in the bush, when his
horse threw him and injured his spine in such a way that he could not
move. Close to Where he fell was an enormous ants' nest, and when
the man was found, three days after the accident, he was still alive and
conscious, but unable to speak, his body having been half devoured by
the ants. He died a, few hours after, and it is awful to think of what
his sufferings must have been.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

" ' A parallel to this terrible story is found in the fate of a. woodman
who was felling trees in the forest several miles from any one else. A
burning tree fell on him and pinned him to the ground, but without
doing him any serious injury. He was unable to extricate himself, and
for the day and a half it took for the fire to smoulcler slowly to him heCHASING AN EMU. 381

was fully aware of his impending fate. He scratched an account of the
occurrence on a tin dish that lay within his reach; when he was found
his body was so charred and blackened that it would not have been
recognized as the remains of a man had it not been for the tin dish that
told the horrible story. The tree which fell on him was of a. kind that
has the peculiarity of smouldering slowly and leaving nothing but a
track of white ashes on the ground.'

" Each of us had brought his dinner, tied at the back of his saddle;
and after looking on a while at the drafting, we went to a spring near
by and heartily enjoyed our meal. It consisted simply of beef and
bread, and was eaten from the fingers in a very primitive way. Soon
after dinner we rode back to the station, leaving the stockmen and their
assistants to bring up the drafted animals, while the rest were let loose

again.
" On our return we saw a young emu, the famous bird that is some-

times called the Australian ostrich. Fred and I started after him, but
we might as well have tried to run down a railway-train; he left us
out of sight in less than ten minutes, although we were on fairly good
horses. Mr. Watson said the speed and endurance of these birds was
really wonderful; he had often tried to run them down, but had only
succeeded in a single instance, and that by a sudden spurt when the
bird was frightened. Hunters on fleet horses sometimes run down
these birds, and they can also be overtaken by swiftfooted dogs.

"He said the funny thing was that the emu struggles along as
though just ready to drop dead with exhaustion, keeping not far from
ten yards in front of the horse, and regulating his speed according to
that of his pursuer. Doctor Bronson said'he was like the jack-rabbit
of our Western plains, that will keep about the same distance in front
of a dog, no matter how fast the latter may run.

" The bones of the emu contain an oil which is used by the natives
for curing sprained sinews and swollen joints. It has remarkable quali-
ties, as it is said to sweat through the side of a glass bottle; the natives
believe that if applied to the joints of a person who has not reached
maturity, it will soften the bones and render them brittle.

" Soon after losing sight of the emu we roused up a flock of wild
turkeys; one of the stockmen carried a gun, and by circling in the
direction of the birds he get near enough to bring down two of them.
They are very shy of persons on foot, but can be approached on horse-
back with comparative ease."

N their search for knowledge Frank and Fred made many inquiries
relative to the profits of cattleraising in Australia, and the chances
of making a. fortune at it in a given number of years. Here is a. su1n~
mary of what they ascertained:
The part of Queensland bor-
dering the coast is not suited for
sheep, owing to a. peculiar grass
which grows there. It has a
seed with a. barb at the end, and
this barb enables it to' work its
way into any soft substance; the
wool of the sheep becomes so
full of this seed that it is abso-
lutely worthless, and after a time
the seeds work their way into the
flesh of the unfortunate animal
until they kill him. A man rid-
ing or walking in this grass when
it is ripe gets his clothing full of
the seed, and is very apt to lose
ms mm: or Tux sn-nos. his temper, from the continua-IPROFITS or CATTLE--RAISING. 383

pricking of the sharp points. Sheep cannot live in this region, but the
seeds do not affect cattle, which thrive on the grass. In the interior
the obnoxious grass does not exist, and consequently it may be roundly
stated that all parts of Queensland are suitable for grazing cattle, but
onlythe interior is adapted to sheep.

Cattleraising is less profitable than raising sheep, but it does not
require as much capital, and is less risky. A cattle-run may be made
to pay from the start, while a sheep-station requires a. heavy outlay be-
fore any returns can be received.

Mr. Watson said that five thousand cattle could be put on an unim-
proved run for about one hundred thousand dollars; the necessary build- '
ings, yards, weaning-paddock, horse--paddock, and other enclosures Would
cost three thousand dollars, while two thousand dollars would pay all
the wages of employes, and for the food and equipment of everybody at-
tached to the place, for a year. For the first five years only fat cattle
should be sold, and these would be enough to pay working expenses, in
addition to improvements in the way of boundary and other fences.

 

11m sounrnn's rm.

At the end of five years there would be ten thousand cattle on the
run, and after making liberal allowances for expenses from that time,
the annual increase would be two thousand five hundred, of which fully
eight hundred would be fat cattle. The sale of the increase would're-
turn from twenty-eight to thirty thousand dollars annually; and after
deducting liberally for working expenses, the yearly profit could be put

down at twenty thousand dollars. Meantime the run has doubled in
value, and the investment is paying handsomely.

This is the bright side of the picture. The dark side contains
epidemics of pleuropneumonia, which has been the ruin of squatters
on more than one occasion; added to this is the danger of a, severe
drought, in which thousands of cattle die of thirst and the inability to
get food in consequence of the drying up of the grass. In some years
millions of cattle and sheep have perished in this. way, and hundreds
of owners were ruined. . .

"Compared with sheep-raising," said Mr. Watson, "the cattle busi-
ness will return a. high interest on the capital invested if properly man-
aged and fairly successful, but does not afford the rapid road to wealth
that many have travelled by a few successful years with sheep. Cattle
require few men to manage them, and entail no great expense before
they are sold and the money is obtained for them. A cattle--station has
rarely an occasion to ask the banks for loans, While the sheep-raiser con-
stantly requires money to pay for shepherds, shearers, and other labor-
ers, and is under heavy expense for the carriage of his wool to the sea,-
ports.

"It is safe to say," he continued, "that the palmy days of sheep and
cattle raising are gone forever. There is very little country suitable for
grazing purposes that is not already taken up, and the holders want

go into the interior, find a good location for a. run, enter it for lease,
and then obtain a partner with the capital necessary for stocking it
with a few thousand sheep. With half a dozen good seasons they
would make their fortunes, partly from the sale of wool and the increase
of stock, and partly from the rise in the value of the lease, but at the,
same time they might be ruined by two bad seasons of drought, disease
among the sheep, or by the low price of wool."
25
Frank asked what was the nature of the droughts of which Mr.
Watson had spoken.

"In a general way, they are like droughts anywhere else," was the
reply; "but they have some features peculiar to Australia. In 1883
and 1884 we had two successive years of drought, a thing never known
before. Very little rain fell in all that time, and in some localities not
a drop; the grass withered, water-holes, springs, and creeks that for years
had been unfailing sources of supply dried up, and the whole country
was desolate. There were single areas hundreds of miles in extent
where not a. drop of natural water could be found, and the sheep and
cattle perished in great numbers. Experience has shown that every-
part of Australia capable of producing sheep is subject to occasional
periods of unusual drought, and nobody can foretell them. There is
only one way of guarding against their effects."

"What is that 'l"

"Build reservoirs, and store water in sufiicient quantities to last
through the severest droughts. Of course this will cost money, but it
will be a profitable investment in the long run. Many squatters are
now doing this, and they are also putting down. driven wells after the
system invented in America about 1860. It is probable that the next
long-continued drought will not cause the death of so many sheep as
did that of 1883 and 1884. The loss of sheep in Queensland in those
two years was nearly three millions."

Fred asked how many sheep, cattle, and horses there were in the
colony.

" According to the official figures," Mr. Watson replied, " we had at
the last reports (December, 1885), 260,207 horses, 4,162,652 cattle, and
8,994,322 sheep. Compare these figures with those of 1844, when we
had 660 horses, 13,295 cattle, and 184,651 sheep. We had more than
12,000,000 sheep in Queensland at the end of 1882, and will doubtless
reach that number again with a single prosperous season. Sheep in-
crease more rapidly than cattle, as you are doubtless aware, provided
the flocks do not suifer'from distemper, drought, severe storms, or other
drawbacks. According to the official figures, we have 75,000,000 sheep
in Australia, or more than twice as many as you have in the United
States."

At the end of the visit to the cattle-station Doctor Bronson and the
youths returned to the railway, and proceeded to a sheep--station in
which their polite and hospitable entertainer was interested. We have
already described sheep-farming in New Zealand, and as the business is

much the same in Australia, the visit was not altogether full of nov-
elty.

But our friends ascertained that one important difference between
sheep-farming in the two countries was in the matter of snowstorms.
We have seen how the New Zealand flocks sufl'er from heavy falls of
snow; in Queensland there is no such hinderance, the sheep remaining
out-of-(loors the entire year, and
needing no protection other than
the yards into which they are
driven at night or when wanted
for shearing or selection. .

An Australian sheep- station
consists of two yards built of logs,
brush-wood, or small saplings.
Each yard must be large enough
to contain fifteen hundred sheep;
and there is a small but for two
men to sleep in at night. These

A snuuxnn's Doc. - stations are scattered over the run

at distances of two or three miles

from one another, and there is a head, or central, station, where the

squatter or his manager lives, and whence the supplies for the men

are sent out. According to the size of the run and the number of sheep

upon it will the stations be multiplied. The run our friends were vis-

iting had twelve stations altogether, the newest being one mile from
the head station, and the farthest fourteen miles.

In reply to his' inquiry as to the duties of a shepherd, Frank learned
the following, which he carefully noted:

" A good shepherd will let his flock out of the yard soon after sun-
rise and before the heat is uncomfortable, and allow them to spread out
as far as can be done with safety. With the aid of his dogs he heads
them towards water, and allows them to feed so as to reach the drink-
ing-place about noon; then he turns them around and feeds them slowly
back again, so as to get to the yards just at sunset. This is the routine
day after day, with slight variations when the sheep are mustered for
selection, which is not very often. Sunday is the same as any other day
on a sheepstation, as the animals must be pastured exactly as on week.
days, and there 1s no relay of shepherds."

" It must be a terribly monotonous life," Frank remarked.

"It is indeed," was the reply. " The two men at a station are sep~

arated during the day, as they feed their flocks in different directions,
and at night they are too tired to do much talking, and very often are
not on speaking terms. They become moody and taciturn; and it is a.
sad fact that three-fourths of the occupants of insane asylums in Aus-
tralia, are shepherds.

pects for the future. I have often wondered how it was possible for us .
to procure shepherds, when the future has so few inducements for them;
but somehow we always manage to find enough of them. Many men
come here with bright hopes, but they soon tire of the work; if they
have money enough to get away, they generally do so at the end of a.
few months. .
"The new chums that engage as shepherds are always put at the
most disagreeable work, that of looking after diseased sheep, if there
are any on the station. If you want to see what it is, reed Mr. Eden's
book, ' My Wife and I in Queensland,' and learn what he went through
when he came to the colony. He engaged as a. shepherd, and was as

signed to look after sheep affected with the footrot. Every morning
each animal had to be caught, its hoofs pared, and a dressing applied of
a peculiar ointment that burned a hole in the operator's clothing if any
fell upon it. He and another man had seven hundred sheep to look
after, and each animal had to be lifted bodily over a fence, and held
down by main force during the operation. When this was completed
the flock had to be fed; and if any sheep died While they were out in
pasture the men brought in the skins, or the value of the animals was
deducted from their wages. No wonder he left the place at the end of
two months, and walked back to Brisbane."

Fred remarked that they must have a very busy time of it at the
sheepstations during the shearing season.

" It is the busiest time of the year," said Mr. Watson, " and one that
taxes all our abilities. The sheep are driven to the wool-shed, which is
a large quadrangular building, varying in size according to the capabili-
ties of the station and the extent of its working force. Walk out with
me and look at ours, which is accounted a good one."

The boys were interested in the building, and especially so as Mr.
Watson explained its peculiarities and uses.

"You observe," said he, "that there is a bulkhead running across
the middle of the building, dividing it into two parts, one of which
is intended for sheep, and when full holds about five hundred. This
smaller enclosure opens out from the larger one, and is always kept
full, so that a shearer can lay his hands on a sheep at once without the
necessity of chasing it. This plank floor on each side of the small
enclosure is for the shearers, and there is a small door abreast of where
each man stands. He lets his sheep out of that door after they have
been sheared; and there is a small yard outside each door, where they
remain, so that they can be counted by the manager, and thus all dis--
putes avoided.

"The shearer drags a sheep from the pen, and places it between his
knees with its head uppermost; he always stands when at work, and
for a novice it is very wearying till he gets used to it. He shears from
the throat downward, leaving the back to the last, when the fleece falls
off in one piece."

" Do the men ever cut the sheep while shearing l" Fred asked.

"Yes, very often," was the response; "and some men 'tomahawk'
a great deal worse than others, and never seem to improve. When this
happens the shearer does not stop an instant; he calls out 'tar l' and the
man or boy whose duty it is to gather up the fleeces rushes to the spotSHEEP--SHEARERS AND THEIR WORK. 393

with a tar-bucket and brush, and covers the wound with tar to keep
away the flies. The sheep do not struggle, no' matter how badly they
are hurt, and are literally ' dumb before the shearers.' "

" How many sheep can a good operator shear in a day t"

" The number varies according to skill and experience," said Mr.
Watson. " The men are paid an agreed price per score--usually five
shillings, or four sheep for a. shilling. I have known men who could
shear sixscore, or oneihundred and twenty sheep, in a day, but under
ordinary circumstances it takes a good shearer to do fourscore. In addi-
tion to their pay, the squatter must feed them; in rainy weather all
work ceases, as the wool cannot be packed when we ."

" Where do the shearers come from ?"

" That's a hard question to answer. They follow other occupations
except at shearing-time, when they form themselves into gangs and
travel about the country; they are usually well mounted, and generally

8. gang carries its own cook, and is very particular about its way of liv-
ing. The squatters find it to their advantage to feed the shearers liber-
ally, and I have known one who hired a fiddler to play all day in the
shed, to keep the men in good-humor. Most of these fellows are gam-
blers, and generally by the end of their season a few skilful players
among them have all the money earned by the entire gang.

"After the wool is sheared it is packed into bales and pressed hard
by means of machinery almost identical with a cotton-press. In this
condition it is sent to the coast, and shipped to England or whatever
market is open for it. High prices for wool make good profits for the
squatters, and low prices the reverse, just as is the case in business gen-
erally. Many squatters have their entire crop of wool mortgaged to the
bankers who have made advances upon it; in this respect sheep-stations
are more desirable than cattlestations, as money can always be had in
advance upon the crop of woo ."

Some of the large establishments have adopted improved methods
of washing sheep; our friends had an opportunity to inspect one of
them; during the inspection Frank made a drawing of the washing ap-
paratus, to which he appended the following description:

"A represents a twenty-horsepower engine working a sixteen-inch pump, B, which
raises water from the river alongside, discharging about three thousand gallons per minute
into spouting tank, 0 (half of which is cut OR in the drawing to show the work behind).
The tank is of iron, four feet deep, furnished with a spout four feet six inches deep, termi-
nnting in a narrow opening three feet long and three-sixteenths or one-quarter inch wide.
the width being regulated by screws.

" Through this aperture the water, under the pressure of eight feet six inches, rushes
with great force. E e s is an iron tub in which the ' spouter' stands while holding the
sheep under the spout. F is an inclined plane, up which the sheep walk after emerging
from the water, passing on to large batten yards, one hundred and fifty feet by one hun-
dred feet, where they remain till partially dry. These yards are not shown in the draw.
ing. 6 is another ten-horsepower engine, used for cutting firewood at the circularssw
bench, h, and to furnish steam to heat water in the soaking tank, 1', and the ten square
tanks, k, ranged along either side of the soaking tank.

" To each of these tanks is fitted a branch steam-pipe, 1n. communicating with the
main steamspipe, 7t 11, leading from the boilers of both engines, A and G, so that both are
available for heating water, of which a very large quantity, varying from seven thousand
to ten thousand gallons, is required for a single day's work. 0 a a are water-pipes leading
from the spouting tank, 0', to supply the square tanks, 1:, the soupJubs, P and Q, and

pump by branch pipes, which is often necessary, and for various other purposes.

" The receiving yards having been filled with sheep, the water in, and the tanks

Frank and Fred learned many other things about sheep-farming in
Australia, but they made no further notes on the subject, and there-
fore we will drop it. At any rate, they did not conclude to go into the
business when they learned of its hazards and discomforts, and ascer-
tained from the newspapers that the price of wool was at that time
quite low.

Frank made a memorandum of a good story that he heard during
the evening, while they sat in front of the fire in the sitting-room of the
head station. It was told by the manager of the place, and was as
follows:

"When I first came to Australia," said the manager, "I was em-
ployed on a cattle-station in Victoria; while I was there gold was dis-
covered about ten miles away from us. The rush to the mines caused a
demand for our cattle, and the owner did a fine business in supplying
the miners with beef; but, on the other hand, there was a. great deal of
stealing, so that he was obliged to hire more men than usual. The far
vorite objects of the thieves weie our saddle- horses, and every few days
a horse would be missing from the paddock, and the chances of his re-
cover y were doubtful.

"But we had one horse that was a treasure. He was perfectly
docile in harness, and would stand quietly while being saddled, but any- .
body who mounted him was thrown at once. He was kept as a car--
riagehorse, and was a favorite of the manager, and was so docile that
he could be caught at any time with a handful of oats.

" Once or twice a month he would be missed from the paddock. In
a day or two he reappeared, and almost always-with a saddle and some--
body's 'swag,' or bagg 0e, strapped to it. Once he came back with a.
new saddle and a swag containing, among other things, thirty ounces
of golddust, and nobody ever appeared to claim it. Another time he
brought in twenty ounces and three gold watches. Altogether, in the
course of a year, he was stolen about twenty times, and must have
brought home two or three thousand dollars' worth of gold-(lust, to sayA HORSE-TRADERS TRICK. 397

nothing of the saddles. He kept the place supplied with saddles all
the time I was there."

"A very profitable horse," remarked Doctor Bronson. "I suppose
the owner was not willing to sell him?"

" Not by any means," was the reply. " He used to say that he had
only to 'set' that horse in the paddock as he would any other trap,
and the thieves walked in at once."

"That reminds me of a Melbourne horse story," said one of the
listeners. Being pressed to give it, he did so.

 

Tm! RUSH FOR THE BOLD-MINES.

"In the days of the gold rush in 1851," said he, "there were two
men in Melbourne who made a fortune in horse-trading. They had
two or three horses trained for their business, and When a, party was
fitting out for the mines, one of these horses would be ofi'ered for sale.
Of course the would-be purchasers wanted to try the animal first, and
the dealer would point to a steep hill on Bourke Street, and suggest
that the horse be tried with a load up that hill.

" The animal was attached to a loaded dray, and straightway pulled
it to the top of the hill without hesitation or pause. Of course that
settled the question of his usefulness, and he would be sold at a good
price; but when attached to a load and started for the mines, he balked
and refused to pull at all. Silent partners of the dealer were watch-
ing on the road, with other horses for sale, and they soon made a trade
in which the balky beast was
thrown in for almost nothing.

"The fact was, the trick-horses
were fed at the top of the hill, and
only after they had drawn up a
heavy load. Sometimes the same
horse Was sold two or three times
in one day; and it was afterwards
said that a single horse had been
disposed of for fifty pounds and
bought in for five pounds at least
a hundred times."

"I can't tell a horse story," said
another of the party, "but I've one
that comes close to it, and that's a
horse-collar story."

Of course everybody wanted to
hear it, and be complied with the
general wish.

." You all know that soon after
the discovery of gold in Victoria
the country was infested with bush-
rangers, or highwaymen, who made

A man was liable to hear the order
to ' bail up!' at any moment, and find a gun or pistol levelled at him.
Unless he obeyed with alacrity and threw his hands in the air, he was
in great danger of having a. bullet through him. Very often it happened
that an armed man would be taken unawares, and though he had a rifle
in his hand or a pistol at his belt, there was no chance to make use of
the weapon. Sometimes two or three bush-rangers would 'stick up ' a
stage-coach; while one watched the passengers, ranged along the road-
side, and kept them within range of a revolver, and perhaps two re-
volvers, another searched them and took possession of their valuables.
" Gold was sent down from the mines under a. Government escortADVENTURE WITH A HORSE-COLLAR. 399.

to protect it from the bush-rangers, and of course a heavy charge was
made for the service. Various devices were adopted to foil the rascals
by those who undertook to transport their own treasure.

"Men concealed their gold in their clothing or about their wagons,
and one smart fellow put nearly a hundred ounces inside a horse-collar,
which was worn by the single horse drawing a dray containing a few
bundles of clothing and other insignificant things.

"He got along all right for the first two days, and on the third
began to feel entirely safe. While he was jogging along the read he
was overtaken by a man who said the police were after him on account

of a fight with a. drunken fellow at a way-side inn. He said his horse
was much jaded, and he would give the stranger ten sovereigns to ex-

change.
"The bargain was quickly made, as'the animals appeared to be of
about equal value. The miner unfastened his horse from the dray, and
began to unharness it. As he did so the stranger, quick as a flash, seized
the collar, threw it around the neck of his own steed, sprung on its
back, where the saddle still remained, and was off like the wind.

"'That's all I wanted, mate,' said he, as he rode away. He had
somehow learned the miner's scheme for carrying his gold, and played
this elaborate game to rob him."

" Speaking of bush-rangers," said another, "did you ever hear of
Oliver, 'the Terror of the North 3' "

Some had heard of him and others had not, so the story was called
for.

" There was once a bush-ranger of that name in the north of Queens-
land," said the narrator, "and he had been ' sticking up' people in the
country back of Robinson. He had a wooden leg, but in spite of this
defect he was a bold robber and a very slippery one to hold. He got
away from the police several times after they had fairly caught him;
and catching him was no small matter.

"One time when he'd been at his tricks, the police got him and
brought him to Robinson. The jail there was in a very bad condition,
and the police magistrate was at a, loss how to keep Oliver, until a
happy thought struck him. What do you suppose it was ?"

Nobody could guess, and the story-teller continued:

"Well, be locked Oliver up in the jail, but took his leg to his own
house, and looked that in a ti unk Oliver stayed that time, and didn't
even try to break jail"

"We were speaking of horses just now," said one of the party, "and
that reminds me of a clever trick which was played on a rich squatter
by a man in his employ. He had sent the man on an errand, and
mounted him on a valuable white horse. It was at the rainy season of
the year, and all the creeks were flooded. On the bank of a creek
which he had to cross the man spied a white horse lying dead at the
water's side.

" A brilliant idea occurred to him, an inspiration of rascally genius.
He dismounted, skinned the dead horse, concealed the skin in the
bushes, and rode away, and sold the animal he was riding for a good
price. Then he returned to where he had concealed the skin; and after
soaking his saddle and bridle in the river for an hour, he went backto
the station, carrying saddle, bridle, and skin, and covered from head to
foot with mud. There he told how in attempting to cross a creek the
horse was overcome by the waters, and had just strength to reach theHOW A RASCAL CHEATED HIS EMPLOYER. 401

bank, where he died. As for himself, he had a narrow escape with his
life; and to prove the truth of his story, he had brought home the skin
of the once valuable beast.

"The squatter believed the story, blamed himself for sending the
man on such a dangerous mission, and gave him ten sovereigns as a. re-
ward for his fidelity and compensation for his wetting. The man left
the place soon afterwards for another part of the colony; months later _
the squatter saw his horse advertised for sale, and on inquiry found how
he had been imposed upon." .

 

lBADING CITIZEXS 0P SOMERSET.

From anecdotes about horses and bush dangers the conversation
turned upon the pearl-fishery on the northern coast of Queensland.

" It is quite an extensive industry," said Mr. Watson, " and employs
a considerable number of men. The exports of pearl-shell from Queens-
land for the year 1885 were 13,189 hundred-weight, valued at PS87,110,
or $400,000; and in some years the product has exceeded that amount.
Other parts of Australia produce pearl-shell and pearls, and altogether
the fishery is a. very important one."

26
Doctor Bronson asked if it was profitable.

" Very much so," was the reply. " At one time pearl-shell was worth
PS250 a ton; the pearls were reckoned to pay the cost of the work, so_
that the money obtained for the shell was clear profit. Even when
shell fell to half that price the profits were heavy; and certainly they
ought to he, to induce a man to
endure the privations of the work.

" The best pearls are from the
west coast of Australia; they are
not equal to Oriental pearls in
color, but they are very large,
and are eagerly sought. One
was sold in London for PS1500,
or $7500; and frequently single
pearls bring as high as $2000.

"I stopped a short time at
Somerset, which is the most north-
erly town in Australia, and entire-
ly devoted to the pearl-fishery.
The men living there are a rough

1:an ors-nm. lot, wearing very little superflu-
ous clothing, and quite careless
about appearances. They go out with sloops and schooners, and send
down divers in just the same way that pearl-diving is carried on in
Ceylon and the Persian Gulf. Their divers are all black men, and in fact
many of them come from the Persian Gulf, being attracted to Australia
by the higher wages paid there.
The shells are shaped like oyster-
shells, and are from twelve to
fifteen inches across. The lining
of the shell, technically known as
nacre, or mother~of--pea.r1, is the
article sought; but the oyster is
carefully examined to see that no AUSTRALIAN mus (FULL SIZE)
pearls are missed."

"Didn't I read not long ago about the drowning of many pearl-
fishers on the coast of West Australia?" said one of the youths.

" Quite probably," was the reply, "and you are liable to hear of such
a calamity at any time. The West Australian fisheries are subject to
terrific hurricanes. The signs of these hurricanes are well known, andTHE " CARDWELL PET." 403

every fishing-boat has ample time to reach a place of safety; but the

fishers are too reckless to take any precautions, and every few months a.
lot of their boats are sent to the bottom or driven high and dry on the
shore. The few that escape death on such occasions immediame get
new boats, and start off on another expedition as if such a thing as a
hurricane had never been heard of,

"Alligators abound in all the rivers of the northern part of Aus-
tralia; they grow to a great size and are dangerous, and not a year
passes that we do not hear of somebody being killed by them while
taking a swim or attempting to cross a swollen stream. They are great
nuisances at cattle and sheep stations located on the rivers where they
abound, as they make a clean sweep of calves, dogs, sheep, and other
small animals while drinking, and have been known to attack full-grown
bullocks."

"Did you ever know an adult alligator to be treated as a pet 3"
said the man who had told the horse--collar story, addressing his query
to Mr. Watson.

Mr. Watson shook his head, whereupon the story-teller said he had
known such a case. The saurian was not only an individual but a pub-
lic pet.

Frank and Fred were curious to learn about it. Their curiosity was
gratified as follows:

"Years ago," said the man, "I was at the town of Cardwell, in
North Queensland. It is on a pretty bay, which is full of fish and oys--
ters, and was then the home of a monster alligator which was known
as the 'Cardwell Pet.' Every morning something resembling a huge
log was seen floating under the trees near the shore; it was not a log,
but the back of the pet, and he was on the lookout for a, stray dog com-
ing down to the water.

" He ate up most of the dogs in town soon after he appeared, and
whenever a new dog happened along with a stranger he usually became
a ban/ac Imwhe for the pet. But there were two dogs in Cardwell that
knew his ways; when ordered to do so, they would go down on the
beach, where they barked and played with each other, apparently heed-
less of the alligator, but all the time keeping out of range of his jaws.
In this way he was often enticed out upon the sand, the dogs seeming
to enjoy the fun. He became the lion of the place, and was always the
first sight shown to strangers. When the town was first established,
shots were fired at him; but as soon as his importance as a curiosity
became known, he enjoyed immunity, and at the time I was there any
one who ventured to harm him would have been roughly handled by
the inhabitants, as he was literally the pet of the town."

Frank asked the narrator if he knew how large the Cardwell Pet
was.

"I do not," was the reply, "and circumstances did not permit accu-
rate measurement. I have seen many alligators in Queensland that ex-
ceeded nineteen feet in length, several that were more than twenty, and
there was one taken on the Fitzroy and called Big Ben that measured

twenty-three feet six inches. When I last heard of him he was owned
by J amrach, in London. I think the Cal-dwell Pet was quite equal to
Big Ben, and possibly larger; you know it is always the largest fish
that is not weighed or measured. Anyway, the pet was said to have
made a meal of a. sundowner, though I don't believe he really did, as
that class of game is too cautious."

Fred asked what a sundowner was. He had heard the term several
times, but thus far it had not been explained to him.

"' He is the equivalent of the American 'tramp,' "' said Mr. Watson,
"and abounds freely in Australia. He is fed and lodged at the sta-
tions,where he is careful to arrive at sundown or a little later, and
hence his name. If he gets there before sunset he is requested to move
on to the next stopping-place, or else he is asked to make himself use-
ful at some kind of work during the remaining hours or minutes of
the day. He abhors work, and therefore times his arrival to avoid it.
Sometimes a group of these fellows will rest by the way-side a mile or
so from a station, waiting for the sun to disappear.H suunowunns." 405-

"Many a vagabond makes an easy living by wandering from one
station to another, pretending that he wants employment but carefully
avoiding it. The sundowner is as insolent as the American tramp; by

SEVERAL days were passed agreeably in the pastoral and agricult-
ural region of the Darling Downs, and our friends were over-
whehned with invitations from the hospitable squatters who inhabit
that region. Fred said the invitations would have enabled them to
spend a year there, and even then he
was confident their welcome would not
be worn out. Wherever they went
they were comfortably lodged and well
cared for, and they were unanimous
in declaring that the world contained
many worse places than the Darling
Downs, even among those that were
classed as highly attractive.

Frank considered the flies and oth-
er creeping and winged things a great A" "mum Pm
drawback to existence in that region.

"They have mosquitoes and sand-flies in certain localities," said he,
" While others are entirely free from them; but as for the common fly,
he is everywhere and is a firstelass nuisance. On the coast the flies
are said to be troublesome only for a few months in the year, but in
the interior they are perennial, and sometimes almost make life a. bur-
den. They are worse at some periods than at others, but bad enough
at all times. In the worst ' fly-time' nobody ventures to ride about
without wearing a veil; and men have taxed their ingenuity to keep
the pests out of their houses, but practically without success.

"Fleas are also abundant, though not as much so as flies; neither
are they seen as much in public. They abound most in sandy places,
and the sundowners transport them from one station to another free of
charge. A more welcome insect is the common honey-bee; it has long
been acclimatized in Australia, and owing to the great number of honey-
bearing flowers, it has become very abundant. Beefarming is an impor-
tant industry in New South Wales, and is carried on to quite an extent
in the other colonies.

"They tell us that in the north of Queensland white ants are very

destructive, as they eat nearly every textile fabric, and have a voracious
appetite for all kinds of wood. They have even been charged with
devouring window-glass, iron bars, and similar substances usually con-
sidered inedible. I heard a man say with the utmost gravity that they
had eaten up two crosscut saws and a boxful of American axes, han-
dles and all; but I don't believe it, and I doubt his veracity in several
other statements he made, and therefore won't repeat them."

One day while the youths were strolling in the bush not far from
the station, they were startled by the sound of immoderate laughter
that seemed to come from among the limbs of a low tree. The sound
was repeated after a short interval, and, curious to know the cause, theyLAUGHING JACKASSES. 409

'went in its direction. As they neared the tree, two or three birds flew
from it and settled in another tree a short distance away. They did
not seem at all alarmed at the presence of Frank and Fred, and the lat--
ter remarked that the creatures were evidently aJIOWed to go about
unharmed. On their return to the station they told what they had
seen and heard, and asked what were the birds that had so surprised
them.

 

THE AUSTRALIAN HOWE-BIRD.

"Those Were laughing-jackasses," was the reply; "or if you want
another name for them, you may choose between 'giant kingfisher,'
'piping crow,' 'musical magpie,' or 'settler's clock.' The bird under
consideration belongs to the kingfisher family, and is called by all these
names, the last being given on account of the uproar he makes at noon,
and thus tells the settler who does not carry a watch when the middle
of the day is reached. Many people believe he destroys snakes; some
of us are skeptical on this point, which has never been satisfactorily
decided; but at any rate he is useful, as he often indicates the locality
of fresh water, and so has saved many persons from suffering, or per-I
haps perishing of thirst. He is never shot, and consequently is not
fearful of the presence of man.

" I wonder you have not heard the bird before this," he continued,
" as he abounds near the cities and towns as well as in the bush." Then
the boys remembered that they had heard the same sound on several
occasions, but always supposed it was somebody laughing, and did not
consider it any business of theirs to investigate.

"There's another curious bird in Australia," said their informant,
" which we call the satin, or bower, bird. He builds a bower, or walk,
and decorates it with any gaudy feathers or other things he can find,
and also with shells, bleached bones, and similar small objects. So well
is his propensity known that when we drop a pipebowl or a penknife
in the bush, we search for it in the bowers or runs of these birds, and
very often find it there. As the bower-bird feeds entirely on seeds and
fruits, it is evident that he secures these small things for the sake of
ornament."

Fred suggested that perhaps the bower-bird had been infected with
the bi'ic-zirbrac craze which pervades society in other countries. The
ambition to gather a cabinet of curiosities was a fashionable one, and
why shouldn't a bird have it as well as any one else.

Frank asked if it was possible to see a lyre-bird in that region, and
was disappointed when told that it wasrarely seen outside of the fern
country of Southeastern Australia. Their authority on birds told them
that this Winged emblem of Australia was about the size of a pheasant,
and had a tail three feet long; the outer feathers of the tail are beauti-
fully marked, and form the lyre from which the bird takes its name.
The male bird forms a mound of earth on which he promenades, dis-
playing his beautiful tail to its utmost advantage, in the same way that
the peacock exhibits his feathered ornaments. The female is as plain
as an ordinary hen, and presents a very mean appearance by the side of
her lord.

The youths were further informed that the lyre-bird is an excellent
mocking-bird, and could imitate with exactness the notes of all the other
feathered denizens of the forest. " He can also," said their authority,
"reproduce nearly every sound made by man. Settlers in the region
inhabited by these birds are often deceived by them, and many amusing
stories are told. Sometimes a man working on his clearing bears some-
body chopping wood a short distance away, and a dog barking at hisTRICKS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PHEASANT. 411

heels. He goes in search of the intruder, and finds after a long walk
that the 'pheasant' has been making game of him. A man using a;
cross-cut saw hears somebody doing the same thing, and after searching
unsuccessfully for him, discovers that it is the pheasant's performance."

Frank summed up the rest of the ornithology of Australia as fol-
lows:

"The great southern continent has many varieties of the parrot
family; it possesses the king parrot, the bird-of-paradise, the blue
mountain-parrot, the cockatoo--blue,_white, and crested--lories, par-
oquets, and lovebirds. It has the wild turkey, which we have already
mentioned, and a. bird closely allied to it, called by the singular name
of ' native companion.' Wildducks are found all over the country, the
' mountain duck' being the finest; then in their order come the black
duck, Wood-duck, and the Australian teal, followed by five or six other
varieties less known and less liked by sportsmen."

"Don't forget the black swan among the water-birds," said Fred, as
Frank paused after reading the foregoing paragraph.

"I was not forgetting him," replied Frank; "what would be our
picture of Australia. without the black swan? He is found in all the
lakes and swamps of the southern coast; in the Gippsland lakes thou-
sands of black swans may sometimes be seen in a single flock, and the
sound of their feet and wings strik-
ing the water as they rise for a
flight may be heard for miles when
the air is still. The black swan is
not strictly a game-bird; his flesh
is rather rank, but this taste can be
removed in cooking, and then he
isn't at all bad to eat.

"Going from large birds to
small," continued the youth, " I
learn that snipe are abundant in
many localities, but they do not
seem to be appreciated as in Eng-
land and America. The Argus
snipe is the prettiest of the family,
and also the most difficult to find;
he is beautifully marked on the
back and wings, and is a valuable
addition to an ornithological col-
lection. nun or rm: nu." QUAIL.

"There are at least a dozen va-
rieties of quail in Australia, and as articles of food they are abundant
and cheap. With very little effort a settler in most parts of the country
could have quail on toast every day in the year ; at least the quail would
be easily forthcoming though the toast might not. Cold roast quail and
damper are not to be despised for lunch after a long ride in the bush."THE RIVERS OF THE GREAT SOUTHERN CONTINENT. 413

While Frank was busy with the study of the birds of Australia, Fred
contemplated with great care the map of the oountry. He observed
that all the mountain ranges were near the coast, so that the course of
the larger rivers was towards the interior. " There is not," said he in
his note-book, " a single large river flowing into the ocean from all this
great continent, with the exception of the Murray. Every other stream
is short and insignificant; and even the Murray and its tributaries do
not form a first-class river.

" Here we are," said Fred, " on the head streams of the Darling, one
of the rivers that unite with the Murray to pour into the sea through

 

A QUAIL FAMILY.

Lake Alexandria, between Melbourne and Adelaide. On looking at the
map I thought we should be able to descend in a. boat to the ocean, but
Mr. Watson tells us we can do nothing of the sort. Some of the rivers
on the maps are at this season simply dry beds, though at times they
have water enough to float a firstrclass boat from the Mississippi.

" Steamboats have ascended the Darling to Walgett, 2345 miles from
the sea, but they can only do so at certain, or rather uncertain, times,
and therefore no dependence can be placed on the navigation of the
Murray and its tributaries. The Darling depends on flood-waters; some-
times they will fill the stream to its junction with the Murray, and thence
to the sea, and again they fail before going half gray. The river can
never be navigated throughout the year, and in some years boats are
not able to run at all.
" So my scheme of going down by water to the ocean is not practi-
cable, and we return to the coast the way we came."

And return they did, taking the railway to Brisbane, and thence going
by coach and rail to Gympie, the centre of the Queensland gold-mining
region, or rather one of its centres, as the colony possesses several aurif-
erous fields. There is a standing ofier of a reward of PS1000, or $5000,

 

OUT PROSPEOHNG.

to any one who discovers paying golddeposits in a new locality upon
which there shall be upwards of two hundred men at work six months
after the fields are opened. Consequently a great many prospectors are
constantly at work, through the double hope of the reward and of mak-
ing a fortune out of the discovery.

The gold-fields of Gympie were discovered in 1868 by Mr. James
Nash, and the settlement which rose there was at first called Nashville.
The existence of the precious metal in the colony was known for at
least a decade before that date, but none of the mines had proved remu-
nerative. At present there are upwards of twenty gold-fields in Queens-
land, and the aggregate annual yield exceeds $5,000,000. From 1867
to 1885 inclusive the mines of Queensland yielded 4,840,221 ounces of
gold, valued at not far from $80,000,000.

But we are forgetting Frank and Fred in our contemplation of these
dry statistics. Here is what Frank wrote concerning their visit to
Gympie:

" We came here partly by rail and partly by coach, the railway from
Brisbane to Gympie not being completed, though perhaps it will be byFROM BRISBANE T0 GYMPIE. 4-15

the time this is in print, if it should ever have such good-fortune. It is
one hundred and sixteen miles from Brisbane to Gympie, and sixty-one
from here to Maryborough. The town is prettily situated on the side
of a range of hills on the river Mary; it has handsome public buildings,
and bears every evidence of prosperity. It has a School of Arts, a public
library, and other institutions not always to be found in mining towns,
and altogether deserves the good name that it bears. It has a popula-
tion of nearly eight thousand in the municipality alone, and there are
four thousand more in the immediate neighborhood.

 

 

 

 

QUAR'I'L--MILL IN THE GOLD-MINES.

"There are the usual paraphernalia of the mining industry, which
we have already described in other places. In every direction there are
mining-shafts and reduction-Works, and for miles and miles around the
country is full of prospecting holes, Where gold has been sought but not
found, at least in paying quantities. The first rush here was for the
alluvial diggings, and large amounts of gold were taken out by the early
comers.

"We were much interested in hearing about the adventures of Mr.
Nash, the discoverer of the gold~diggings here. He had been an unsuc--
cessful prospector for twenty years, had gone through all kinds of pri-
vations, narrowly escaped death at the hands of the blacks on many
occasions, and was almost killed by the earth caving in on him while
working a prospect hole. He always went by himself, and worked
alone. When he found gold here he managed to work away for three
months without interruption; then he was discovered by a stockman,
who took a claim next to his and spread the news abroad. Nash be
came a rich man at last, but his health was ruined, and he had little
real enjoyment of his wealth.

 

AUSTRALIAN GOLD-HUNTERS.

" The alluvial diggings at Gympie were soon worked out, and reef,
or quartz, mining followed. In fact, the reef mining began while placer
mining was at its height and the alluvial diggers were in the full tide
of success. The placers were, and the reefs are, very rich, and many of
the workings have paid enormously to their owners. Of course where
there have been so many prizes there has been a proportionate number
of blanks, and there is no telling how many thousands of men have left
Gympie poorer than when they came here.

"The town consists practically of a single street which struggles up
and down for more than a mile, with here and there an attempt to runUPS AND DOWNS OF MINING LIFE. 417

a lateral street in the direction of a mine or a crushing--mill. Most of
the houses are of wood, and scattered over the hills are the huts of the
miners, in order that they may be near the places where they are em-
ployed. This does not prevent their coming into the town in the even-
ing, and occasionally making it a very. lively place. In the early days
there were the usual disorderly scenes of the centre of a 'gold rush ;'
and one of the old inhabitants told us that a few months after the dis-
covery became known, it seemed as though half the bad characters in
Australia had congregated there.

"When the alluvial diggings had been exhausted, the wandering
miners disappeared and wended their way to newly reported fields.
The place became more orderly, and then the abandoned claims were
occupied by the Chinese, the most patient workers the world ever saw.

27
They are contented to take up what White men consider unprofitable,
and, considering all their disadvantages, they have done wonderfully
well. They are not allowed to enter any gold-field until it has been
open for two years; and there is a poll-tax of PS10 a head upon every
Chinese who enters the colony. They are generally peaceable, but
occasionally they quarrel among themselves over the right to work a
certain spot, and then the noise they make is something tremendous."

 

A ClllXSSE DISCUSSION.

From Gympie our friends went by rail to Maryborough, a seaport
town on the Mary River, twenty--five miles above its mouth, and one
hundred and eighty from Brisbane. The railway carried them past
many sugar plantations, and they learned that Maryborough is the
outlet of a considerable district devoted to sugar cultivation, the annual
product being not far from five thousand tons. Large quantities of
lumber are exported from Maryborough, and there is also a considerable
business in wool and hides from the cattle and sheep stations in the
country towards the interior.

Here they took steamer for Sydney, touching at Brisbane, New-
castle, and several other ports of lesser consequence. During their
voyage they became acquainted with a resident of one of the northern
ports, who had much to say about the advantages of his part of the
colony, and greatly regretted that they had not been able to visit it.

"It's a pity," said he, " that you missed the Great Barrier Reef,
which is one of the most remarkable geographical and geological phe--
nomena to be found anywhere on the globe. It stretches along the
whole eastern coast from opposite Port Bowen, in latitude 23deg, to
Torres Strait, at the extreme north of Queensland, and is one thousand
two hundred miles long. Its greatest width, which is near its southern
end, is about seventy miles, and it is from five to one hundred miles
from the shore of the continent. All along its whole length there are
sunken reefs, which make navigation in its vicinity very dangerous.
Many a ship has been lost on this reef, and scores or hundreds of per-
sons have found a watery grave by its side."

Fred asked if a ship inside the reef was obliged to go its entire
length before finding an opening to the ocean.

"Not at all," was the reply. "There are many openings to the
ocean through the reef, some of them very narrow and others several
miles in width; and the reef contains specimens of all kinds of coral
formation--atolls, fringing reefs, and others. The portion of the reef
above water, and the numerous coral islands near it, are thought to
have an aggregate surface of thirty thousand miles."

"What is supposed to haxe caused the formation of this reef?"
F rank inquired.

" The outer margin of the Great Bairier Reef p1obably indicates the
former coast- line of this pait of Aust1alia," was the reply. " This was
fringed with coral reefs; but as the land sank, the coral animals con-
tinued to build upward to the level of the sea, and thus a great ridge
was formed which was broken and heaped up by the waves of the
Pacific. Fresh water prevents the formation of coral, and the openings
in the Great Barrier Reef are thus formed by the fresh-water streams.
The largest is opposite the mouth of the Burdekin River, which drains
a considerable area of country.

" The reef is a. good place for sport, just as are the reefs of the
Feejee, Samoan, and Society Islands, which you tell me you have
visited. Vessels go there in search of beche-de-mer, for which they
have a good market in China. The fishery for this curious article of
food is practically just the same as in the island groups of the Pacific,
and therefore I need not describe it to you.

"Very good sport can be had in Northern Queensland in hunting
the dugong, or seacow. This animal abounds along the coast of that'
   

region; its flesh is not bad eat-
ing, and its oil was formerly in
demand as a substitute for cod-
liver oil, but some of the fisher-
men got to mixing it with shark-
oil and other abominations, so
that its good name was ruined.
If you have a taste for turtle-catching, it can be accommodated. We
supply the Sydney and Melbourne markets with green turtle, and also
put the soup and meat into tin cans and send it to England. There
are numerous fishes, some good to eat, and others worthless as articles
of food but with all the colors of the rainbow. We have sharks of the
largest size, and the stranger should be careful about venturing into the
water for a bath."

Their new aoquaintance had a great deal to say about the northern
part of Queensland, whose praises he was never weary of sounding. I-Ie
declared that within a. very few years Queensland would consist of two
colonies instead of one, as the north was inclined to cut loose from the
south and set up a government of its own. He thought it did not
receive its fair share of the public money, and having paid its propor-

tion of the taxes, it had a right to grumble when the south received
all the appropriations for railways and other costly improvements.

On his arrival in Sydney Doctor Bronson called at once on the gen-
tleman who had invited the party to see the interior of New South
Wales. Arrangements were made for immediate departure, and at
nine o'clock on the following morning they were off for the upper
country.

So far as their experiences of cattle and sheep stations were con-
cerned, they were practically a repetition of what they had gone through
in Queensland. A new feature of the trip was a kangaroo hunt to
which they were invited, and of which Fred gives the following account:

"You must know that this is the land of marsupials, or animals
which carry their young in a. pouch until they are able to take care of
themselves. Nearly all the animals of this country belong to this fam-
ily; and geological researches show that there were once some marsu-
pials here that equalled if they did not exceed in size the rhinoceros and

 

THE "ANATBB, 0R DUGONG.

hippopotamus. But these big fellows are all extinct; there are one
hundred and ten species now, and the largest of them does not exceed
two hundred pounds in weight.

" The largest of the marsupials is the kangaroo, and the next in size
is the Wallaby. There are eight species of large kangaroo, inhabiting
different parts of the country, the prince of them all being the red kan-
garoo of South Australia. Then come seventeen species of small kan-

garoos (IIalmatnrzw), weighing from ten to fifteen pounds; and then
27*
three species of silky-haired kangaroos (Onyckogalea), inhabiting the
interior of the continent. They weigh eight or ten pounds, and are
about the size of a common rabbit; then come five species of hare-kan-
garoos, five of jerboa--kangaroos, and then the rat-kangaroos, the bandi-

 

coots, opossums, 'rabbitrats,' and numerous other small animals. We'll
go back to the large kangaroos, where we began.

"In former times, when the only human inhabitants of Australia
were the savage blacks, the kangaroo was kept from increasing too rap-
idly, through the combined efforts of the (lingoes and the natives. The
dingo is the Australian wild dog, and closely allied to the wolf and
jackal, of which he is certainly the first-cousin. He is carnivorous, and
fond of sheep, and was therefore poisoned and otherwise killed off by
the settlers, to prevent his depredations upon the flocks. A bounty was
placed on his scalp, and he has been greatly reduced in numbers. The
natives have likewise died off since the settlement of the country; and
with their natural enemies removed, the kangaroos, which live wholly
on grass, have increased till they have become a nuisance. A kangarooA KANGAROO DRIVE. 423

eats as much as a. sheep, and when a drove is undisturbed its numbers
multiply with a rapidity that dismays the squatter on whose land it has ,
made its home.

"Our host gave us the foregoing information while we were riding
to the place where we were to enjoy the sensation of hunting the kan-
garoo. He furthermore told us that it was no uncommon thing for
them to kill several hundred kangaroos in a single drive, but it could
not be called sport. He said a drive wasn't a. hunt, and I asked him
to explain the difference, which he did. '

"The necessity of killing off the kangaroos to prevent their utter
destruction of all the grass in the country was forced upon the settlers
by the rapid increase of the animals. The Government passed a law
giving a. bounty for the scalps of kangaroos; and none too soon, as in
some parts of the country the droves fairly blackened the plains for

 

DIRGOB, OR AUSTRALIAN WILD DOGS.

many miles, and literally starved the sheep out of the country. The
bounty on the scalps, added to the value of the meat and skins, partly
paid for the trouble, which required a muster of all the squatters and
their employes for a considerable distance around.

" A drive, or battne, is managed in this way: A yard with a high
fence is built in one of the scrubs on the plains, and from this yard two
fences run out on the plain for a long distance, widening like the sides
of the letter V. All the men, boys, and blacks in the neighborhood are
mounted on horseback, and
scour the country for many
miles around; they move
in the direction of the jaws
of the V, and when the
herd is once inside it, the
animals are doomed. They
go straight towards the
scrub which conceals the
yard, and do not discover
where they are till they
are inside the enclosure.

jump clean over a horse,

and therefore the fence must be not less than seven feet high to pre
vent his escape when frightened.

"We were not bent on any such performance, which is nothing
but slaughter, though made necessary by the conditions of the coun-
try. I Imay add here that in some parts of the colony it is often
necessary to make a. drive of wild horses exactly as they drive the
kangaroo. It is no uncommon matter for a squatter to make a
drive of four or five hundred wild horses, which are killed for their
hides, but more especially to prevent their eating the grass, destroying
the fences, and enticing tame horses out of the paddocks. We have
seen several droves of wild horses, and they look very pretty as they
gallop over the plain. We wished we had some of them under the
saddle, but were told that the value of the animal rarely pays for the
trouble and cost of breaking him. Occasionally horses with brands on
them are found in the wild herds; they are impounded and advertised;
at least such is the theory, but quite as often they are killed with the
rest to save trouble.

" A black boy mounted on a swift horse came riding back to us, and
said the kangaroos were in a part of the plain that was concealed from
us by a patch of scrub. We moved in their direction, keeping the scrubHUNTING THE LARGE MARSUPIALS. 425

between us and them, so as to get as close as possible before they dis-
covered us.

"Our manoeuvre worked very well. There were ten or twelve of
the animals feeding quietly, and we were within a few hundred yards
of them before they were aware of it. At the first alarm they rose on
their hind-legs and took a look all around, and a second later they were
away. How they did jump! They seemed to go thirty or forty feet
at a time, but our host says it was little if any more than fifteen feet.
Even that is a tremendous jump; if you don't think so, just try it,

 

A KANGAROO BA'K'I'ES, OIL DRIVE.

" We let loose the dogs, which up to this time had been kept behind
us, and they went away without any urging. The dogs are kept for
this purpose, just as fox-hounds are kept in England and France, or
deer-hounds in Scotland. The dogs soon overtook and pulled down a
young kangaroo; this caused some delay, but not much, and they were
speedily put on the track of an 'old man' kangaroo, as a full-grown
male is called.

"The ' old man' led the dogs a. lively chase. He made directly for
water, several miles away, which is always the custom of the kangaroo;

the dogs as closely as we could,
but did not come up to them
until the kangaroo was at bay
in a pool where the water just
left his fore-legs clear as he
stood upright,

of reach of his legs. Had they
come within grasping distance
he would have held them
under water till they were

drowned, or else have ripped them open with a blow from his powerful
hind-leg, which has a. claw in the middle capable of inflicting a fatal

wound upon man or dog.

"The dogs swam around him, or stood on the shore of the pool,
when we came up. The pool was a. small one, and the creature realized

that it was his safest retreat,
and he was evidently deter-
mined to die game. A shot
from a rifle in the hands of one
of the men finished him, and
he was quickly dragged to the
shore. Fortunately, not a dog
was killed or injured; rarely
does a} hunt terminate without
some one or more of the dogs
receiving a scratch, and nearly
every kangaroo-dog in the coun-
try has a scar or two to show
as evidence of his experience
and prowess.

"After this exploit we dis-
mounted, and took our lunch.

 

SHORT BARF" KANGAROO.USES OF KANGAROO SKINS. 427

Thenwe made a circuitous journey homeward, and reused up another-
' old man,' which we despatched as he stood fighting with his back to
. a tree, but not till he had wounded one of the dogs. Another full-grown
kangaroo was killed by one of the stockmen the same day, in another
part of the run, and the three skins will be properly cured and sent to
Doctor Bronson and ourselves as souvenirs of the day's experience.

" We supped on steaks from a young kangaroo; the meat of the old
and full-grown animals is too rank to be enjoyable, and is usually fed
to the dogs. We had soup made from kangaroo tail, and it was deli-
cious; kangaroo soup has become an article of export, and seine epi-
cures are said to prefer it to ox--tail, or even to turtle soup, though I
very much doubt the latter statement.

" Our host says the natives in former times were very skilful in kill-
ing the kangaroo with the boomerang; when a native armed with this
weapon was within reach of a kangaroo, the aim rarely missed. An-
other way of killing the creature was by stalking. The blackfellow
dressed himself with twigs and brush to look like a small tree. In this
disguise, and carrying his spear between two toes of his foot, he ad-
vanced slowly, taking care to keep to leeward, so that the animal could
not get the scent. Slowly he closed up, remaining motionless when the
kangaroo looked up, and moving again when it began to graze. Once
within spearing distance, he speedily settled the question of dinner or
no dinner from the flesh of that identical beast."

Frank asked what became of the skins of the kangaroos when they
were slaughtered by wholesale, as already described.

"They are pegged out on the ground and dried," said their host,
" and then are shipped to market. Many of them go to America, where
they are made into leather for boots and shoes and other purposes. The
leather is very tenacious, and almost impervious to water, and the de-
mand for it is said to be increasing. Previous to 1869 very few of the
skins were tanned, as the merits of the leather had not become known.
The first that were sent to America were sold at a loss, and then in
a few years, when their qualities were known, the American tanners
could not get enough of them. One firm in Newark, New Jersey, is
said to receive six thousand skins every week, and even with that num-
ber cannot meet the demand for kangaroo leather."

During the evening, stories of kangaroo hunts were naturally in
order, and a goodly number were told; but as all were of the same gen-
eral character it is hardly necessary to give them. Frank made note
of the fact that there is one kind of kangaroo which climbs trees and
jumps, like a. squirrel, from limb to limb. He is called the tree-kangar
roo, and has curved claws on his fore-paws to enable him to cling to the
branches. He is not a, bad pet to have about. a. park, but his numbers
should be judiciously kept down, or he may become a, nuisance, like the '
larger kangaroos that live on the ground.

BEFORE returning to the coast our friends had an opportunity to
visit a native encampment and see a. corroboree. The reader nat--
urally asks what a corroboree is; we will see presently.

Arrangements were made by their host, and early one morning the
party was off for the native' encampment, which was nearly thirty miles
away. A tent and provisions had been sent along the previous evening,
so that the travellers had nothing to carry on their horses beyond a
lunch, which they ate in a shepherd's but at one of the out stations.
Early in the afternoon they reached their tent, which had been pitched
on the bank of a brook about half a. mile from the village they intended
to visit.

Taking an early dinner, they set out on foot for the encampment,
being guided by a native who had come to escort them. We will let
Frank tell the story of the entertainment.

"The village was merely a collection of huts of bark, open at one
side, and forming a shelter against the wind, though it would have been
hardly equal to keeping out a severe storm. To construct these huts
the bark had been stripped from several trees in the vicinity. Fires
were burning in front of most of the huts, and care was taken that they
did not extend to the trees, and thus get a. start through the forest.

"There was an odor of singed wool and burning meat, but no food
was in sight. The blacks are supposed to live upon kangaroo meat as
their principal viand, but a good many cattle and sheep disappear when-
ever a tribe of them is in the neighborhood of the herds and flocks.
In addition to kangaroo, they eat the meat of the wallaby, opossum,
wombat, native bear, and other animals, and are fond of eels and any
kind of fish that come to their hands, or rather to their nets and spears.
Emus, ducks, turkeys--in fact, pretty nearly everything that lives and
moves, including ants and their eggs, grubs, earth-worms, moths, beetles,
and other insects--are welcome additions to the aboriginal larder. All
the fruits of trees and bushes, together with many roots and edible
grasses and other plants, are included in their bill of fare.

"There were twenty or more dirty and repulsive men and women in
the village, some squatted or seated around the fires, and others walk-
ing or standing carelessly in the immediate vicinity. A dozen thin and
vicious-looking dogs growled at us as we approached, but were speedily _,
silenced by their owners. These dogs were simply the native dingoes,
either born in captivity or caught when very young and domesticated.
They are poorly fed, and the squatters say they can generally distin-
guish a. wild dog from one belonging to the blacks, by the latter being
thin and the former in good condition.

" More women than men were visible, and it was explained that
the men who were to take part in the corroboree were away mak-
ing their preparations. The corroboree is a dance which was formerly
quite common among the tribes, but has latterly gone a good deal out
of fashion. At present it is not often given, except when, as in the
present instance, strangers are willing to pay something in order to see
it. Our host had arranged it for us, and the camping party that pre-
ceded us with the pack-horses had brought the stipulated amount of
cloth, sugar, and other things that were to constitute the payment for
the entertainment.

" We tried to make friends with some of the children, but they were
decidedly shy, and we soon gave it up. In a little while the men who
were to dance came out from the forest, and as they did so the women
formed in a semicircle at one side of the cleared space in the middle of
the encampment; and some of the men brought fresh supplies of wood, '
and heaped it on the central fire. The women sat on the ground, and
each had an opossum rug stretched tightly across her knees and form--
ing a sort of drum.

"The dancers assembled in the centre near the fire; they were only
their opossum rugs around the loins, and the exposed parts of their bod-
ies were streaked with paint in the most fantastic manner imaginable.--: Java--Farm < Hp.-- Oman--awa<
Faces and bodies were adorned with white and red paint, and altogeth-
er the aspect was a combination of the ludicrous and the hideous The
leader, holding a stick' 111 each hand, took his place midway between the
women and the fire, and at a signal from him the women began a chant,
and kept time by beating with their
hands upon the opossum-skins.

" Suddenly the leader struck the
two sticks together, and the dancers
formed in line. When the line was
completed he struck them again, in
unison with the chant and the time
beaten on the drums. The dancers
regulated their movements by the
music, throwing themselves into all
sorts of positions, moving to the right
or the left, advancing or retreating,
standing straight in line, circling
around each other, and in a. general
way forming figures not altogether
unlike those of civilized dancers in
other lands.

" As the dance went on, the lead
er quickened the time; the chant and
drumming quickened likewise, and so

sonmxxo r011 BREAKFAST. did the exertions Of the performers.

They grew hot, and perspired at ev-

ery pore; faster and faster went the music; faster and faster were the

movements of the bodies, till it seemed as though they would drop from
exhaustion.

"Suddenly the men, as if by a prearranged plan, jumped higher
than ever into the air, and as they did so each gave a sort of shrill
shout. The drumming and chanting ceased immediately, and the men
fled to rest in the shelter of the bushes. There they remained for per-
haps a quarter of an hour, and then they returned and resumed the
dance. The second part was much like the first, except that some of
the figures were different; the whole performance showed that it was
the result of practice, as the time was well kept and all the movements
were based upon a system of no insignificant character. At the end the
leader gave two heavy strokes with his sticks, the men retreated, the
women followed them, and the dance was at an end.CEREMONIES OF THE ABORIGINALS. 433

" We are told that the natives have various dances, and in this par-
ticular they resemble the savage tribes of most other lands. They have
their war-dances before and after fights, dances for the time when the
youths are ' made men '----_c'.e., when they attain their majority, and are
no longer to be classed as boys--dances in which only the women take
part, dances in which the movements of the kangaroo and other animals
are imitated, and a. variety of religious and. mystical dances to which
Europeans are never admitted. In some dances an entire tribe--men,
women, and children--participate; in others only the men, or only the
women; and there are certain dances in which several tribes may join.
All the people of the tribe are instructed in these dances, and the rules
concerning them must be observed with most scrupulous care.

"Nearly all the dances are performed at night, and quite often by
the light of the moon added to that of the fire. I have heard some
amusing descriptions of dances where there was a mimic battle between
white men and aboriginals, the fictitious white men biting their car-
tridges and going through the motions of loading and firing a gun with
great exactness. There was a representation of a herd of cattle feed-
ing, of some of the animals being speared by the blacks, who then went
through the motions of skinning and
cutting up the slaughtered beasts.
The movements of the kangaroo,
emu, and other animals were imi-
tated, and so were those of the pig,
the bear, and the opossum.

"At the end of the (lance we
went to our camp accompanied by
the natives, who were to receive
payment for the performance. Af-
ter their departure we sat around
the fire for a while listening to con
rombee stories, and then retired to
our blankets and to sleep. Our
dreams were filled with pictures of "A" "1" CW"-
yelling and gyrating natives, and a1-
together neither Fred nor myself felt much refreshed when we rose in
the morning; but we were all right in an hour or so, and shall always
remember our adventure among the Australian blacks.

"We heard some curious stories about their customs, particularly of
the way the men get their wives. Marriage as understood among civil-

28
ized people is unknown among the Australian blacks. Fathers dispose
of their daughters as they would of sheep or cattle; and if the father be
dead, the right falls to the nearest male relative. A man with a daugh-
ter of marriageable age arranges to dispose of her, and when the price
is agreed upon she is called forward and told that her husband wants
her. She may never have seen him before, or seen him only to detest
him; if she cries and protests, the father exercises his authority by prod-
ding her with a spear or striking her with a club, and he often winds up

 

AN AUSTRALIAN COUR'I'SXHP.

by seizing her by the hair and dragging her to the but of the man who
has bought her. If she attempts to run away she is clubbed into obe-
dience, and sometimes her father spears her through the leg or foot, so
that she cannot run.

"Among some of the tribes brothers exchange their sisters with
other men, so that a marriage is generally a double affair. There is no
ceremony, as we understand it, any more than in a horse-trade with us.

" If a man has no sister, he steals a wife from another tribe than his
own; he lies in wait in the neighborhood of the other tribe, and when a
young woman passes near him he rushes out and knocks her down with
a waddy, or club. Then he drags her to his hut and pounds her into
submission. Such a proceeding is perfectly proper, though it almost
invariably leads to a fight between the two tribes, no matter how friend-
ly they may have been before the occurrence. It is the duty of the
woman's tribe to avenge her abduction, and that of the man's to protect
the newly wedded couple.HOW A BLACK MAN ATTAINS HIS MAJORITY. 4:35

" The ceremonies for celebrating the coming of age of a. young man
vary a, good deal among the tribes, but in none of them is the perform-
ance a. pleasing one for the subject thereof. In one tribe he is shut up
in a. tent for a. whole month, and nearly starved ; in another he is shaved,
painted with mud and pigments, and compelled to sit in a pool of dirty
water for a whole day, while the rest of the tribe pelt him with mud; in
another he has two of his front teeth knocked out; and in another the
young heard on his chin is plucked out by the roots. In every case
pain is inflicted, so that the valor of the youth can be tested; and he is
expected to endure everything without flinching.

" During the night we had an alarm which roused us from sleep,
and for a. few moments it looked as though we were to have serious
business. There was a yell in the forest near us, and as we sprang out

 

THE NIGHT ALA".

of our blankets and went to the front of the tent, we saw a. crowd of
natives in war-paint brandishing their spears and waddies, and acting
as though they intended to attack us. Some of them were hideously
painted, and altogether the spectacle was not a pleasing one. After a
few demonstrations they retired, and our host told us it was a part of
our entertainment, to show how a night attack was made by the abo-
riginals.

" The mimic attack was quite sufficient for our purposes, and we
were quite willing not to pass through the experience of a real one.
We were told that had the attack been actual, the fust warning of it
would have been the hurling of spears. Very often it happens that a
camping party of white men has no knowledge that natives are within
many miles of them until the spears begin dropping in their midst.
Our host was once in a party of this sort; they were eight in all; five
of them were killed or wounded by the spears; but the remaining three
with their rifles and revolvers beat back the assailants, and thus saved
their lives." -

Our friends returned to the station without further adventure, and a
few days later were once more in Sydney, preparing to leave for Mel-
bourne. Up to the last moment of their stay they were busily occupied
with the attentions of the numerous acquaintances they had made, so
much so that they had barely time to write up their journals and pre-
serve a record of what they had seen and heard.

But there was one attention which was as unexpected as it was
interesting, though it could hardly be said to have been bestowed by
an inhabitant of the city. It was a visit from a " brickfielder," and is
thus described by Fred:

" Mention has been made already of the tendency of an Australian
to speak exultingly of the climate of his own city or section, and to
disparage that of other localities. All parts of the country sulfer from
the hot winds of the interior, but the inhabitants of each place declare
that it is worse anywhere else than with them. Be that as it may, our
first experience of the hot wind here in Sydney is quite bad enough, and
if Melbourne or Adelaide can surpass it we pity them.

" They call this wind 21 ' brickfielder,' probably because it brings a
vast quantity of dust such as might be blown from a field where bricks
are made or brickdust has been thickly strewn; and this was what we
saw and felt:

"There was a period of calm and ominous silence, and we observed
that the sky was changing from blue to a sort of fiery tinge. Puffs of
heated air came now and then, like blasts from a furnace; they grew
in force and frequency, and in an hour or so became a. steady wind with
increasing force. It was hot and dry and scorching, and we seemed to
be withering under its effects. ' It's a brickfielder, sure enough,' said aEXPERIENCES IN A BRICKFIELDER. 437

friend, and he cautioned us to get back to our hotel as soon as we could.
We took his advice, and went there.

"In a little while there was a driving volume of dark clouds like a.
London fog; the wind increased almost to a gale, and then came the
dust. It was not a. fine, impalpable sand, like that brought to Cairo by
the khwmseen in April, but a. perceptible and gritty dust that sifted into
every crevice and cranny, blinded our eyes, filled our ears, and made its
way inside our clothing, till we could feel that it was all over our skins.

 

 

RXCEI'HO)" OF A BRICKFIELDER.

Nothing is sacred to it, and it invades the most stately mansions as well
as the humblest cottages. The air was filled with dust gathered up
from the streets, in addition to what the wind brought from the inte-
rior; the dustiest and most disagreeable March day of New York was

the perfection of mildness compared to it.

" Windows and doors were closed, and it is the rule to keep them so
as long as a brickfielder lasts. The hot gale will make its way inside
if it can find the least opening, and then the entire house and all its
contents will be thickly sprinkled with dust. The heat was intolerable,
but there was no help for it, as an open door or window would only
bring more heat and the dust in addition. We looked out of the win-
dows, but the dust-cloud was so thick that we couldn't see across the
street. A few luckless wayfarers were clinging to posts or struggling
to keep their feet, and
those who were trying
to go against the wind
made very slow progress.

"The brickfielder last-
ed all day and far into
the night, and then it
suddenly stopped. With
its cessation there was a
heavy fall of rain, which
converted the dust into
mud and made pedestri-
anism anything but com-
fortable. They tell us
that these winds some-
times last two or three
(lays, or even longer;
they are always followed
by rain and a cool wind from the south, and never was cool wind more
acceptable than at such a time. Nobody can predict when the wind
will come, whether in a day, a week, or a, month; and when it does
come everybody prepares to stay in-doors, if he can possibly do so, and
wait till it is over. Every man, woman, and child has a dustcloak or
(lustrcoat to be worn when necessity compels going outrof-doors in a
brickfielder.

" One gentleman says these winds prefer to put in their appearance
on Sunday morning, just as the congregations are assembling in church.
' 'he dates of large picnic parties are also favorite times for their appear-
ance, and when they come the picnic ceases to be a delight. He says
that some years ago, in one of the Australian cities, arrangements had
been made for a grand banquet out-of--doors, the finest that had ever
been known in the colony. The date had long been fixed and extensive
arrangements made, invited guests came from afar, the best speakers
of the antipodes were present, and all was going finely, when suddenly,
just as the early courses of the banquet had been served, a brickfielder
came, and the scene was as disorderly as a political meeting in one of

 

A BlllCKPlBLDKR PUTTING IN ITS \VORK-FROM SYDNEY T0 GOULBURN. . 439

the lower wards of New York. The feast came to a. sudden end and
not a. speaker opened his mouth, lest it might be filled with dust.

"One swallow may not make a summer, but one brickiielder is
enough for a. whole year."

Consulting the railway time-table, Doctor Bronson found that the
express train for Melbourne left at 5.15 ML, and ran through in nine-
teen hours, thus makirig the greater part of its journey in the night.
As our friends wished to see as much of the country as possible during
their tour through Australia, they decided to take a. slower train at
9 A.M., which would bring them to Goulburn, one hundred and thirty-
four miles, at 4 P.M.' Another train at 10.35 the following morning
would reach the frontier at Albnry, three hundred and eighty-six miles
from Sydney, at eight o'clock in the evening. In this way they would
get a. good view of the country, and be able to say far more about its
features than if whizzed through on an express train at night.

 

BUILDING A RAILWAY 0}! I'll]! PLAINS.

The first railway in the colony of New South Wales was projected
in 1846, and within two years the surveys for the line to Goulburn
were completed. Ground was broken in Jilly, 1850, the first turf being
turned by the Hon. Mrs. Keith Stewart, in the presence of her father,
Governor Fitzroy, and a. large assemblage of people. The first railway-
line in the colony, from Sydney to Paramatta, was opened in 1855.

The engineering difficulties and the high rate of interest upon loans
retarded the work of railway building, so that in twenty years after
the opening of the first line only four hundred and six miles had been
completed; but in more recent times the enterprise has been rapidly
pushed, the mountains having been passed, and the construction upon
the great plains of the interior being comparatively easy. In Septem-
ber, 1886, no less than 1831 miles of railway were in operation in New
South Wales, and the Colonial Parliament had authorized 1590 miles
in addition, of which a part is now under construction.

The railways of New South Wales are divided into the Southern,
Western, and' Northern systems. The Southern stretches from Sydney
to Albury, on the frontier of Victoria, three hundred and eighty-six
miles; at J unee the South-western line branches from the Southern,
and runs to Hay, four hundred and fifty-four miles from Sydney, on
the Murrumbidgee River, and one of the most important towns in the
Rivcrina district. The Western line runs in the direction indicated by
its name, and terminates at Bourke, on the Darling River, five hundred
and three miles from Sydney. These are the longest railway-lines now
in operation in any part of Australia, though not equal to some that
are projected in Queensland and South Australia. The Northern line
extends to the frontier of Queensland, as already described.

In round figures, Australia has at present about ten thousand miles
of railway in operation, with another ten thousand miles--and perhaps
more--in contemplation. The completed lines have cost not less than
two hundred millions of dollars, and there are about thirty thousand
miles of telegraph in working order.

The up-country journey of our friends, in which they took part in a
kangaroo hunt and witnased a corroboree, was made over the Western
line. "\Ve have rarely seen finer engineering work on a railway any-
where else in the world than on this line," said Frank in his journal.
"It reminds us of the Brenner line over the Alps, the Central Pacific
in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the ride from Colombo to Kandy,
in Ceylon. It was an uninterrupted succession of magnificent views of
mountain scenery, with deep gorges and snowy water-falls at frequent
intervals. We advise those who may follow us to note particularly
the Katoomba and Wentworth Falls and Govett's Leap; and if they
have an interest in engineering, they will be much attracted by the
Lapstone Hill and Lithgow Valley Zigzags, where the railway climbs
the steep sides of the mountains. There is a. fine bridge over the
N epean River at Penrith, and a tunnel, called the Clarence, three thou-
sand seven hundred feet above sea-level, and five hundred and thirty-
eight yards in length."

There is also some fine engineering on the Southern line; and for aDIFFICUL'I' ENGINEERING WORK. 441

long time, when the railway was first proposed, many doubters predicted
that it would never be able to pass the Blue Mountains to the plains be
yond. The longest tunnel in Australia--five hundred and seventy-two
yards--is near Picton, on the Southern line; and the zigzags, bridges,
cuts, and fillings are well calculated to excite the admiration of the pro-
fessional railway man. As for the scenery, it fully justifies the praises
which Australians bestow upon it, and the ride over the Blue Mountains
is one that everybody who visits the country should take in the daytime.

The engineers of this line claim to have succeeded in solving a prob-
lem which has been pronounced impossible by many experienced men,
and has been tried elsewhere occasionally, and always with disastrous

results--that of having two trains pass each other on a single-track rail-
way. It is done in this way: At the end of each zigng there is a piece
of level track sufiiciently long to hold two trains. The engineer of a
descending train sees an ascending one on the zigzag below; he runs
his train out to the end of a level, and there waits until the ascending
one has entered the same level, reversed its course, and gone on its way
upward. One of the railway managers said to Doctor Bronson," There
isn't any double track here at all, and yet, you see, two trains can pass
each other without the least difficulty. The ends of our zigzags serve
as switches, that's all."

" You have no idea what a salubrious region this is," said one of the
passengers to whom they had been introduced by a friend who came to
see them off. "The air is wonderfully bracing, so much so that it is a.

common saying, 'Nobody ever dies in the Blue Mountains unless he is
killed by accident or blown away.' Many people live to more than a.
hundred years old; there is an authentic account of a man who cele-
brated his one hundred and tenth birthday six months before he died,
and another who was cut off by inteinperate habits when he was only
one hundred and one. This man used to speak of a. neighbor who lived
to be one hundred and eight years old and hadn't an unsound tooth in
his head, when he was killed by the kick of a, vicious horse."

The Blue Mountains are a. part of the great dividing range already
described in our account of the visit to Queensland. Of late years they
have rapidly grown in favor as a pleasure resort, and thousands of the
inhabitants of Sydney go there to escape the heat of summer. The
mountains increase in height as they approach the boundary between
New South Wales and Victoria, where they are known as the Austrar
lian Alps. The highest peak of all, Mount Kosciusko, is 7308 feet high,
and its summit. is covered with snow throughout the year.THE HEAD-STREAMS OF THE MURRAY RIVER. 443

Frank and Fred were at once seized with a. desire to visit Mount
Kosciusko, but were restrained by the Doctor, who did not share their
enthusiasm for mountain-climbing. So the youths contented themselves
with a distant view of the snowy tops of the high peaks of the range,
and allowed Mount Kosciusko to rest undisturbed. The country is wild
and picturesque, but the facilities for travel are not extensive, and only
those travellers who are accustomed to fatigue should undertake the

journey. The starting-point for the excursion is the littletown of Tum-
berumba, from which the mountains are about forty miles away. A
coach runs between Tumberumba and Calcairu, seventy-four miles, the
nearest point on the railway, and the town is said to be pleasantly situ-
ated at an elevation of two thousand feet above the sea.
The Murray River, which is sometimes called the I-Iume in the upper
part of its course, takes its rise at the foot of Mount Kosciusko and its
companion mountains. The scenery is quite Alpine in all its character-
istics, and well justifies the name which has been applied to this part of
the great chain. Deep gorges and precipitous cliffs enclose the head
streams of the Murray, and the forest extends far up the sides of the
mountains wherever there is sufficient soil for trees to find a place to
grow. Lower down there are considerable areas of open or cleared
country that have proved well adapted to agriculture. Wheat and cats
are profitably grown in the vicinity of Tumberumba; and in some parts
of the Albury district, in which Tumberumba is situated, tobacco is an
extensive crop. (See E'ontisjfiace.)

AtGoulburn, where they halted for the night, as previously arranged,
our friends found a well-built city of about eight thousand inhabitants,
and owing its prosperity to the large amount of inland trade which it
controls. Frank and Fred asked for the gold-mines of Goulburn, but
asked in vain; they were told that there were no goldfields in the
immediate vicinity, and that the city depended upon its commercial
position and the agricultural advantages of the surrounding region.
They were invited to visit some lime-burning establishments, and learned
that there were extensive quarries of limestone in the neighborhood, with
promising indications of silver, copper, and other metals, which as yet
are hardly developed.

In the evening the party witnessed a theatrical performance by a
strolling company, which was making the rounds of the interior towns
of Australia in the same way that American companies go " on the
road " during the dramatic season. The acting was good, and the com-
pany included several players who were not unknown in New York and
other American cities.

The youths had already noted the fact that Australia is a favorite
resort of members of thedramatic profession of England and the United
States; a considerable number of the men and women well known to
the foot-lights of English-Speaking countries have at one time or an-
other appeared on the boards of Melbourne and Sydney. Australians
are fond of the drama, and there are few cities in the world that can be
counted on for a more liberal patronage of good plays and good play-
ers, in proportion to their population, than the principal cities of the
great southern continent.

From one of the books in his possession Frank drew the following
interesting bit of theatrical history:AN INTERESTING PROLOGUE. 4-15

 

GALLERY OF A THEATRE DURING A PERFORMANCE.

"The first theatrical representation ever given in Australia. was at
Sydney, in 17 96. The play was ' The Ranger,' performed by a company
of amateurs, all of whom were convicts. The manager was also a. con-
vict. An admission fee of one shilling was demanded, and the Governor
and his stafl' were graciously invited to free seats. Coin being scarce
in the colony, a. shilling's worth of flour or rum was accepted in lieu of
money. The convict who played Filch recited the prologue, and was
probably its author. It mu as follows:

"'From distant lands. o'er wide-spread sens we come,
But not with much eelnt or bent of drum.
True palriots nll. for. be it understood,

We left our country for our country's good!
No privMe views disgraced our generous zeal:
What urged our trnvels was our conutry's wen],
And none can doubt but that our emigration
Hus proved most useful to the British untion.
He who to midnight ladders is no stranger,
You'll own will mnke an admirable Ranger;
To seek Macheath we have not far to room,
And sure in Filcb I shall be quite at home.
Here light and easy Columbines nre found,
And well-trained Harlequins with us abound;
From durance vile our precious selves to keep
We've often had to make a flying leap;

To a black face have sometimes owed escape,
And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crepe.
But how, you ask, can we e'er hope to soar
Above these scenes, and rise to tragic lore?
For oft, alas! we've forced lh' unwilling leer,
And petrified the heart with real fear.
Macbeth a harvest of applause will reap,

For some of us, I fear, have murdered sleep.
His Lady, too, with grace and ease will _talk--
Her blushes hiding 'neath a mine of chalk.
Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art,

An actor may improve and mend his'part.
"Give me a horse 1" hawls Richard, like a drone;
We'll show a man who'd help himself to one.
Grant us your favors, put us to the test;

To gain your smiles we'll do our very best;
And, without dread of future lnrnkey Lockils.

Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets."

The principal theatres of Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide will
compare favorably with those of any other city on the globe, and there
is hardly a town of any consequence at all that does not possess a minor
theatre or a hall where entertainments are given occasionally. During
the days of the gold rushes the mining regions proved more remunera~
tive to the strolling actors who visited them than to the majority of the
men who were digging for the precious metal.

The theatres of those days were often the rudest structures imagina-
ble, and not infrequently performances were given in tents, and some-
times in enclosures that were open to the sun and rain. It is said that
a performance of "Hamlet" was once given on an open-air stage in a
pouring rain. Ophelia wore a water-proof cloak, and in the last scene
in which she appeared she carried an umbrella. Polonius, being an old
man, was permitted to wear an Indiavrubber coat; but Hamlet's youth
did not permit such a protection from the weather, and when the play
ended he bore a close resemblance to the survivor of an inundation of
the Ohio valley, or a man rescued from a. shipwreck on the Atlantic
coast.

Beyond Goulhourn the railway carried our friends through the (lis-
trict of Riverina, famous for its pastoral and agricultural attractions.
At Albur ' they crossed the Murray River and entered the colony ofPROTECTION AND FREE--TRADE. 44-7

Victoria; a. change of gauge rendered a change of train necessary, and
Fred remarked that it seemed like crossing a frontier in Europe, the
resemblance being increased by the presence of the custom--house offi-
cials, who seek to prevent the admission of foreign goods into Victoria
until they have paid the duties assessed by law.

As before stated, Victoria has a protective tariff, while New South
Wales is a free-trade colony. Consequently, Victoria. is obliged to
guard her frontier to prevent smuggling, and the work of doing so ef-
fectively is by no means inexpensive. But she derives a large revenue
from the duty on imports, and the statesmen and others who favor
a protective tarifi can demonstrate by argument and illustration that

it is the principal cause of the prosperity of the colony. There is, of
course, a goodly number of free-traders in the colony, and the war
between freetradeis and protectionists is as vigorous and unrelenting
as in the United States or England.

The federation of all the Australian colonies, and their union under
a single government, on the same general plan as that which was adopt-
ed for the British--American provinces, has been for some time under
discussion; doubtless it might have been accomplished before this had
it not been for the opposition of New South Wales, which holds aloof
from the movement mainly on account of the tariff question. Feder-
ation will probably come before long; many Australians say it will be a.
step in the direction of independence, and they argue that a country so
far away from England can hardly be expected to retain its allegiance
to the mother-country forever, in view of its growing power and popu-
lation, its diversity of interests, and the perils to which it would be sub--
ject in case of a. European war in which England should be concerned.

The railway from Melbourne reached Wodonga, opposite Albury, in
1873, but the line from Sydney was not completed till 1881. From that
time till 1884 there was a break of three miles which passengers trav-
ersed by coach or on foot; in the year last named the connection was
completed by the construction of an iron bridge over the Murray, and
the closing of the gap with tracks adapted to the gauges of both the
colonies. There are now commodious stations on both sides of the
river. The New South Wales trains cross the river to Wodonga, while
those from Victoria cross it to Albury. '

It was evening when the party arrived at the frontier, and as soon
as the formalities of the custom-house were over, the Doctor and his
young companions went to a hotel near the station. The custom-house
was not rigorous, as none of their baggage was opened, the officials be-
in,SS.,r contented with the declaration that they had nothing dutiahle in
their possession. Next morning the youths were up early to have a
look at the great river of Australia; they were somewhat disappoint
ed with the Murray, their fancies having made the river much larger
than it proved to be. Compared with the Mississippi, the Hudson, the
Rhine, or the Thames, it was insignificant, but it was nevertheless a
river navigable from Albury to the ocean, one thousand eight hundred
miles away.

A steamboat lay at the bank of the river a short distance below
the railway-bridge; it was_not much of a boat in the way of luxury,
but was well adapted to the work for which it was intended, and had a
barge fastenedbehind it by a strong tow-rope. Fred learned that there
were several boats engaged in the navigation of the Murray and its
tributaries, but they were unable to run at all seasons of the year. In
ordinary stages of water boats can reach Albury, but there are certain
periods of the year when they cannot do so.

Some boys were sitting on the bank farther down the river, en-
gaged in fishing with pole and line. Frank and Fred made their ac
quaintance, and examined the fish they had taken; the oldest of the
boys, evidently much more intelligent than his companions, enlightened
the strangers as to the piscatorial possessions of Australia.2+

FISH-MATCHING BOXES ON A SMALL STRKAM.

" That is the ' Murray cod,' or ' cod-perch,' " said he,as he pointed to
one of the results of the morning's work. I

" What a splendid fish!" Fred exclaimed.

" What 2--thz1t !" said the Australian youth, with an air of contempt.
" That's only a, little one, and doesn't weigh more'n two pounds."

" How large do these fish grow 2" queried Frank.

l" Oh! we catch 'em weighing thirty or forty pounds," was the re-
ply. " We bait with treefrogs, and have to use strong lines, or they'd
get away from us."

"They're pretty good eating," he continued, "but not so good as
bream and trout; the trout were brought here from your country, and
we're getting 'em all through the rivers of Australia, so folks tell me.
They sent us the eggs, and the fish were hatched out here; and several
kinds of European and American fishes have been introduced that way.
We've a good many kinds of perch; how many I don't know, but the
best is the golden perch of the Murray and the rivers running into it.
VVe've got a. black-fish, as we call him; he's black outside, but his flesh
is white as snow, and he's splendid for eating.

" If you want to go trout-fishing, you can do so twenty miles from
Melbourne and find all you want; they've been trying to raise salmon
in Australigt, but the rivers are too warm for 'em. Sometimes we read

in the newspapers about somebody's catching a. salmon, but it never
amounts to much."ARRIVAL AT MELBOURNE. 451

Frank presented his informant with a, shilling, partly in return for
his information and partly to secure the fish, which he carried to the
hotel and requested that it be cooked for breakfast. It was cooked
accordingly, and when, accompanied by the Doctor, the youths sat down
to their repast, the fish was pronounced a toothsome morsel.

Soon after ten o'clock they were in the railway-train for Melbourne.
They traversed a varied country, passing through a rich pastoral and
agricultural region, through widely extended wheat-fields, and in sight
of numerous flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, through stretches of
forest more or less luxuriant, over plains and among hills, along wind-
ing valleys, and occasionally in sight of the mountains which lie be-
tween the Dividing Range and some portions of the coast. In due
time the crest of the range was passed, and the train descended gently
to Melbourne and deposited the travellers safe and sound at the rail-
way terminus. '

B'RANK and Fred were impatient to see Melbourne, the city of

which they had heard so much, and whose praises are loudly
chanted by every resident of the colony of Victoria. As they rode
from the railway-station to their hotel they could hardly believe that
they were in a. city where half a century ago there was little more than
a, clearing in the forest on the banks of the Yarra.

Yet so it was. On June 2, 1835, John Batman ascended the Yarra
and Saltwater rivers, and made a bargain with the native chiefs of the
locality to purchase a. large area of ground, more than one thousand
two hundred square miles, for which he paid a few shirts and blankets,
some sugar, flour, and other trifles--probably not a. hundred (lollars'
worth altogether. The Government afterwards set aside his purchase,
but paid to Batman and his partners the sum of PS7000 for the relin-
quishment of their claim.

Batman returned immediately to Tasmania to procure a fresh sup-
ply of provisions, and near the end of August, 1835, during his absence,
another adventurer, John Fawkner, landed on the banks of the Yarra
from the schooner Enterprise, and made his camp in the forest on the
bank of the stream. He brought five men, two horses, two pigs, one
cat, and three kangaroodogs; and this was the colony that founded
the present city of Melbourne. Fawkner may be fairly considered the
founder of Melbourne, as the permanent occupation of the site datesTHE FOUNDERS OF MELBOURNE. 453

 

 

ms muxnlxe or murmur-'3, AUGUST, 1885.

from the day he landed from his schooner. But Batman's part of the
affair should not be forgotten; he returned in the following April, and
settled on what is now a. part of the city. As might be expected, there
was a. bitter quarrel between Batman and Fawkner as long as both sur-
vived, and it was continued by their descendants.

The inhabitants of Melbourne have duly honored Batman by erect-
ing in the old cemetery of that city an appropriate monument to his
memory. He died in 1839, before the city had grown to much impor-
tance though it was giving good promise for the future. At the time
of Batman's death there were four hundred and fifty houses, seventy
shops, and three thousand inhabitants in Melbourne, and the first ship
had sailed for London with a. cargo of four hundred bales of wool.

Frank and Fred learned all this before taking their first stroll along
the streets of Melbourne on the morning after their arrival. They also
learned that the city took its name in honor of Lord Melbourne, who

was then Premier of Great Britain.

Frank suggested that perhaps

returns," since a great many
deaths occurred there during
the gold rush. Fred reproved
his cousin for using this anti-
quated " chestnut," and the top.
ic was indefinitely postponed.
The first thing to attract
the attention of the youths
was the width of the streets
(ninety-nine feet, or a chain
and a half) in contrast with
the narrow streets of Sydney.
Then the situation is pleasing,
as it is on some rolling hills
something like those on which
Moscow, the ancient capital of
Russia, stands. The hills af-
ford good drainage to the cen--
tral part of the city, and as
one goes about he finds him-
self occasionally upon an ele-
vation from which he can look
away for a considerable dis-
tance. The city itself is about
a mile and a half square, and
is regularly laid out; it is sur-
rounded by parks and gardens,
and its suburbs include a rar
dius of not far from ten miles,
and are steadily extending.
Within this radius it is claimed
that there are fully 360,000 in-
habitants, and the number is
increasing year by year.

"Three hundred and sixty thousand people in a city which was first
settled in 1835!" said Fred. "Chicago and San Francisco must look

sharp for their laurels."
"They may look, but they won't find them," replied Frank.

"Are you not mistaken 2" queried his cousin,\ "Did not each of
them have as many inhabitants as Melbourne within fifty years after its
settlement t"

"We will see," was the reply. " Chicago was practically founded in
1816, when Fort Dearborn, which had been destroyed in 1812, was re-
built. In 1870, fifty-four years later, it had, according to the census,
298,997 inhabitants.

 

)lSLBOURNR POST-ON'ICB.

" San Francisco was begun in 1776, when the Mission of San Fran-
cisco de Asis, more commonly called the Mission Dolores, was estab-
lished there; but some people claim that the city was not really
founded until 1835, when the village of Yerba Buena. was built, and to
please them we'll start from that date, which is the year in which Mel-
bourne was founded. By the census of 1880, forty-five years from its
foundation, it had 233,959 inhabitants, and at its fiftieth anniversary
was doubtless considerably behind Melbourne. But Chicago has gone
ahead of both of the other cities in question, as it contained more than
half a million people in 1880, and was still growing as fast as the exten-
sions on the prairie would permit. Perhaps in time it will cover the

whole State of Illinois."

world in their growth," responded
Fred, "and they've no reason to
be jealous of one another." Frank
echoed this opinion, and then the
figures of populations were dropped
from discussion.

Their walk took them along 001-
lins Street, which is the Broadway
or the Regent Street of the city;
they traversed its entire length from
west to east, and then turned their

attention to Bourke Street, which

runs parallel to Collins Street. To
enumerate all the fine buildings they
saw in their promenade would make
a. list altogether too tedious for any-
thing less than a guide-book. As
they took no notes of what they
saw, it is safe to say that neither
of the youths could at this moment
write a. connected account of the
sights of the morning.

" If we had been skeptical about
the wealth and prosperity of Mel-
bourne," wrote Fred in his journal,
"all our doubts were removed by
what we saw during our first tour
through the city. One after another
magnificent piles of buildings came
before us, the banks and other pri-
vate edifices rivalling the public ones
for extent and solidity. The high--

est structure in Melbourne is known as Robb's Buildings, and was built
by a wealthy speculator, on the same general plan as the Mills, Field,
and similar buildings in New York. There are many banks, ofiice build--
ings, stores, warehouses, and other private edifices that would do honorA STROLL THROUGH MELBOURNE. 4:57

to London, Paris, or New York; and the same is the case with the
Post-office, Houses of Parliament, Law Courts, Public Library, National
Gallery, Government House, Ormond College, and other public struct-
ures.

"We turned down Swanston Street in the direction of the river, the
Yarra, or, to speak more properly, the YarrarYarra, as it was originally
known, though few now call it by the double name. Anybody who
comes here expecting a. great river will be disappointed, as the Yarra
isn't much of a stream on which to build a city like Melbourne. It
answers well enough for people to row upon with pleasureboats and for
occasionally drowning somebody, but is altogether too small and shal-
low for large vessels. Steamers and sailing--craft drawing not more
than sixteen feet can come up to the city, but large vessels must stop
at Sandridge, or Port Melbourne, two and a. half miles away. The Yarra.
supplies water for the Botanical Gardens, but not for the city generally.

 

counts smear xx 1870.

"We reached the river at Prince's Bridge, where a fine viaduct of
three arches replaces the former one of a single arch. There are several
bridges across the Yarra, which separates Melbourne proper from South
Melbourne and other suburbs, and we were told that new bridges are
under consideration, and will be built as the necessity for them becomes
more pressing. A great deal of money has been expended in deepening
and straightening the river, and it is certainly vastly improved upon
the stream which Batman and Fawkner ascended in 1835, when they
made the settlements from which Melbourne has grown. Since 1877
the river has been deepened three feet, and the minimum low-water
depth is said to be fourteen feet six inches at spring-tides.

 

 

PUI'KHG ("PICKS AND TREASURY GARDRNSi

" Streetcars, or 'trams,' some drawn by horses and others by cables,
run in every direction; and there are omnibuses, cabs, and other con--
veyzmces; so that one can go pretty nearly anywhere he chooses for
a small amount of money. Some of the omnibnses remind us of the
new ones in Paris, as they have three horses abreast, and dash along in
fine style. I-Iansom and other cabs are numerous, and the fares are
about a third more than in London; this is a great change from the
days of the gold rush, when the most ordinary earriage could not be
hired for less than PS3 a. day, and very often the drivers obtained twiceIN THE "BOOK ARCADE." 459

or three times that amount. We have been told of a. gold-digger just
down from the mines of whom PS12 was demanded one day for an after-
noon's drive; he handed the driver a. ten-pound note, and told him he
would have to be satisfied with that--and he was.

" We went into three or four arcades, which form pleasant lounging
and shopping places, like the famous ' passages ' of Paris and the arcades
of London. One of them is called the 'Book Arcade,' and is principally
devoted to the sale of books; and if we may judge by the number of
volumes we saw there, the people of Melbourne are liberal patrons of

literature. No matter what the taste of a. person might be in books,
whether he desired a work of fiction or a, treatise on science, a, volume
of travels or an exposition of Hindoo philosophy, he could be accom-
modated Without delay. They have a public library here containing-
nearly one hundred and fifty thousand volumes, all of which can be
read without charge.
" When we got back to the hotel and met the Doctor, it was time
to sit down to breakfast. He had already received two invitations to
dinner from gentlemen to whom he brought letters; they had heard of
our arrival, and knowing we had been hospitably received in Sydney,
were determined that we should be initiated at once into the courtesies
of Melbourne, and start off with a favorable impression of the place.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new nu>>: scum nstsocnxs, 1868.

"A few minutes after we were through with breakfast a gentle-
man called for us and gave us a carriage-drive, in which we saw
more than we can begin to describe. We visited the Botanical Gar-
(lens, which are about a mile from the city, and on the south bank of
the Yarra; they cover an area of not far from a hundred acres, and do
great credit to the gentlemen who designed and perfected them. The
collection of plants and trees is very large, and everything is labelled,
so that the scientific student can know at once its history and charac-
ter. We strolled along a winding walk among the ferns, and could
easily imagine ourselves in the heart of a tropical forest. We also vis-
ited the Fitzroy, Carlton, Treasury, and other gardens and parks, of
which Melbourne has an abundant supply.

" On many of the streets trees have been planted, and they add much
to the attractions of the city. The water-supply of Melbourne comes
from an artificial lake nineteen miles from the city, and is brought inCHURCHES AND RELIGIONS IN VICTORIA. 461

by the Yan Yean Water-works, which are not altogether unlike the
Croton works of New York or the Cochituate of Boston. Water seems
to be abundant in all the houses, and we are told that there are more
bath-tubs in Melbourne than in any other city of its size in the world.

"We can't begin to name all the churches we have seen in our rides
and walks along the streets. Suffice it to say there are no finer modern
churches anywhele than here, and the inhabitants of Melbourne have
shown great liberality in their contributions for building these religious
edifices. There is no State Church in the colony, but the Church of
England is the fashionable one, and has a. greater number of adherents
than any other church.

" In their order, and omitting the smaller figures, there were by the
last census of the colony 311,000 Episcopalians, 203,000 Catholics, 132,000
Presbyterians, 108,000 Methodists, 20,000 Independents, or Congregation-
alists, 20,000 Baptists, and 11,000 Lutherans and German Protestants.

 

mm or "woven IN 1888.

On the first of January, 1886, there were 2150 churches and chapels in
Victoria, and about the same number of public buildings and dwellings
used for public worship, or more than 4000 in all.

" While we were riding about the city we asked our host whence

came the names of the streets.
"' The principal ones commemorate men who were connected with
the early history of the colony,' was his reply. 'Collins Street is
named for Colonel Collins, who established a convict settlement on the
shores of Port Phillip Bay in 1803, but soon gave it up and removed the
settlement to Tasmania. Bourke Street is named after the governor of
New South Wales in 1836; Flinders Street after Captain Fliuders, of
whose explorations you are doubtless aware; Lonsdale Street after
Captain Lonsdale, who was in command here about that time; and
Swanston Street after one of Batman's companions. King, Queen,
William, and Elizabeth Streets are tokens of Our loyalty to the royal
family of Great Britain, the same as are the streets of like names in
Sydney and Brisbane.'

" I should have said, in speaking of the streets, that between every
two wide streets there are narrow ones which were originally intended
as back entrances, and were known by the prefix of 'little.' Thus we
have Little Collins Street between Collins and Bourke Streets; Little
Bourke Street between Bourke and Latrobe, and so on through the
list. Most of these 'little' streets have become known as lanes, and
are spoken of as Collins Lane, Bourke Lane, etc. Bourke Lane is
largely occupied by Chinese, and Flinders Lane, between Flinders and
Collins Street-s, is generally known as ' The Lane,' especially among the
dealers in clothing throughout Australia, as it is the peculiar haunt of
the importers of wearing apparel, or ' soft goods.'

"Elizabeth Street runs in the valley between the two principal hills
on which the city is built, and divides it into East and West, just as
Fifth Avenue divides the numbered streets of New York. As Mel-
bourne is on the other side of the world from New York, it is quite in
the nature of things that the custom of designating the portions of a
street should be the reverse of ours. In New York we say ' East Four-
teenth Street,' or 'West Twenty-third Street.' Here they say 'Collins
Street East,' or 'Bourke Street West,' according as the designated
locality is east or west from Elizabeth Street.

"We returned to the hotel in good season to dress for dinner,"
continued Fred, "and at the appointed time went to the place where
we were to dine. It was several miles out of town, and our journey
thither was by railway, our host sending a carriage to meet us at the
station. Melbourne resembles London in having a network of sub-
urban railways, and resembles it further in having a great rush of
people to the city in the morning, and out of it in the afternoon. Or-

dinarily the facilities of travel are fairly equal to the demand, but if
a heavy shower of rain falls about 6 PAL, the supply of vehicles is in-
suflicient.

" The house of our host is well built and well furnished, and has
plenty of ground surrounding it for garden, lawn, and shrubbery.
English trees grow in the grounds. Much of the furniture came from
the old countr , but the portion of it that was made in Melbourne is by
no means inferior to the imported part. Prosperous people in Mel-
bourne know how to live well, and some of the wealthier inhabitants
spend a. great deal of money on the support of their establishments.

 

A SUBURBAN RESIDENCE.

We dined as well as we could have dined in London or New York, the
local luxuries of those cities that were wanting here being fully atoned
for by the products of the colony.

"It was late in the evening when we got back to our hotel in the
city, after listening to stories of colonial life in general, and of life in
Melbourne in particular, until our heads were nearly giddy with what
had been poured into them. Anthony Trollope intimates that the Mel-
bournitfi are given to 'blowing' about the wonders of their city, and
he excuses them on the ground that they have something worth ' blow-
ing' about. If we were to make any remark on this subject, it would
be to agree with him on both points. But as one hears the same kind
of talk in Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco, and other American cities,
and also in the other colonial centres of Australasia, we have ceased to
wonder at it, and set it down as a matter of course."

In the next day. or two our friends visited some of the suburbs of
Melbourne, including Notham, Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Bruns-
wick on the north, and Richmond, Prahran, Windsor, Malvern, and Caul-
field on the south. Frank noted that some of these suburbs were pros-
perous and well populated, while others were much less so, and seemed
to base a goodly part of their hopes on the future. There is a great
deal of speculation in suburban land, just as in the neighborhood of all
large cities the world over; fortunes have been made in suburban spec
ulation, and still larger fortunes hoped for but not yet realized.

Melbourne was originally laid out in half-acre lots, but nearly all of
them have long since been divided and subdivided. One of the few
that have not been divided, but are held by the families of the pur-
chasers, is in a good part of Collins Street. The oolonist who bought it
paid PS20 for the lot in 1837; it is now worth PS100,000, and since the
time of the original purchase the holders have received at least PS100,000
in rents. One million dollars in fifty years from an investment of one
hundred dollars may be considered a fairly good return for--one's money.

Doctor Bronson and his nephews were not neglectful of the harbor
of Melbourne any more than they had been of Sydney Cove when at
the capital of New South Wales. There are trains at short intervals
from Melbourne to Sandridge (Port Melbourne), and cars and omni-
buses every fifteen minutes. The fare is threepence, or six cents. This
is a great reduction from the days of the gold rush in 1851, when the
omnibus charge between Sandridge and Melbourne was two shillings
and Sixpence (sixty-two and one-half cents) for each passenger, and a.
carriage for four persons cost from five to twenty dollars for the
single trip.

Mr. Manson, who was so attentive to our friends in Sydney, was
equally well acquainted with Melbourne; he called upon them shortly
after their arrival in the latter city, and proposed to accompany them
in their visit to the port. I-Iis offer was at once accepted. During the
ride to Sandridge the conversation turned upon the days of the gold
rush, and the incidents that long since passed into history.

many old residents that I have no doubt of their correctness. The ex-
pense-of getting goods from Sandridge to Melbourne, three miles, was
often as much as to bring them from London to the harbor. William
Howitt tells, in his 'Two Years in Victoria,' that the cost of carrying
his baggage from the ship to his lodgings in Melbourne was more than
that of bringing them the previous thirteen thorisand miles, including
what he paid for conveyance from his house to the London docks.

 

HARBOR SGRNB [N m MOONLIGHT.

" When a ship arrived with passengers, the charge for taking them
from the anchorage to the beach was three shillings, and then came the
omnibus charge already mentioned. If e man was alone, the boatinen
charged him ten or perhaps twenty shillings; and if a. person was
obliged to go out to a ship, and they knew his journey was important,
they would charge any price they pleased. A gentleman having 0003/-
sion to visit a. ship that was about to sail, and manifesting some anxiety
to do so, was obliged to pay PS12, or sixty dollars.

" After goods were landed they were loaded into carts for transpor-
tation to Melbourne. A clerk looked at a load, and then said, glibly,
'These things will be PS3 ;' and if anybody demurred at the price, the
gate-keeper was ordered not to let the cart pass out of-the yard till

30
the sum demanded was paid. People grumbled and denounced the
charges as outrageous, but they generally paid them and went on.

" In the city the same high scale of prices prevailed. In the shops
the prices were about three hundred per cent. above the cost of goods.

Lodgings were in great demand; the meanest kind of an unfurnished
room was worth ten dollars a week, and two poorly furnished ones were
from twenty to thirty dollars a week. Hotel-keepers turned their sta-
bles into sleeping-places, and a man paid five shillings a night for a.
third of a horse's stall, good straw, a blanket, and a rug. One landlord
had seventy of these five-shilling lodgers in'his stable nightly, in addi-
tion to the occupants of the rooms in the legitimate portion of his
house." ' ' ~ ,

" I wonder the people didn't live in tents till they could arrange to
go up country," one of the youths remarked.

"They did so," was the reply, " and so many tents were spread on
the waste ground outside the city that the place became known as Can-
vas Town. The Government charged five shillings weekly for the priv-
ilege of putting up tents on this waste ground, or at the rate of sixty
dollars a year. Of course all were anxious to get away as soon as pos-
sible, but they were often detained three or four weeks, or even longer,
waiting to obtain their goods from the ships." .

"Was there much security for life and property in those days?"
Frank asked.ROBBING A SHIP IN HARBOR. 467

"According to all accounts there was a. great deal of disorder," Mr.
Manson responded. " There were many runaway convicts here from Tas-
mania. and New South Wales, together with other bad characters. Rob-
beries along the road were very common. One Saturday afternoon in
broad daylight four fellows armed with guns and pistols stopped some
twenty or more people, one after the other, tied them up to trees, and
robbed them, on the road from Melbourne to St. Kilda. The bush-
langers carried on their performances up to the very edge of Melbourne,
and sometimes they rode through the streets and out again before they
could be stopped.

" The coolest piece of robbery was performed in the harbor one
night. A ship was to sail for England at daylight, and she had several
thousand ounces of gold on board. About midnight a party of eight or
ten went out in a boat pretending to have business on board, and were
admitted without suspicion. Their real business was to plunder the
ship, and they succeeded; they 'stuck up' the officeis and crew, bound
them hand and foot, loaded the gold into their boat, and escaped. No
alarm was given until some one went on board the next morning, as all
the oflicers and crew had been gagged and locked in below. The rob-
bers got clean away; nothing was
ever learned about them, but it
was suspected that they were ex-
convicts from Tasmania."

The carriage had by this time
brought our friends to Sandridge,
and they alighted at the head of
one of the piers. There are two
piers at Sandridge (to use its for-
mer name in place of its more
modern appellation of Port Mel-
bourne). These piers run far out
into the bay, and ships of almost
any tonnage may lie alongside to
discharge or receive cargoes. One A 0001) memos m nusmnss.
is known as the town pier, and the
other as the railway pier; on the railway pier trains of cars may load
or discharge, at the side of the ships, and thus effect a great saving in
the'handling of freight.

It was a busy scene from one end of the pier to the other, and as the
strangers walked about they were obliged to be cautious lest they were
run over by moving cars or stumbled among the piles of goods that lay
about. Vessels from all parts of the world were lying at the piers; at
anchor in the bay were other vessels, steamers and sailing craft, like-
wise hailing from the four quarters of the globe. All the great com-
panies known in the East, the "P. and 0.," North German Lloyds,
Messageries Maritimes, Orient, and others, were represented, and the
ubiquitous "tramp " steamers were there
in goodly numbers. Then there were
numerous "intereolonia-l" steamers en-
gaged in the trade between Melbourne
and the ports of the Australian coast,
and also with Tasmania, New Zealand,
Feejee, and other islands.

   
 
 
  

LOADING A SHIP PROM A LIGHTER.

Some of the steamships have their (looks at Williamstown, which is
on the other side of Hobson's Bey, directly opposite Sandridge, and
connected with Melbourne by railway. The business of VVilliamstown,
like that of Sandridge, is mostly connected with the shipping; a. steam
ferry carried our friends across the bay, and they spent an hour or two
in Williamstown, the time being principally devoted to an inspection ofsr. KILDA, THE (:0an ISLAND or MELBOURNE. 469

the ship-building yards and the graving dock, which has accommoda-
tions for the largest ships engaged in the Australian trade.

Robson's Bay may be called the enlarging of the Yarra at its mouth,
or the narrowing of Port Phillip Bay at its head. But by whatever
description it is known it is an excellent harbor for Melbourne, as it has
good anchorage and abundance of space for the ships that congregate
there. Port Phillip Bay is about thirty-five miles long and the same in
width; its entrance is nearly two miles across, and, like Sydney harbor,
it has space for all the navies of the civilized world. N o doubt the Mel-
bourne people would not object to such a visitation, provided it were
peaceful, for the same reason that the Sydneyite gave to Frank and
Fred, "that it would be a good thing for business."

On their return from Williamstown to Sandridge the party drove to
St. Kilda, the Coney Island of Melbourne, and a great resort for those
who are fond of salt-water bathing. Farther down the bay is Brighton
Beach, a familiar name whether the visitor be from New York or Lon-
don, and if he looks further he will find other names that will not
be altogether strange. All around the bay there are pleasure resorts,
private residences, business establishments, factories, and other evidences
that the region has long since been reclaimed from the possession of the
savage and become the permanent home of the white man.

Fred observed that there were fences far out in the water enclosing
areas where bathers were splashing and, to all appearances, having a
good time. He immediately asked what was the use of the fences.

"They are for protection against sharks," replied Mr. Manson,
"which are abundant in these waters and all along the Australian
coast. You have doubtless heard'of them at other points."

The youth remembered the sharks at Queensland and New South
Wales, and the stories he had heard about them. He remarked that if
the creatures were as bad as they were farther north, he should not
venture into the water at St. Kilda until satisfied that the fence was
thoroughly shark proof.

The carriage was sent back from St. Kilda, and on assurance that
the fence was strong the whole part): indulged' in the luxury of a sea-
bath. Then they strolled on the beach, dined at one of the restaurants
for which St. Kilda is famous, and returned in the evening by railway
to Melbourne. Frank and Fred thought it was very like an excursion
to Coney Island, and Doctor Bronson fully agreed with them, except
that he missed the broad ocean which spreads before the popular water-
ing-place of New York.
"There's a fine watering-place at Queenscliflz', at the entrance of
Port Phillip Bay," said Mr. Manson, " where you can look out on the
Pacific and can see and hear the surf breaking on the shore. There's a
fort there to guard the entrance in case of war, and all ships are sig-
nalled from that point on their arrival. As St. Kilda is the Coney
Island of Melbourne, Queensclifi may be called its Long Branch, as its
distance is about thirty-two miles, and it can be reached both by railway
and steamboat. '

"Farther down the coast," said he, "there are other watering--places,
and what with the mountains and the sea Melbourneites are well pro-
vided with retreats. Here is something interesting."

As he spoke he took from his pocket a photograph, which Doctor
Bronson examined attentively, and then passed it over to the youths. It
represented some rocks which resembled pieces of artillery, and were
overlooked by a head that reminded Frank of "The Old Man of the
Mountain," in Franconia, New Hampshire.

" The height to the crown of the head," said Mr. Manson, "is twen-
ty-four feet, and the tuft of coast scrub that has found sufficient soil to
cling to it in the cleft of the rock increases the resemblance to a head
by representing hair. The guns are more realistic when viewed from
another angle; near them are some spherical blocks of sandstone that
might almost serve as cannon-balls. The head has been named the
' Sentinel,' and is also called the Sphinx; it is on the southern coast of
Victoria, and about eight miles from Lorne, which has a growing popu-
larity as a watering-place. The rocks resembling cannon are known as
' The Artillery Rocks.' "

Frank and Fred hoped they would have an opportunity to visit this
natural curiosity, but circumstances did not favor them, as Lorne was
too far away from the route of travel to justify the detour.

The day after their visit to St. Kilda they were taken on a steam-
boat excursion to Geelong, a pretty and well-built city on the shores of
an arm of Port Phillip Bay, and about forty-five miles from Melbourne.
It is famous for its woollen mills, tanneries, and other manufactories,
and at one time its inhabitants firmly believed that it would be a suc-
cessful rival of Melbourne on account of the superior advantages of its
harbor and its greater nearness to the ocean.

It is said that the Geelong people caused a railway to be built be-
tween that city and Melbourne in the expectation that all the wool
shipped at Melbourne would be brought to their city, which would also
be the landing-place of all the goods destined for Melbourne. The reNEWSPAPERS 0F MELBOURNE. 471

sult. was exactly the reverse, the railway serving to take from Geelong
most of the foreign trade it already possessed and carry it to Mel-
bourne. Cargoes of .wool are shipped from there still, but they are few
in number when compared with those from Melbourne.

 

THE AflTlI'LERY ROCKS, NEAR LORNL', ON YIIB COAST OF VICTOIIIA.

Before the mail closed for America, Frank and Fred busied them-
selves with a, large number of papers, which they sent to friends at
home. They included the Aye and the Argus, dailies which reminded
them of The London Times or Daily 1Vews, T In; Illustrated Austrah'a/n
.News and The Illustrated Sketoher, pictorials making their appearance
monthly, 2), dozen or more weekly and monthly papers, some of them of
Brobdingnagian proportions, and representing all shades of religious,
social, and political feeling, and a. quarterly called 17w Imperial Review;

Melbourne Age at the invitation of one of its proprietors, and had

had a. just appreciation of the journalistic skill and enterprise of the
antipodes. ' '

" The weekly edition of the Age is called the leader," said Frank, in
his letter, " and there isn't a. daily paper in the United States that has a
weekly edition to rival it in size, quantity, and variety of matter; and
the same may be said of the Australasian, which is the weekly edition of
the Argus. The Leader for this week, of which I send you a. copy, con-
tains forty-eight pages, and they tell me this is the regulation number.
The pages are the size of those of Hume's WEEKLY, and are filled with
whatever is considered of greatest interest to their readers in the coun-
try districts.

"It is evident," continued Frenk,"that there are many Waifs and '
strays in the population of Australia, if we are to judge by the advertis-
ing columns of the newspapers. All the leading dailies have adver-THE "MISSING FRIENDS' " COLUMN. ' 4:73

" E'RE sorry you are not to be here for the Cup Race," was re-
marked to our friends by half the acquaintances they made in
Melbourne. " It's the greatest day in the southern hemisphere," said
one of them, " and is to Australia. what the Derby Day is to England.
Banks, stores, courts, legislative councils, and all other places of business
are closed on that occasion, and the whole population takes a. holiday."

The race for the Melbourne Cup is the sporting sensation of Aus--
tralia, and it is said that nearly two hundred thousand people assemble
to witness it. The city and suburbs furnish a large part of the attend-
ance, and the rest is made up from the country regions, from the other
colonies of the continent, and not a. few visitors from New Zealand and
Tasmania. For weeks--and, one may say, for nionths--precexling the
event it is the principal topic of conversation, and the stranger is often
surprised at the prevalence of "horse talk" in the best social circles.
For a. week before the memorable (lay the city is crowded with stran--
gers, and the oft-repeated question, "Which horse will win the cup 2" is
heard everywhere and from every lip.

The first Tuesday of November is Cup Day, and the race may be
considered one of the harbingers of spring. Every available convey-
ance IS in requisition, vehicles of all kinds rent for high prices, the rail-
ways run frequent trains, and many thousands of spectators go andFLEIII NGTON RACE-TRACK.

return on foot. The race-course is at Flemington, three miles from
Melbourne; it covers three hundred and sixteen acres of ground, and is
considered one of the finest racing-tracks in the world. From the
grand-stand the towers and spires of Melbourne are distinctly visible:
the whole track lies directly in front, and altogether the scene, as the
horses come in at the finish, is one long to be remembered.

Horses from all the colonies may compete for the cup. It is a curi-
ous circumstance that of all the competitors for the Melbourne Cup in
1887 not one was bred in the colony of Victoria. '

Though Doctor Bronson and the youths were not in Melbourne at the
right time for the cup race, they had abundant opportunity to witness
games of cricket, the sport for which the Victorians are famous. The

game is universally popular in the colony; in and near Melbourne there
are two or three cricket--grounds splendidly equipped with everything
that players or spectators could desire, and when notable games are
played they are sure to draw large crowds. The interior cities and
towns have their cricket-grounds, and every vacant lot in Melbourne
large enough for a game is the resort of " larrikins" and other youths,
from seven years old and upwards, all intent upon cricket. In fact, the
game is to Australia what base-ball is to America.

The "Australian Eleven," and its successful competition with the
"All-England Eleven" and other British clubs, is too well-known to
cricket-players to require more than passing mention. It is no moreN LARRlKlNS." 47 7

players of the world.

The " larrikin " of Australia, mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
is the equivalent for the "street arab" of New York and the "young
hoodlum" of San Francisco--a youth who is subject to no parental
restraint, and all too often is without any place he can call home. Under
these circumstances he is very apt to drift into vicious ways, and gives
the police a good deal of trouble. When Frank first heard the word
" larrikin," and heard its meaning, he naturally asked for its origin.

"Nobody knows positively," was the reply. "The story goes that
years ago a. policeman arrested a boy whom he had caught in seine
violation of the law. When called to testify against the young culprit
the policeman, who was a native of Dublin, gravely said,

" 'I caught him, yer honor, a larrikin (larking) around and making
a dale of noise.'

"From that time to this, so the story goes, the turbulent youth of
Australian cities and towns have been known as 'larrikins.' Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, and all other large places in the colonies are plen-
tifully supplied with them."
" Melbourne was determined, as I've said before," wrote Frank, " not
to be outdone by Sydney in hospitality, and it certainly wasn't. We
have had invitations that would require weeks and months to accept
them. Everybody has made us welcome, not only to their houses here
but at the seaside and Lip-country. Doctor Bronson received cards for
all the clubs, and in a good many ways we have had 'the freedom of
the city.' There are several fine clubs here--among them the Athena:-
um, the Australian, the Melbourne, and the Yorick, the last'being semi-
professional in its character, like the Lotos of New York. In fact, it
has an exchange with the Lotos, members of either club having the
privileges of the other without charge for a period of three months.

"Many of the private houses have ball-rooms attached, and dancing-
parties are very common in fashionable life. A favorite social amuse-
ment is lawn-tennis, and I don't think there is any place in the world
where it has greater popularity. It is played by old and young of both
sexes, and many of the young ladies in society devote three or four
hours daily to the sport. We were invited one day to accompany a
gentleman on a round of afternoon calls. The calls amounted to visit--
ing six or eight tennisvcourts in succession, and in each court we found
a goodly-sized party, some of the ladies and gentlemen playing as
though their lives depended on winning, and the rest drinking tea, chat-
ting, and looking on.

"When the heat of summer comes on those who have country--
houses, eithei by the sea or on the mountains, retire there, just as New
Yorkers run away to Long Branch, Newport, or the White Mountains.
Some of the owners of country-houses keep them open throughout the
year, and are never contented unless they have a party of guests to
accept their hospitality. We were invited to several of these houses,
but time prevented our accepting all the invitations. We ran up for a
few days to a rural retreat on the southern slope of one of the moun-
tains that looks upon Melbourne from a distance of forty or fifty miles
The place and all its appointments were delightful.

"The house stands in a broad clearing in the gum forest, and in a
position commanding an extensive view. To the rear and on each side
the wood--covered slopes rise above it, but in front there is a view along
the gently descending plains to Melbourne and the ocean beyond.
Though the city is nearly fifty miles away we can clearly make out its
position on a fine day, so great is the purity of the atmosphere. When
the air is a trifle murky we see in place of Melbourne a cloud of smoke,
which the Winds bear away, sometimes to the north and sometimes toIN THE MOU'STMRS 1"! SUMMER. 479

the south or east. Port Phillip Bay shines between the city and the
ocean, and with a, glass we can trace the course of the steamers as they
enter or leave the great haven or creep along the coast.

"Immediately in front of the house the lawn sweeps down to a
pretty pond or tiny lake, and around it is a. garden in which all the
flowers of two hemispheres seem to have made their home. We have
been reminded over and over again, and on nearly every day of our
stay in Australia, of the welcome which the climate gives to the flowers
of other lands, and nowhere is the reminder more forcible than in the
gardens of these country-houses near Melbourne. Every description of
ornamental tree and flowering shrub is to be found there, and exotics
vie with the native flowers of Australia in covering the ground with all
the colors known to the artist. Not only is the ground carpeted with
them, but the trunks of the trees, the posts that support the houses,
and even the fronts and roofs of the buildings themselves, are so cov-
ered with creeping and flowering plants that scarcely any of the origi-
nal wood or other material is visible.

"Evidently Melbourne knew that we had been treated to a brick-
fielder in Sydney, and was therefore determined to give us a taste of its
climatic peculiarities before our departure. To oflset the hot wind of
Sydney we had a. ' southerly burster' in Melbourne, and also two or
three showers of rain that came down with such vigor as to fill the
gutters of the lower streets to a depth of two or three feet. Most
of the crossings are bridged, so that one can walk over the temporary
rivers in safety, but in former times accidents were not infrequent.
'Another Child Drowned in the Gutters Yesterday ' was by no means
an unusual heading in the Melbourne papers, and sometimes full-grown
men fell victims to the streams that flowed like mill-races while they
lasted. ,

"A gentleman says that quite recently he saw a man try to jump
across a. gutter, but he made a misoalculation and fell into it. Instantly
the stream took him off his feet and carried him partly under a low
bridge, where he would have been drowned had not the spectators
pulled him out by the heels. Melbourne streets are very muddy in
wet weather and very (lusty in dry times. The mud in winter is
said to be something almost surpassing belief, unless one has actually
seen and tested it. Most of the streets are macadamized with a. basaltic
rock which breaks up into a very irritating and disagreeable dust that
is said to be trying to the eyes of a. good many people.

"But about the burster, which I had forgotten for the moment.
The weather was fine and warm, with a north-east breeze and not a
cloud in the sky. In the morning Doctor Bronson remarked that the
barometer was falling, and during the forenoon it continued to go down
with considerable rapidity.

"We were going on an excursion, but the gentleman whohad in-
vited us came around to suggest a postponement, as we were about to
have a burster. 'We always expect it,' said be, 'when the barometer
falls rapidly in the foreuoon, as it is 'doing now.'

"So we stayed in and watched for the storm. There was an appear-
ance as if a thin sheet of cloud was being rolled up before the advan-
cing wind; in fact it was not unlike the beginning of the brickfielder in
Sydney. Then came a high wind which brought clouds of dust, and
then the breeze chopped suddenly to the south and blew with greatA "SOUTHERLY BURSTER." 481

violence. It was thirty miles an hour at the start, but before it got
through with its performance it was sixty or seventy miles. It has
been known to go to ninety or a hundred miles, and on one occasion it
reached one hundred and fifty miles an hour, and did a great deal of
damage.

"The thermometer fell more rapidly than the barometer had done.
In the morning about nine o'clock themercury was at 89deg Fahrenheit,
and it remained about that figure until the wind went around to the
south a little past noon. In less than an hour it had fallen twenty de-
grees, and in another hour twenty more. These sudden changes are
the trying features of the Australian climate, but the people say nobody
suffers from them except in discomfort.

" They tell us that the mercury has been known to drop thirty def
grew in half an hour, and the readings of the thermometer at noon and
midnight sometimes show a variation of ninety-nine degrees. William
Howitt mentions experiencing a. temperature of 139deg in the shade, and
it is no uncommon thing for the mercury to mount to 130deg. There is
an official record of 179deg in the sun and 111deg in the shade in South Mel-
bourne, and at the inland town of Deniliquin of 121" in the shade.

"The burster ended towards evening with a heavy fall of rain that

31
filled all the gutters to their fullest capacity, and but for the bridges at
the crossings would have made them navigable for small boats. Thunder
and lightning accompanied the rain, and while it lasted the shower was
as tropical as one could have wished.
Nowhere else in the world have we
seen header or more drenching
rain than in Australia.

" If you want to know how fast
rain can fall here, look at these
figures:

" On February 25, 1873, nearly

ammo 8113mm. nine inches of rain fell in as many

hours. At Newcastle, March 18,

1871, they had the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Australia; ten and

a half inches fell in two and a half hours, accompanied by a terrific

squall of thunder and lightning. During the whole storm, which lasted
twenty-two hours, more than twenty inches of rain fell."

Our friends went to Ballarat, one hundred miles from Melbourne,
and once an important gold-mining centre. It is still heavily interested '
in gold-mining, but the alluvial diggings in its neighborhood were ex-
hausted long ago, and the operations at present are confined to the reefs
or ledges of rock. The mines are in the suburbs, and as our friends
entered the city and passed along the wide avenue called Sturt Street,
with shade-trees along its centre, they could hardly believe they were
in a mining town. There is hardly a. trace of the usual features of a'
mining region ; the public buildings are substantial, there are numerous
churches, the streets are wide, well shaded with trees, and the town
boasts of a botanical garden on the shores of a lake where there'are
numerous pleasure-boats! Who would dream of finding these things in
a town devoted to taking gold from the earth? _

This was the scene of the great rush in 1851, after the discovery of
gold became known. Some of the earlier diggers obtained from twenty
to fifty pounds of gold daily; the precious metal lay almost on the sur-
face, and in several instances large nuggets were turned up by the
wheels of bullockcarts, or were found shining in the sun after a heavy
shower.

"They told us," said Frank in giving the account of his visit to the
gold-mines, " that a man one day sat down to rest at the foot of a tree
in the scrub. Wishing to sharpen his knife, he proceeded to rub it upon
a large stone that lay half imbedded between the roots. As he rubbed' A MINER'S GOOD--LUCK. 483

away on the supposed stone, what'was his surprise to see it turn to gold!
With his knife he dug around it, gashed it in several places, and found
he had unearthed a nugget larger than he could carry. Here was a.
fortune, and all gained by accident!

" What to do he did not know. He could not carry the nugget, and
he dared not go away to obtain aid, lest it might be discovered in his
absence, and also for fear he might not find his way back to it. If he
dug a. hole and concealed it, some one might observe him, and would
know at once what he was about; and he could not wait where he was,
as he might be there for days without being seen, and he had no pro-
visions with him. Besides, his first visitors might be bush-rangers, who
would appropriate his treasure to their own use, and quite likely knock
him in the head to get rid of a disagreeable witness against them.

" He did the best thing he could under the circumstances. He cov-
ered his treasure with earth and leaves, then tied his shirt to a neigh-
boring tree to mark the spot, and, half naked, went as quickly as possi-

accompany him to the place and secure the prize. Luckily no one had
been there in his absence, and the great nugget was borne safely to the
commissioner's tent.

"According to Australian history, gold was discovered at Lewis
Pond Creek, in New South Wales, in February, 1851, by Edward Har-
greaves; and at Clunes, sixteen miles from Ballm'at, Victoria>>, in July of
the same year, by a miner named Esmond. Both Hargreaves and Es-HOW GOLD WAS DISCOVERED IN VICTORIA. 485

mond were rewarded by the Government for their discoveries; they had
been gold~mineis in California, and were led to search where they did
through the similarity of the ground. There is a report that gold was
really found by a shepherd near Clunes at least two years before the
discovery by Esmond; and there is another report that gold was found
in 1814 by convicts who were building a road over the Blue Mountains,
but the Government kept the discovery secret.

" No gold-mining region in the world ever gave up so much of the
precious metal in the same time as did Ballurat in the early days.

The total yield of the Aus-
tralian gold-mines up to the present time is said to be very nearly one
billion seven hundred million dollars.

"Just before gold was discovered in Victoria the colony had seventy-
seven thousand inhabitants; in a single year eighty thousand were
added to the population, and three years after the gold discovery there
were two hundred and thirty-six thousand inhabitants there. The num-
ber has increased ever since with more or less steadiness, and now ex-
ceeds a. million. In 1854: there were fifty-one females to every one hun-
dred males; now the proportions are eighty-eight to one hundred."
"We went from Ballarat to Sandhurst, another mining city," said
Fred in his journal. "It was formerly known as Bencligo, and in old
times was the scene of a. rush much like that to Ballarat. It has had
about the same history as Ballarat, having been wonderfully rich in
alluvial diggiugs, then almost deserted, and finally doing a fine business

in quartz mining. In one respect, today, it differs from Ballarat; at
the latter place the mines are in the suburbs, while here they are right
in the city. There is a mine in nearly every backyard; gold is some-
times--so they say--picked up in the street, and is even in the bricks of
the houses. The first brick house built in Sandhurst was pulled down
and crushed, and the crushing yielded three ounces of gold to the ton;

at any rate, that's what they tell us, and they're very earnest about
it too.SALT AND FRESH LAKES TOGETHER. '487

     

" Then we came back by
railway through Ballamt as far
as Geelong, where we turned off
to Colac and Camperdown to
see the famous Lake district of
Victoria. At Colec we climbed
a. hill, and from its summit count-
ed fifteen lakes varying in size Lnxs scrxsnr.

from tiny ponds to that of the

Dead Sea, of Korengamite, with an area. of forty-nine thousand acres,
and a. circuit of more than ninety miles. It is so salt that no fish can
live in its \vatex's----salter a good deal than the sea.

"A strange feature of the lakes of this region is that they are alter-
nately salt and fresh. Almost at our feet, as we sat on the summit of
the hill, were five lakes, two fresh and three salt, and they were sepa-
rated by very narrow strips of land. The salt is said to come from the
drainage of the rocks, the water being evaporated faster than it flows
in. In summer the lakes fall below their winter level, and leave great
quantities of salt on the banks, where it is gathered by the people.

"We all agree that we have never seen prettier lake scenery any-
where in the world than in this famous western district of Victoria.
The lakes are at various levels, the larger ones studded with islands,
and the shores of the salt lakes glistening with snowy crystals. In the
landscape are plains, undulating areas, and mountains. The plains are
dotted with trees, there are flocks of sheep and herds of cattle scattered
over them, and here and there we can make out the houses of the pros-
perous farmers, and trace the fences that enclose fields of grain. Most
of the smaller lakes are in the craters of extinct volcanoes, and there is
abundant evidence that this region was once the scene of great convul-
sions of nature.

" Warnamhool and Belfast are the ports of this district, and they
supply the markets of Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, as well as the
nearer one of Melbourne, with potatoes. The people claim that their
potatoes are without competitors. quality and quantity being of the
highest class. The maximum yields are from twenty to thirty tons an
acre; land sells for four hundred dollars an acre for growing potatoes,
and one happy land-owner lets out two square miles of ground for twen-
ty-five dollars an acre annually! This is the part of the country that
was originally named Australia. Felix, and it certainly deserved the title."

"Where will we go next 1" queried one of the youths, as the party
was returning from Colac to Melbourne.

"Where do you wish to go 2" said the Doctor, answering one ques-
tion by asking another.

" According to what they tell us," responded the original questioner,
" there is still a great deal to be seen--at least from a resident's point
of view.

"We are urged to visit cattle and sheep stations in the interior, but
there can hardly be anything especially new about them after what
we have seen in New South Wales and Queensland; so I vote against
any more pastoral visits."

The other members of the party assented to his opinion, and it was
decided that time did not permit them to stay longer among sheep and
cattle.

For a similar reason it was concluded to decline an invitation to
spend a few days in Gippsland, which was named after one of the for-
mer governors and is famous for its mountain scenery, its lakes, rivers,
and other natural features. Some portions of it are too rough for agri-
culture, hut a considerable part is peculiarly rich and fertile, and pro
duces abundantly when brought under cultivation. A large proportion
of the cattle sold in the Melbourne market comes from Gippsland; and
the region has great resources in minerals, which are as yet but slightly
developed.FROM MELBOURNE TO "sums. 489

Tourists with a love for fishing and shooting generally find time to
visit Gippsland, as these sports can be had there to the fullest extent.
The forests of this region are very dense, and consequently the clearing
of the land is attended with considerable expense. Frank thought, with
a. sigh, of the trout in the streams of this fertile district; he had hoped
to be the captor of some of them, but his hopes were dashed when it
was decided to give the go-by to
Gippsland.

"And now," said the Doctor,

" I'll tell you my plan." The
youths listened attentively as he
continued: '

" Today is Tuesday. There's
a steamer twice a. week (Monday
and Thursday) for Launceston, in
Tasmania. We are due at Mel-
bourne at 3.41 this afternoon; we '
will devote this evening and to-
morrow to saying good-by to our
friends, and leave by the steam-
er on Thursday for Launceston.
How will that do 2"

The youths promptly assent--
ed, as they always did when the
Doctor told them his plans, and
it was at once agreed that the
scheme would be carried out. Ar- , mm," "mm
rangements were made accord-
ingly, the farewell calls were made in the time prescribed by social
rules, and the steamer started at noon on the appointed day. She car-
ried the party across Bass's Strait during the night, and on the next
morning they were at the entrance of the Tamar River, on their way
to Lauuceston, forty miles up the stream, and two hundred and sixty-
seven from Melbourne.

Frank wondered ,why the name of the island was changed from Van
Dieman's Land to Tasmania. He received the following explanation:

"It was discovered by the Dutch navigator Abel J ans Tasman, in
1642, and by him was named Van Dieman's Land, in honor of the then
governor of the Dutch East Indies. Tasman was in love with the
Governor's daughter, Maria, and gave her name to one of the smaller
islands. Van Dieman's Land was first permanently occupied in 1803,
when the British Government established a convict-station there, and
soon followed it by other convict-stations. It was a penal colony from
its settlement until 1853, when transportation was discontinued; during
this half century many thousands of convicts were sent there, and the
name of Van Dieman's Land was insepanably connected with the hor-
rors of the system of English deportation and the crimes which led
to it.

" Consequently many of the colonists sought a change of name for
their country; and on the first of January, 1856, it was made, in reply
to an address of the Legislative Council, in which it was represented
that the 'letters patent of the bishop were for the diocese of Tasmania,
that the colonists used the title generally, and it was preferred to Van
Dieman's Land by the colonists and by this council.' It is to be hoped
that the history of transportation will eventually be as much a thing of
the past as is the former name of this beautiful island."

Our friends found the scenery of the Tamar interesting; and as the
steamer slowly stemmed the current, they were treated to a constantly
changing and never wearying panorama. The island is the smallest of
the Australian colonies; it is about the size of Scotland, and resembles
it in being full of fine scenery. It is a land of mountains, lakes, and
rivers; its climate is a little warmer than that of England, and a little
more dry, and everything that grows in the British Islands will grow
in Tasmania. The banks of the Tamar reminded our friends of those
of the Thames, save that they were not as well peopled, and the mount-
ain ranges which formed the background on either side were lofty and
picturesque.

As the vessel neared her destination, Frank and Fred were informed
that they were at the head of the Tamar, or would be when they
reached Launceston. "The North Esk and the South Esk," said their
informant, "come together at Launceston, and their union forms the
Tamar. The North Esk comes tumbling down from a rocky region,
while the South Esk flows through a rich agricultural district closely
resembling some of the best farming country of England."

And so they found it when on the following day they made an ex-
cursion into the region under consideration. The resemblance to Eng-
land was heightened by the hedges that separated the fields from one
another, and were a most agreeable change from the rail and wire
fences to which they had become accustomed during their travels in
Australia. The soil appeared to be of unusual fertility, and they read-LAUNCESTON AND ITS ATTRACTIONS. 4:91

ily accepted the statement of one of the residents that Tasmania was
the garden of the world. "Everything that grows in England grows
here," said he, "and grows better. The fruits are larger and of finer
flavor; the yield of grain is more to the acre; and as to quality, there
is nothing that can surpass that of our products. Our great drawbacks
are distance from markets, the high price of labor, and the lack of suit-
able means for bringing the products of the farms to the seaports. We
could supply the whole of Victoria with jam made from our fruits; but
as she grows fruit herself, she has a protective tarifi' that practically
excludes us."

They found Iannceston a, pretty little city of about seventeen thou-
sand inhabitants, and picturesquely situated. It has the usual public
buildings and parks, and in its vicinity are several show-places, which

they visited in the afternoon. In a carriage they went to Corra Linn,
six miles from Launceston, where the North Esk pours through a gate-
way of basaltic rock, and dashes over a bed of bowlders that break the
water into a mass of foam; then it changes suddenly into a quiet stream
which reflects the rocks and foliage bending over it; then changes again
into tumbling rapids, and afterwards becomes the calm stream that
unites with the South Esk to form the Tamar.
"After Corra Linn," said Frank, "we saw the Cataract Gorge and
the Punch Bowl, which are favorite places of: resort of the citizens,
and are certainly very pretty and interesting. Then we walked in the
Town Park, and saw the Garden Crescent, which is a popular recreation
ground and much frequented. In the evening we had an interesting
conversation with a gentleman whom we met at the hotel, or rather on

the steamer which brought us from Melbourne. We asked to be per-
mitted to take notes of what he said; he readily consented, and here it
is as Fr ed and I jotted it down:

" 'We have about one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants in
the island, which' is divided into eighteen counties, and these are again
subdivided into parishes, for administrative purposes. We have self-
government on the same general plan as the other Australian colonies,
and have been self-governing since 1856. Our climate is remarkable
for its mildness, being removed from the extremes of heat and cold;
the summers are never unpleasantly hot, and woollen clothing may be
worn throughout the year; while the winters are not severe enough,
even in the table-lands of the interior, to stop work in the fields. Snow
covers the tops of the mountains in winter, but rarely falls on the low-
lands; and when it does come it doesn't stay long.

" 'We love England, and have named most of our counties after those
of the old countr ; and in religion we are English. Out of our whole
population more than half are adherents of the English Church; then
come the Catholics with 30,000, Methodists 10,000, Church of ScotlandRELIGIONS 1N TASMANIA. 493

9000, and Independents 5000. Other religions are not numerous in
their following, but we have a good deal of variety, as we have Moham-
medans and Pagans in addition to Israelites and several smaller sects
of Christians. We are a law-abiding people generally; and when you
remember that the country was for so long the receptacle of convicts,
you will admit that our proportion of crime is very small.

"'The people of Australia sometimes call us Van Demonians in
derision; but we don't mind it, though we would like to have the name
of Van Dieman's Land forgotten, as it has so many unpleasant associa-
tions. But however glad we are that we ceased to be a convict colony,
there is no getting over the fact that the most prosperous days of the
island were when transporta-
tion was in existence.'

" Doctor Bronson asked
him to explain this, which he
did.

"'The prosperity,' be con-
tinued, ' was due to several
causes. In the first place, the
Government sent its convicts
here, and it maintained a large
military and police force to
take care of them. This meant
an expenditure of money; the
annual outlay of the Gov-
ernment in Tasmania 'was
PS350,000, and of course we
lost this when transportation
stopped. Then, too, the free
colonists that came out here
received grants of land, and
also assignments of convicts
to work the land, the size of
the grants being proportioned
to the number of convicts that
a colonist would receive.

_ " ' It was a good thing for

In- nAr IN mt nusn. the squatter, and he was not

slow to take advantage of it.

It was like negro slavery, with the addition that the slaves cost nothing

to the owner. If a man died, the squatter could get another for noth-

ing; if a man ran away, he was generall)r recaptured at once if he

did not starve in the bush; and if he misbehaved himself in any way,
the squatter sent him to the nearest magistrate to be flogged.'

" ' Were the squatters not allowed to administer punishment ?' que-
ried Doctor Bronson.

"'No, the)' were not,' was the reply; 'but the magistrate usually
applied the lash without taking the trouble to inquire into the case. Itconvw'r LIFE IN VAN mum's LAND. 495

was no uncommon thing for a convict employed on a squatter's station
to be sent with a. note to the magistrate, in which the latter was re-
quested to give the man two or three dozen lashes, as the case might
be. He received them and was sent home; if he ran away, either before
or after the flogging, notice was given at once, and the police were
speedily after him. In the hush he could easily elude the police, but'
the necessity for food generally drove him to surrender or led to his
capture. No one was allowed to give food to a runaway; and as the
general safety depended on the suppression of bush-ranging, no one was
inclined to do so.'

"'But didn't men sometimes make their escape and live in the
bush?'

 

A CAN? "7 THE BUS".

"' Only in a few instances. One runaway managed to hide himself
for seven years, building a hut and raising a few vegetables in a spot
where he was not discovered. He kept a goat and a. few sheep, and
came occasionally in the night to the nearest station to steal a few arti-
cles that he needed. But at length the solitude was too much for him,
and he came to the very station that he had plundered, and gave him-
self up. The squatter's wife was alone with her children when the man
appeared, with his hair long and tangled, a few sheepskins stitched to-
gether for his clothing, and his whole appearance denoting destitution
and despair.'

" 'What was done with him 2'

" ' The squatter was a gentleman of influence; he realized that the
convict could easily have murdered his. wife and children, and in grati-
tude for his forbearance he became interested in the man's case, and ob
tained his pardon. The man afterwards became a prosperous farmer,
and led a strictly honest life.

" 'Not only were the convicts valuable as servants or laborers for
the squatters and employers generally,' continued the gentleman, ' but
they were also useful for the public works that are needed in a new
country. There is a fine wagon-road from Launceston to Hobart, one
hundred and twenty miles, which was built by gangs of convicts work-
ing under overseers and guards. There isn't a better read in Europe
than this; and the same may be said of other roads that were built by
convict labor in the early days of the colony. Before the railway was
built, the stagecoaches used to run through from one place to the other
in thirteen hours, or at the rate of nine miles an hour.

" 'When you reach Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, you will find a
handsome town of twenty thousand inhabitants, with good streets and
substantial buildings, the Government House being one of the best be-
longing to a British colony anywhere. Hobart was largely built by
convict labor; and so, you see, we have many things to remind us that
transportation was not by any means a detriment to the country.' "FROM LAUNCESTON TO DELORAINE. 497

"r HE forenoon of our second day in Tasmania," said Frank, "was

iug, reached Deloraine, forty-five miles, at a quarter past ten, had an
hour and three-quarters in and around the place, and started at noon on
our return. They urged us to stay longer, and see more; and some of
the acquaintances we had made seemed much disappointed that we de--
clined to do so. The Tasmanians are as hospitable as their Australian
neighbors, and do their utmost to make the stranger feel at home.

 

NEAR DELOMINE.

"They specially wished us to visit the Chudleigh Caves, which are
about twenty miles from Deloraine, and are considered, by the Tasmar
nians at least, among the wonders of the world. We were told that we
could walk five miles underground, and see the entire caves in about
four hours; that the mud and water would nowhere be more than three
feet deep, and there were many places in the caves where there was no
mud at all. No doubt the caves are remarkable; but as we had seen
the Mammoth and Luray Caves, we did not specially care for those of
Ohudleigh, much to the disappointment of the gentleman who urged us
to see them.

"The railway between Launceston and Deloraine passes through a
fertile country in which there are many fine farms, and a goodly num-
ber of pastoral stations devoted to the rearing of high-class sheep which
are exported to Australia to improve the flocks of that country. The
train rolled through glades and over plains, along the sides of mountains
and across rippling streams, and as we approached Delora-ine the con-
ductor called our attention to a bold spur of a mountain called Quain-
by Bluff, which is the end of a long range that filled the horizon.

"On our return to Launceston we were just in time to catch theDEATH OF THE LAST TASMANIAN. ' 499

3 an. train for Hobart, which we reached at eight o'clock in the even-
ing. The Launceston and Western Railway is of broad gauge, but the
line'to Hobart is a. narrow one (three feet six inches), on account of the
heavy work in the mountains through which its route is laid. As long
as the daylight lasted we had a beautiful panorama, the scene changing
at every turn of the sinuous track. Occasionally we had glimpses of
the old carriagewad built by the convicts, and were impressed with its
solidity and the thoroughness of the work of which it is evidence. It is
said that the road cost more than a. railway would at present; and I
have no doubt, after seeing it, that this was the case.

"We asked if any aberiginals could be seen along the route, and
were told that the last Tasmanian aboriginal, Truganini, or Lalla
Rookh, died in 1876, and the last Tasmanian man in 1869. When the
island was first occupied by the English, there were four or five thou-
sand natives upon it; there was incessant war between them and the
whites until 1832, when the greater number of the blacks had been
killed, only a few hundreds remaining. In 1854 there were only sixteen
of them alive, and these gradually died off.

" It is said that when the English landed in Tasmania they mistook
the friendly signs of the natives for hostile ones, and the mistake led
the commanding officer to order his men to fire on the group that had
assembled on the beach. Fifty natives were killed on this occasion, and
thus a needless war was begun.

" Of course we have been invited to visit gold-mines and other
places where valuable minerals are found; they tell us that Tasmania
contains the most valuable tin-mine in the world, its annual yield being
worth nearly a million dollars. It was discovered in 1872 by a man
who was regarded by his neighbors as more than half a lunatic. For
years he sought for tin among the mountains, suffering all sorts of
hardships and privations; and when at last he found the desired deposit,
his assertion that he had done so was not believed. He was nicknamed
'Philosopher Smith,' and had great difficulty in securing attention to
his discovery and raising the necessary capital for working the mine.
Like most discoverers,he did not reap the reward for what he found, as
he was compelled to sell his shares in the mine while they were at a
very low price. A share originally costing thirty shillings was worth
PS80 a few years later.

" A few miles before reaching Hobart we came to the banks of the
Derwent, the river on which the capital stands. It is a beautiful stream
flowing down from the interior mountains, and its valley is said to be
exceedingly picturesque. Hobart justified the description which our
friend at Launceston gave us ; it stands on seven hills, with a larger hill,
called Knocklofty, behind it; and behind this bill again is Mount Wel-
lington, 4166 feet high. The harbor is deep and capacious, and the nav-
igation is so easy that ships often come in without pilots.

"Until 1881 this place was called Hobart Town, or Hobarton ; in
that year the name was officially changed to Hobart.

"The day after our arrival we climbed to thetop of Mount Wel-
lington, and were well repaid for the fatigue of the ascent by the mag-
nificent view it afi'orded. It was landscape and seascape together, and
both extensive and picturesque. Water and land were spread below us
as on a map, and we looked away towards the Southern Pole, and won-
dered what would be encountered if we journeyed in that direction.

 

 

AUSTRALIA AT T")! "EMT 01' TASMANIA.

" Hobart is a famous resort of Australians, who come here to escape
the heat of summer. Its climate is delightful, and if all that the inhab-
itants claim is true, the Australians who come here have no reason to
complain. Doctor Bronson says he has been told that the ladies of Tas-
mania are so charming that the friends of an Australian bachelor trem-
ble for him whenever he decides to spend the summer at Hobart. But
the Doctor says the friends of a. Tasmanian bachelor might be equallyPARKS AND GARDENS or HOBART. 501

fearful when the latter goes to Melbourne or Sydney for an extended
visit.

" New York boasts of its Franklin Square, where the Harpers have
their great publishing house. Hobart has its Franklin Square, which is
a. pretty garden in memory of Sir John Franklin, who was governor
here at one time; in the centre of the garden is a. bronze statue of the

renowned navigator. There are other gardens and parks; there are
the Royal Society's grounds and the Queen's Domain, which are much
frequented; and there is a splendid cricket-ground, where games are
played very often. We have witnessed a rowing match between the
Hobart and the Mercantile rowing clubs, and are told that there is
a grand regatta here every year that brings many visitors from Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and other cities. Altogether, Hobart im.
presses us most agreeably, and the inhabitants are justly proud of it."
The stay of the party in Tasmania was somewhat shortened by rea
son of their haste to reach South Australia. They made a brief visit
to Port Arthur, which is about three hours distant from Hobart by
steamer, and lies in a landlocked bay enclosed between rugged hills,
which completely shelter it from the wind. Here are the prisons where
thousands of convicts were once confined under the most rigorous disci-
pline, the least infraction of the rules being punished with the lash, and
serious ones by death through
hanging.

The story is that the lat-
ter punishment was so fre--
quent that the jail chaplain
at Hobart once made a pro-
test, not against hanging in
general or the number of
men hanged, but at the press-
ure upon their facilities He
said that no more than thir-
teen men could be comforta-
bly executed at once, and the
crowding had been too great;
he trusted that for the future

on or ms WATCH-nous. the accommodations of the
jail might not be overtaxed.

Our friends saw the prisons at Port Arthur, but the prisoners have
been gone since 1876. The massive buildings remain without tenants,
and are going to decay as fast as solid stone structures can go. Frank
and Fred were specially interested '
in "The Neck," the narrow isth-
mus which connects the main-land
with the peninsula, where the pris-
ons stand. Across The Neck sav-
age dogs were formerly chained
at such close intervals that 9, 1110.11
could not pass between them; the
isthmus is not more than a hun-
dred feet in width, and as there
were fifteen dogs kept there, a. man
had no chance of passing them. If
he attempted to swim around them
at night, the dogs were expected to
give warning by barking; and the "Lnxu. no r'
waters are so infested with sharks
that a person swimming has little chance of getting away with his life.

The dogs were also used for hunting down the few prisoners whoPRISONERS ESCAPING INTO THE BUSH. 503

managed to get past the line. The number of escapes was very small;
but in spite of all precautions, escapes did occur. The most notable in:
stance is that of three men, Martin Cash, Jones, and Cavanagh, who
swam across the bay one night, reached a farm-house in the early morn--
ing, and there provided themselves with weapons and ammunition be-
fore their escape was discovered. Thus equipped for highway rob-

bery and defence, they remained free for years, but were taken and

hanged at last. Convicts at Port Arthur and other Tasmanian pris-
ons were known as "yellow-birds," on account of the yellow uniform
they wore.

" Rather suddenly," said Fred," we left Hobart one day for South
Australia, as we found that if we waited for the next steamer we should
be detained longer than we cared to be in Tasmania. Three days ear-
ried us to our destination at Port Adelaide, where we again set foot on
the Australian continent.

" We passed up the Gulf of St. Vincent, and entered Port Adelaide
between two large shoals of sand which are marked by light-houses.
The captain of the steamer told us that the port was formerly difficult
of entrance and quite shallow, but it has been deepened within the past
few years, and the channels have been widened, so that it is now acces-
sible for very large ships. As its name implies, it is the port of Ade-
laide, the capital of South Australia, seven miles away, and easily acces-
sible by a doubletrack railway.

"We landed at a long and handsome pier, and had time to observe,
before leaving for the city, that a great deal of money has been expend-
ed in dock and pier facilities, and in making the harbor a suitable one
for an ambitious colony. There are immense sheds for the storage of
wool and grain, there are graving docks and repair shops, manufactories
of several kinds, two or three hospitals, a. home for sailors, churches,
schools, public buildings of the usual kinds found at a well--arranged sear
port, and hotels and restaurants sufficient for the entertainment of all
who are likely to remain long enough to require them.

"The railway carried us to Adelaide in about twenty minutes, and
we found ourselves in a city whose regularity reminded us of Philadel-
phia or Chicago. It was founded in 1837 by Colonel Light, who named
it after the queen of William IV. ; it originally contained one thousand
and forty-two allotments of one acre each, and is built nearly in the
form of a square, with the streets at right angles. The ground is almost
a level plain, and the situation is about five miles from the Mount Lofty
range of hills, whose highest point is two thousand three hundred feet
above the sea-level.

"The streets of Adelaide are wide and generally handsome; the
show one of all is King William Street, which runs from south to north
and bisects the city. We drove along this street, and were all agreed
that we would have to travel very far to find a. handsomer avenue in a
city no older than this. We passed the Government'Ofiices, which is an
extensive pile of buildings forming a solid block, and covering a large
area. Close by the Government Buildings is the Town--hall, which is
conspicuous for its high tower, and on the other side of the street is the
l'ostofiice, which accommodates both the postoflice and the telegraph,
and will do so until Adelaide is more than twice its present size. The
white freestone of which the Town-hall and Post-office are built is said
to have come from some extensive quarries near the city.IN THE CAPITAL OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

"In addition to the public edifices, King William Street contains
banks, newspaper offices, and other private buildings that would be a
credit to any city of Em'ope or America. As for churches, I don't
know how many we have seen in our drive through the principal streets;
they give the impression that Adelaide is a very religious city, and that
her wealthy people have been very liberal in providing places of wor-
ship. All the prominent religions are represented, the Church of Eng-
land taking the lead, as in the other colonies.

" At the last census of South Australia the Church of England had
7 6,000 adherents, Roman Catholics numbered 43,000, Methodists 42,000,
Lutherans 20,000, Presbyterians 18,000, Baptists 14,000, and Congre-
gationalists, Bible Christians, and Primitive Methodists about 10,000
each. N 0 State aid is given to any of the churches, all of them being
supported by voluntary contributions. There are nearly a thousand
churches and chapels in the colony, exclusive of four hundred other
buildings which are occasionally used for religious worship.

"We asked the driver of our carriage to show us some of the finest
private residences; he did so, and we certainly commend the good taste
of the leading citizens in their architecture. Our drive extended to
North Adelaide, which is to 'the city' what South Melbourne is to
Melbourne, being principally a place for residence. The river Torrens
separates Adelaide from its northern suburb; we crossed it on one of
three handsome bridges, and found it less worthy of the name of river
than is the Yarra at Melbourne, its bed being little more than a dry
waste of sand. Ten months in the year this is said to be its condition;
for the other two months it is an impetuous flood.

"The river isn't as bad as it was, as a dam has been thrown across
it near the jail, and the water held by it forms a narrow lake about two
miles long, which furnishes a floating-place for steam-launches and row-
boats in great number. We took a sail on one of the launches, and
enjoyed it very much; the lake reminded us in some respects of the
Ausser Alster at Hamburg, and seems to be much appreciated by the
citizens. The water supply of the city comes from the Torrens; it is
drawn into reservoirs a few miles above the city, and brought thence
through covered mains into the city limits.

"The population of the city itself is about 50,000, and there are said
to be 130,000 people living within a radius of ten miles from the Town-
hall. The population of the Whole territory of South Australia is not
far from 350,000, including about 5000 aboriginals. The area of the
colony, including the Northern Territory, is estimated at 903,690 squareEARLY SCENE IN THE COLONY.
miles; it covers twenty-seven degrees of--latitude and twelve of longi-
tude, and is more than fifteen times as large as England and Wales
combined. Its greatest length is 1850 miles, and its greatest width 650
miles.

"We delivered some letters of introduction, and were hospitably
received, our entertainers doing their best to give us a good opinion
of the city and colony. One of them told us that Adelaide had been
called the ' City of Churches; on account of the number and beauty of
its religious edifices; and also the ' Farinaceous Oity,' owing to its great
shipments of wheat and flour. South Australia is largely devoted to
wheat culture, and some of the farms will rival the great wheat-fanns
of the North-western States of America. They have all the improved
machinery for raising wheat on a grand scale, and their owners are lib-
eral buyers of American ploughs, mowers, reapers, and other appara-
tus intended for economy of labor in producing the ' staff of life.'

"We visited one of these large wheat-farms, and were greatly im-
pressed with what we saw there.- It employs ordinarily about seventy
hands, and in the busy season the number often exceeds two hundred.
Everything is reduced to a system, and the manager is autocratic in his
power; there is a set of printed rules to govern the conduct of the men,
and they are required to sign them when engaged. All hands are
called when a. bell rings at 5 an; horses are cleaned and fed before
6 A.M., when breakfast is served; the teams are in the field by seven
o'clock; an hour is allowed at noon for dinner, and then work con-
tinues till 6 Par. in summer and 5 an. in winter. Supper is served at
seven; horses are fed and watered at half-past eight, and the dining-
room is cleared and locked up at ten o'clock.

"First-class hands receive twenty shillings (five dollars) weekly,
second--class eighteen shillings, and third-class sixteen shillings. Any
one in charge of horses who abuses them, or neglects to feed and care
for them properly, is discharged at once, and forfeits all wages due
him. Varying penalties are affixed 'for other offences, and the induce-
ment is held out that any laborer can raise himself to a firstclass posi-
tion by good and industrious conduct.

"The product of wheat in the colony varies in different seasons; in
1884--85 it was nearly fifteen million bushels, but since then it has been
much less, owing to severe droughts. There are nearly seven millions
of sheep in South Australia, and the wool crop is the next in impor
tance to the bread-stuffs. The colony produces great quantities of
grapes, and the export of wine is steadily increasing. Grapes, peaches,PRODUCTS 01" SOUTH. AUSTRALIA. 509

apricots, oranges, and kindred fruits grow with very little attention,
and in their season they are retailed in the market of Adelaide at a
penny a pound; so that all tables are liberally supplied with them. We
have eaten some very fine fruit since we came here, but the people tell
us we are not in the time of year to see the orchards at their best.
"There are several pretty watering-places within a few miles of
Adelaide, where the people go in summer to enjoy the cool breezes from
the southern seas. One of the favorite spots of this sort is Glenelg,
which is only a few miles distant, and easily reached by railway. We
went there one afternoon, partly to see what it was like and partly be-
cause it is where the colony was founded. 0n the 28th of December,
1836, Captain Hindmarsh landed there, and in the presence of a. few
officials and some two hundred immigrants, who had been sent out from '
London, read his commission as the first governor of South Australia,
and proclaimed the foundation of the colony.

" The ceremony took place under a venerable gum-tree, or Eucalyp--
tus, which is known as " Proclamation Tree." We saw the tree, but it
has fallen and is greatly decayed, and Were it not for the board affixed
to it, telling that on this spot the colony was founded, no one would
consider it of any importance. The anniversary of this event is cele--
brated as a public holiday. All business is suspended on that day, and
Glenelg is crowded with people who come to look at the Proclamation
Tree, and enjoy the cool breeze that blows from the ocean.

 

I'ROCLAMATION TREE AT GLZSBLG, NEAR ADELAIDE.

"The long pier jutting into the bay at Glenelg is a favorite resort on
pleasant evenings, and our experience there reminded us of an evening
at Coney Island or Long Branch. The Orient and P. &. O. steamers
stop at Glenelg to land and receive the South Australian mails. The
anchorage is somewhat exposed to heavy winds, and occasionally there
is considerable delay in landing or embarking.

"The Adelaideans are very proud of their parks and gardens, and
with good reason. They certainly compare well with those of Sydneydais--Jab: z:a--.:.--m=< Z<

and Melbourne, and that is saying that they are very fine indeed. All
around the city there are reserved lands which vary in width but will
average not far from half a mile. They are intended for parks for the
public, and are planted with shade-trees and laid out into walks and
drives. As the city grows they will be in the midst of houses, and not
at such distances that a special journey will be required to reach them.

" Then they have squares of several acres in each quarter of the
city, beautifully laid out and planted with shade-trees, and they have
the Botanic Garden, of about forty acres, containing among other things
several fern-houses, shade-houses, a Victoria Regia house, and a large
and handsome palm-house, in which tropical plants are sheltered. We

' went repeatedly through the Botanic Garden, and constantly found
something to interest us. A few years ago a Museum of Economic
Botany was erected, and since it was opened to the public it has done
much practical good. Plants are distributed to those who desire them,
and many valuable or beautiful exotics have thus been acclimatized in
Australia."

As usual, Frank and Fred studied the map of the country, and con-
sidered its capabilities in the way of travel. Frank thought it would
be the best kind of fun to cross the continent from south to north, fol-
lowing the line of the overland telegraph from Adelaide to Port'Dar-
win. Fred was of the same opinion, but suggested that before breaching
the subject to the Doctor they should learn something about the route.

With this object in view they made inquiries, the replies to which
quite discouraged their enterprise. What they learned can best be given
in the words of their informant, a gentleman connected with the tele-
graph service.

" I have been over the whole line from Adelaide to Port Darwin,"
said he, "and will briefly tell you about it. The distance is about seven-
teen hundred miles, and more than half of it is uninhabited by white
men, except at the telegraph stations. Some of it can never be occu-
pied, as it is absolutely waterless; but in course of time, and with im-
proved means of obtaining or storing water, the greater part can be
made inhabitable.

"The first white man to cross the continent was John MoDouall
Stuart. Don't confound his name with that of Captain Start, a thing
that's very likely to happen, as they were intimately associated."

"Won't you kindly tell us a little about Captain Sturt?" asked one
of the youths. "We've heard his name frequently as that of one of
Australia's heroes."CAPTAIN STURT'S EXPLORATIONS. 513

"Certainly," was the reply. "Captain Charles Sturt was sent out
by the Sydney Government to make an exploration beyond the Blue
Mountains in the direction of the interior of the continent. Between
1827 and 1830 he made two expeditions, in which he discovered the
Darling and Murray rivers; on the second expedition he descended
those streams in a. whale-boat which he had taken along for the purpose
of navigating any rivers or lakes into which the smaller streams already

discovered took their course. The Macquarie, the Lachlan, and the
Murrumbidgee flow westward from the Dividing Range, but their out-
lets were then unknown.

" On his voyage down the Murray to the sea Sturt had several fights .
with the natives, underwent many hardships and accidents, and found
his men greatly reduced in strength. There he was obliged to turn
back and propel his boat against the stream/to the point whence it
started.

"It was a toilsome journey. The natives opposed the explorers, and
they fought their way from place to place, and it was only by the supe
riority of their fire-arms over the primitive weapons of the blacks that
they escaped with their lives. For fifteen hundred miles they travelled
in this way, and when they reached their old camp, on the twenty
seventh day of their'upward voyage, Start was hardly able to stand.

33
Provisions were exhausted, and when aid reached them they were at
the point of starvation. '

" In 1843, this same Captain Sturt offered to lead an expedition from
South Australia to the interior of the continent; his offer was accepted,
and in 1844 the expedition started on its way. Unfortunately summer
was approaching, and the party was destined to suffer terribly from
heat and thirst. For six months it was encamped in one spot, unable to
move; there was little or no water in the country, and four months
passed without a drop of rain or even of dew. Sturt reported that the
heat drew every screw and nail in their boxes; the horn handles of their
instruments, as well as their combs, were split into fine laminae; the lead
dropped out of their pencils; their signal--rockets were entirely spoiled;
their hair, as well as the wool of their sheep, ceased to grow ; and their
nails became as brittle as glass. Their flour lost more than eight per
cent. of its original weight, and other provisions in greater proportion.
The mean of the thermometer during December, January, and February
was 101deg, 104deg, and 101deg respectively in the shade, and in the sun it
sometimes reached 160deg.

"Sturt did everything that lay within human power to reach the
centre of the continent, but was unable to get nearer than within one
hundred and fifty miles of it. Some of his men died, and he turned
back when at a point where it was absolutely certain that no water lay
beyond.

"His draughtsman on that expedition was John McDonall Stuart,
the man who was the first to cross the continent from south to north,
and whom I asked you not to confound with Captain Sturt. ' Stuart
tried three times before he succeeded; at last, on July 10, 1862, he
reached the sea, at the mouth of the Adelaide River, in Van Dieman's
Gulf, on the north coast. '

"Very soon after the result of Stuart's expedition became known, it
was proposed to build a telegraph line across the continent, following
Stuart's track, to meet the cable from Singapore to Port Darwin, and
thus connect the colonies with the rest of the telegraphic world. The
work was planned and completed by Mr. Charles Todd, superintendent
of telegraphs, and was begun in 1870. On August 22, 1872, the first
message was sent over the completed line, and congratulations were
exchanged between London and Adelaide."

" Didn't the blacks give you a. great deal of trouble i" Frank asked.

" Less than was feared," was the reply. " We managed to give them
a wholesome dread of the 'white fellow's devil,' as they called it, andTHE AUSTRALIAN OVERLAND TELEGRAPH. 515

 

CAMP SCENE ON THE DESERT PLAINS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

though they have raided the stations on several occasions and killed the
officers, they have never disturbed the wires. While we were building
the hue we gave every native who visited us an electric shock, and it
seriously affected their nerves, and also their imaginations. Once we
had two of the most important chiefs at points more than a hundred
miles apart; we carried on conversations for them for two or three
hours, and then had them meet half way between the stations and com-
pare notes. To say they were awe-struck would be expressing it mild-
ly; they were fairly paralyzed with astonishment."

" How far apart are the stations?"

" The distances vary according to water and other conditions. Some
of the stations are more than a hundred miles from their neighbors on
either side, and at every station there are two operators and four line-
repairers. When a break occurs a repair party starts from the station
on each side, and travels along the line, testing it every twenty or thirty
miles until the fault has been found and communication restored. Then
the parties return to their own stations, generally without seeing each
other."

"How do you carry supplies through this desert ?" inquired Fred.

"We use camels, which were first introduced from Afghanistan by
Sir Thomas Elder, and have been found admirably adapted to the arid
regions of Australia. A camel-breeding establishment has been in exist--
ence at Beltane. for nearly twenty years, and more than a thousand
camels have been supplied from it for hauling stores and doing other
work that is usually performed by. oxen or horses. They are broken to
harness or the saddle; they draw drays or light pleasure-wagons, sin-
gly, and teams of six or eight camels are harnessed to heavy wagons,
which they easily pull through the sand together with a load of two or
three tons. The belle of Beltana, the daughter of the superintendent
of the station, has a camel which she rides with a sidesaddle just as a
belle of New York rides her favorite saddle-horse. All the later explor-
ing expeditions have been equipped with camels, and it was for explo-
ration that these animals were first brought here.

"About three years after the line was opened, the men at the Bar-
row Creek station, a. thousand miles from Adelaide, were attacked by
the blacks: A line-repairer and an operator, Mr. Stapleton, were mor-
tally wounded, and two others seriously. As Mr. Stapleton lay dying,
the news was flashed to Adelaide by the other operator. The doctor
and Mrs. Stapleton were summoned to a room in the Adelaide office,
where they listened to the click of the instrument, which told how the
husband's life was ebbing away in the far distant desert.

" An instrument was brought to his bedside and placed under his
hand. He received the doctor's message that his wound was fatal, re-
ceived the farewell of his wife, then telegraphed her an eternal good-by, .
and as he finished it his fingers clutched the key, and in a moment he
lay dead. I was one of the group that stood in the Adelaide office that
day, and you can easily believe that the scene moved everybody to tears."

The youths easily did believe it, for their own eyes were moist as
they heard the sad story. The gentleman paused for one, two, in fact
for several minutes, with his head turned away, and then resumed:

" The success of the telegraph has emboldened us, and we are new
building a railway along the same line, and hope to have it done within
the next ten years. Four hundred miles are completed northward from
Adelaide, and on the other side of the continent half that distance is in
the hands of contractors. Camels are employed to carry supplies, mate-
rial, and water to the men in advance of the end of the track, and the
work is being pushed forward very much as your builders in America
constructed the Central and Union Pacific railways across the great
plains east of the Rocky Mountains, and between those mountains and
the Sierra Nevada range."

THE mention of the explorations that preceded the construction of
the Australian overland telegraph drew the attention of our young
friends to the men whose names are famous in the history of Austra-
lian discovery. They had already thought of the subject when they
saw in Melbourne the bronze statue in memory of the explorers, Burke
and Wills, but at that time they were too busy to make any extended
investigation concerning it.

The result of their reading and other study of Australian explorar
tions they b1iefly summed up as follows:

" For the first twenty- -five years after the settlement at Sydney, in
1788, exploration was confined to the strip of land between the Blue
Mountains and the sea; it was not until 1813 that the mountains were
passed and the valley of the Fish River and the Bathurst plains visited.
The Lachlan River was discovered in 1815, and the Macquarie shortly
afterwards; both these rivers were traced to a marsh, and were sup-
posed to lose themselves in an inland sea.

" The Murrumbidgee River was discovered in 1815, and the Murray
in 1824, by Mr. Hamilton Hume. Afterwards Mr. Hume accompanied
Captain Sturt, when the latter discovered the Darling River; later (in
1831) occurred Captain Sturt-'s descent of the Murray, which has been
already mentioned. Major Mitchell, Mr. Cunningham, and other 'ex--man's JOURNEY ALONG THE sommanu cess'r. 519.

plorers continued the work of investigating the interior of the great
continent, and every year added something to the maps of the country.

"A most perilous journey was made in 1839 and 1840 by Mr. Eyre,
who was afterwards governor of New Zealand and Jamaica. He ex-
plored a portion of the eastern shore of Spencer Gulf, and then turned
to the westward along the shore of the Great Australian Bight, a dis-
tance of twelve hundred miles. Two hundred and fifty miles from the
head of the gulf he had lost foul
of his best horses; and as he could
not carry sufficient provisions for
his party, he sent back his com-
panion, Mr. Scott, and three oth-
ers, and continued the journey
with his overseer, two natives, and
a native servant of his own.

"To make sure of water Mr.
Eyre explored in advance of the
party before moving the animals,
and was sometimes gone five or
six days without finding any.
Most of the horses died of thirst,
and the men only kept themselves
alive by gathering dew with rags
and a, sponge.

'" One night the two natives
armed themselves with guns, killed
the overseer, and ran away,,leav-
ing Mr. Eyre, with his servant,
Wylie,>> two horses, and a very
small stock of provisions; they .
had six hundred miles of un- "Am. m" ,1", 8mm
known desert before them, and
their whole supply of food was forty pounds of flour, four gallons of
water, and part of a dead horse. They had to go one hundred and fifty
miles before finding any more water, and after struggling on for :1.
month, living on horse-flesh, fish, and occasional game, with a little
flour paste, they were rescued by a whaling-ship just in time to save
their lives They remained two weeks on the ship, and then continued
their journey, with more sufferings for twenty- -thiee days, to King
George Sound.
"The next great exploration was that of Captain Sturt towards
the middle of the continent, mentioned in the previous chapter. About
the same time Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, a German naturalist, was fitted
out by private subscription in Sydney, and explored Eastern Queens-
land from its southern border to the Gulf of Carpentarie. In less than
five months he made a. journey of three thousand miles, and was highly
successful in every way. '

 

BXPLORERS IN CAMP-

"Afterwards he started with another expedition to attempt to cross
the continent from east to west, carrying provisions for two years; but
after struggling for seven months he was forced to turn back. Later
he set out again with the same object, but since April, 1848, nothing
authentic has been heard from him or any member of his party. Sev-
eral searching parties were sent out, but beyond a. few trees with the
letter ' L' carved upon them, nothing was ever found to show where he
went, and nobody knows what was his fate; the general belief is that
he and his companions perished of thirst. About the same time Sir
Thomas Mitchell explored a. part of what is now Queensland, and a year
or so later Mr. Kennedy started on an expedition in which he, with most
of his party, was killed.EXPEDITION 0F BURKE AND WILLS. 521

 

KOSUMBRT '10 BURKS AND WILLS, MELBOURNE;

"And now," continued Frank, "we come to Burke and Wills, the
explorers whose monument we saw in Melbourne. The Victorian Gov-
ernment fitted out an expedition in 1860, with Mr. O'Hara. Burke as
chief, and Mr. W. J. Wills second in command. The party consisted of
eighteen men, twenty-seven camels (which had been imported specially
for the service), a great many pack-horses, and several wagons.

" They formed a camp on Cooper's Creek, and left a party in charge
of it, under command of a man named Brahe; Burke and Wills, with
two men, King and Gray, with one horse and six camels, then pushed
on to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and thus made the journey across the
continent. On their return they suffered great privations; Gray died,
and the others were so weak that they hardly had strength to bury
him; the horse was killed for food, four of the camels were abandoned, '
and on the evening of April 21, 1861, the three men crawled into the
camp on Cooper's Creek.

" Imagine their despair when they found the camp deserted, and the
word 'Dic' rudely cut on a tree. They did dig, and found a bottle
containing a letter saying that the camp had been abandoned by Brahe
that very morning. He had left a. few articles of food, but no stimu-
lants, tea, or clothing, of which they were in great need. They rested
a few (lays, and then tried to reach a sheep-station one hundred and
fifty miles away; but they were driven back by scarcity of water, and
both the camels broke down and had to be shot. Brahe returned to the
camp only two hours after Burke and Wills left it; but Burke had
buried his despatches in the hole where the bottle was found, replaced
the earth carefully, and left no sign to indicate that he had been there.
Consequently Brahe supposed the explorers had not returned.

" The Wanderers found some friendly natives who assisted them, but
both Burke and Wills (lied of exhaustion within a few days of each
other, about six weeks after their return to the camp. King joined a
party of nativm, and was eventually rescued and brought to Melbourne.
He was found by one of four search expeditions that were sent out by
the Victorian Government as soon as'it was known that the depot on
Cooper's Creek had been abandoned. Though only one of these expe-
ditions was able to afford assistance to the missing explorers, all made
interesting journeys, and added considerably to the stock of geograph-
ical information concerning the country.

"Since the unhappy termination of the expedition of Burke and
Wills several expeditions have sought to explore Western Australia.
The first man who succeeded in traversing the Great Desert from east to
west was Colonel Egerton Warburton, who started from Alice Springs,
on the overland telegraph route, in April, 1873, and reached the mouth
of the Oakover River, in Western Australia, in the following December.
He had seventeen camels when he started, but was obliged to kill or
abandon all but. three; the party nearly died of starvation, and for a
part of the time Colonel Warburton was so ill that he was strapped at
full length on the back of his camel. The country was a. fearful desert,
the heat was intense, and for hundreds of. miles there was not a drop of
water.

"Forrest, Giles, and other explorers have traversed various parts of
Western Australia; and it may now be said that though there is a. very
large area of unexplored or little-known land, the character of the
whole continent is sufficiently well known for all practical purposes.
Not more than half of it is inhabitable by Europeans, or ever will be.

 

COLONEL WARBURTON STRAPPBD 'I'O ms CAMEL.

Some few districts now considered sterile may be made useful by irri-
gation, but the western half of the continent is an arid waste, where
even the native black man cannot make a living."

Frank paused as he read to Fred the foregoing paragraphs.

" Perhaps you'll have to change the last statement," said Fred.

" Why so 2" queried his cousin.

"Because it does not harmonize with the opinions of some of the
scientific men of Australia," was the reply. " Here is something I have
just found in a, late number of a Melbourne newspaper."
Frank listened with interest while Fred read the following:

" At a recent meeting of commercial and pastoral men in Sydney, an interesting paper
on the Australian Desert was read by Mr. E. Fuveuc. Here are some passages from it:
'In looking back at the past history of Australia, the many disillusions that have taken
place with regard to our knowledge of its geographical formation are very striking. In
no particular is this more noticeable than in the gradual disappearance of the dreaded
desert. Each successive adventurer has turned back with the tale that beyond his farthest
point it was impossible to penetrate, only for after-generations to reverse his opinion and
reclaim the waste land for habitation and settlement. In a pastoral community, from the
earliest ages, the necessity of fresh grazing-lands for the increasing flocks and herds has
existed; and the residents on the border-laud of civilization soon found out that the herbs
and shrubs of the interior possessed qualities hitherto uuapprcciated and unrecognized,
and country looked upon as unfit to sustain animal life became eagerly sought after as
firsvclass fattening country. That this has been the experience of New South Wales and
Queensland has resulted in the shadowy desert being driven into the heart of South and
Western Australia.

" 'That immense areas of spinifcx of the worst description exist in the interior, which
may well be called desert, there is no doubt; but as yet we have no evidence to show that
they are not belts. All through the alleged desert blacks are found all the year round.
Although they can exist on a very small allowance of water, they cannot live without it,
and this proves the existence of a permanent supply throughout the continent, although
the springs that are the source of the supplies may be but scanty drainage and hard to find.
Wherever large reservoirs are found--the standing waters of the interior--fish form one
of the principal native dishes, and they are as a rule so fat as to be almost uneatable. on
these waters, too, wild feathered game are in profusion, from the larger species--geese,
pelicans, native companions, etc--down to the smaller kinds, the little pigmy goose and

" 'Country, then, which can sustain human and animal life throughout the year can
scarcely be classed as an irreclaimable desert; and when we know from experience that
even at their driest stages the edible grasses of this region can keep stock in good condi-
tion, and in the case of some of the grasses even fatten, the future occupation of the whole
of the continent does not seem so very problematicsl. The wonderful success that has
attended boring efforts to the northward of the Great Bight, long considered as the driest
country in Australia, and stigmatized by Eyre as the most awful desert ever troddeu by
man, now being rapidly stocked with sheep, points out the way to the gradual reclamation
of the desert. The knowledge we already have of some of the inland springs, slight as it
is, proves the existence of these subterranean supplies throughout the continent. These
springs are not what are known as surface springs--that is, the residue of a former except
tionally wet season, issuing from the foot of some wellsoaked hill or ridge--but strong
volumes of water that vary not in any season, totally unaffected by drought; in fact, run-
ning stronger during dry weather. I think, therefore, that in most cases a judicious selec-
tion of the site for boring will bring about a successful result; and in this country, so
deficient in surface drainage, we shall find that Nature has provided a store that will ren-
der the settlers independent of variable seasons.' "

" That reminds me," said Frank, " of what Doctor Bronson was say-EFFECTS or CIVILIZATION. 525

ing the other day when we were talking on this very subject. He said
that when he was a boy the maps of the school geographies had a
'Great American Desert' between the Missouri River and the Rocky
Mountains, and another desert between the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra. Nevadas. But as civilization has pushed westward the desert dis-
appe'ared,and all that region once supposed to be uninhabitable is now
occupied as cattle-pastures, and thousands of farms have been estab-
lished and are doing well where fifty years ago it was thought nothing
could be made to grow. Quite likely it will be the same with the great
Australian desert, but as my paragraph represents the present state of
things we will let it remain as it is."

 

DEER! WERY.

The conversation then turned to the aboriginals who had been men-
tioned in Mr. Favenc's address. Fred asked Frank if he had ascertained
how many there were at present in South Australia, and how they
lived.

"Yes," was the reply, "and here is what I've learned. When the
colony was settled, in 1836, there were estimated to be twelve thousand
blacks within its borders. Now the number has diminished to about
five thousand; they have died of diseases of various kinds, and the
annual number of births is considerably less than that of the deaths.
They are protected by the Government, an
official being charged with their care, and
the annual distribution of twenty-five thou-
sand dollars' worth of food, clothing, and
medical comforts from some fifty depots
which have been established for that pur-
pose. _Five special reserves of land, about
six hundred and seventy thousand acres in
all, have been set apart for them, and they
are being taught in the ways of civilization,
just as our American Indians are being in-
structed on their reservations."

"There's one thing we've forgotten 'to
describe in our accounts of the Australian
aboriginals," said Fred.

" What is that 2"

"The boomerang," was the reply. "No
account of Australia is complete without a
description of the boomerang."

"That's so," responded Frank. "But

m W" 01* mellmox- first we ought to see it used."

Fred agreed to this, and in compliance
with their desire one of their Australian friends arranged that they
should see a performance with this remarkable weapon. Here is Fred's
account of it:

"The performer was a half-wild aboriginal who had been promised
a reward for displaying his skill. Our friend explained that there were

 

 

A MOHPJIANG.

several kinds of boomerangs. The differences are in shape and weight;
the variations in shape are hardly perceptible to the eye of a novice,
though readily distinguished by those accustomed to them. The weight
 

fl<7PSeSSg< u=h 0.40:4

A "mam or AmullAX ILAM
varies from four ounces to ten and a half ounces; the blacks of West-
ern Australia used lighter ones than those of the eastern regions.

"Some of the boomerangs are intended for playthings, while others
are for war or hunting purposes. ,The playthings can be made to re-
turn to the feet of the thrower, but the war boomerangs are not expect
ed to return; you can readily understand that a boomerang would be
deviated from its course or stopped altogether by hitting an object, and
if it did not hit anything it would not be of much use as a warlike
weapon.

" We examined the boomerang that the man was to perform with.
It was about nineteen inches long from point to point, two and a half
inches wide in its broadest part, half an inch thick, and weighed eight
ounces and a half. Its shape was somewhat like that of a slightly
bent sickle, the curve being about a. quarter of a circle.

" When we had done looking at it the fellow took it and examined
it carefully, and then he looked at the trees and the grass to note the
direction of the wind. Our friend cautioned us to stand perfectly still,
especially after the weapon had been launched; the performer selects
beforeth the spot where he wishes the boomerang to fall on its re
turn, and sometimes a spectator in his excitement moves to that very
spot and is injured. We promised to obey, and we did.

"Two or three times the man made a. motion to throw it but did
not. Finally, when he felt that he could strike the wind at the proper
angle, he launched the weapon almost straight into the air; it went up
a few yards, then turned and seemed to glide along a little way above
the ground, gyrated on its axis, made a wide sweep and returned with
a fluttering motion to the man's feet. The farthest point of the curve
was about a. hundred yards away. We are told that skilful throwers

can sometimes project the boomerang nearly two hundred yards before
it starts on its return.

"We offered him a sixpence for every time he would bring it back
to his feet and make it fall in a circle two yards in diameter which we
drew on the ground. In ten throws he brought it within the circle four
times, and in the six misses it dropped only a short distance outside.

" He did not throw it the same way every time. Once he made it
skim along the ground for at least fifty yards, then rise into the air
fully one hundred feet, and after making a great curve it returned.
Next he threw it so that it made at least half a dozen great spirals
above him as it came down, and another time it passed around a tree in
its course.ORIGIN OF THE BOOMERANG: . .' 529

" Frank paced off fifty yards from the performer, and placed a shil-
ling in the end of a split stick four feet long, which was then stuck in
the ground just far enough to hold it up. We offered the shilling to
the man if he would knock out the coin without disturbing the stick,
and he did it, but the boomerang did not return.

"Our friend told us that the powers of the return-boomerang had
been greatly exaggerated. The non-returning one is the real weapon,
and is greatly to be feared in the hands of a skilful thrower. It has
been known to hit a man behind a tree or a rock, where he was quite
safe from bullet, spear, or arrow; and if an expert in its use comes with-

in throwing distance of a kangaroo or an emu, the creature's fate is
sealed. -

" He further said he had never known a white man to become ex-
pert in the use of the boomerang, though many had practised with it
for years.

"We asked if the natives ," -. ~ - 'r g
knew how long ago and by f ' ~ '
whom the boomerang was in-
vented. He shook his head '
and said no one could give
any account of it;, but as
all the tribes throughout the
country are familiar with it,
it must be of very ancient
date. He said there was a
theory that the natives de
rived the invention from ob-
serving the peculiar shape and
turn of the leaf of the white
gum-tree. As the leaves fall
to the ground they gyrate,
very much as does the boom-
erang, and if one of the leaves . _
is thrown straight forward, it unicms wno ass fin; reassure.
gyrates and comes back. '

" Such an origin is certainly quite possible. Children might be play-
ing with such leaves, and to please them a man might make a large leaf
of wood, and from this the boomerang may have been developed.
Quien sate ?

"And with this query of 'Who can tell i' we will drop the boome-

34
rang, or leave it in the hands of the aboriginals of Australia, who alone
of all the people in the world know how to handle it."

"That is true as to the return-boomerang," said Doctor Bronson
when Fred read the foregoing account, "but not of the non-returning
one. According to those who have carefully studied the subject, such
a weapon was used by the ancient
Egyptians and by the Dravidian races
of India. The Moqui Indians of Ari-
zona and New Mexico have a form of
boomerang forkilling rabbits, and a
similar weapon is said to be used by
some of the tribes of California In-
. ' dians. The Moqui boomerang resem-
- : bloc theAustralian one in its general

' shape, but it is not a returning one.
It gyrates along the surface of the
ground and is fatal to a rabbit twen-
ty-five or thirty yards away."

" There's something else peculiar
to Australia that you've forgotten,"
remarked the Doctor, after a slight

run-was. on buck-mum) now. pause.

" What is that l"

" It is the platypus, or duck-billed mole," said the Doctor, " the para-
doxical animal of Australia."

"We had not forgotten him," Frank responded, "though we have
not yet written a description of this singular creature. He seems to be
the connecting link between bird and beast, as he has the body of the
mole or rat and the bill and webbed feet of the duck. The female lays
eggs like a, bird, but it suckles its young, which no bird was ever known
to do. The one we saw at Melbourne was larger than the largest water-
rat; they told us that it lives in a. hole which it digs for itself on the
banks of the rivers, is very sensitive to sound, and hard to catch. Its
fur is as fine as sealskin, and if it were larger it would be systematically
hunted for its skin."

"When the first specimens were taken to Europe," said Doctor
Bronson, " it was thought to be a hoax like the Feejee mermaid, and
it was some time befom the naturalists were convinced of its genuine-
ness. When its existence was officially acknowledged, it received the
name of omitkorltg/nchus."
"But isn't there a. question as to whether the platypus lays eggs 2"
Fred asked.

"I believe there is," replied the Doctor, "but the latest student of
the subject, Mr. W. H. Caldwell, of Cambridge College, England, who
visited Australia in 1884--85 for the special purpose, says the creature is
oviparous; so we will rest on his authority."

From Australia in general the conversation changed to South Aus-
tralia in particular. It was directed to the mineral products of the col- V
ony, in consequence of an invitation that had just been received by the
Doctor to visit a famous copper-mine. The Doctor explained to the
youths that copper was the principal mineral resource of the colony:
the exportations of mining
products in the year 1885
amounted to PS344,451, of
which PS322,983 were in .
refined copper or copper ., ; ,
ore. ' ' " '

" Gold has been found
in several localities in the
colony," he continued,
"but never in such quan-
tities as in Victoria or
New South Wales, the an-
nual export rarely ex-
ceeding PS70,000, equal to
$350,000. There are also
deposits of silver, lead, his-
muth, and tin, and many
persons believe that the
colony will ultimately
prove very attractive as none or me DUCK-BILL.

a mining region; but up

to the present time copper is very far in advance of anything else."

They accepted the invitation, and went to the copper-mine which is
known as the Burra-Burrs, and is one hundred and one miles by railway
from Adelaide. Starting at seven o'clock in the morning, they reached
the station near the mine a little past noon, spent three hours at the
works, and returned to Adelaide in the evening. It was a long day
and a wearying one, but the ride and visit were greatly enjoyed.

The Burra-Bnrra mine was discovered by a shepherd name Pickitt, in
1844, and has proved highly profitable to its owners; for a good many
years its annual product of ore was ten thousand tons, yielding two
thousand five hundred tons of pure copper. More than twenty million .
dollars' worth of copper has been taken from this mine, and the supply
is by no means exhausted.

But our friends heard of
even richer mines than the Bur-
ra-Burra. They were told of
the Moonta mines, which paid
from the very start; not a pen-
ny of capital was ever ' sub-
scribed, but the mines have yield-
ed large dividends, in some years
as high as eight hundred thou-
sand dollars, in addition to pay-
ing for costly buildings and ma
chinery. It should be added that
the success of these and other
mines led to a great deal of
mining speculation which was
very disastrous for nearly all
the investors.

Early one Thursday morn-
ing it was announced that the
regular mail steamship of the
Peninsular 6: Oriental Company
was at Glenelg, and would leave
in the evening for King George
Sound,Western Australia. DOG

0" 0? m mmfi- tor Bronson had taken passage

for himself and his young com-

panions; his first intention was ta) stop at King George Sound, but

owing to the limited facilities of travel in Western Australia, the small

population, and the slight development of the country compared to

that of the eastern half of the continent, the idea of making an ex-

tended tour through the only remaining colony of Australasia was
definitely abandoned.

The steamer left Glenelg in the evening of Thursday, and on the
morning of the following Monday arrived at Albany, in King George
Sound, one thousand and seven miles from Adelaide. She anchoredKING GEORGE SOUND. 533

about a mile from shore, and our friends were landed in a row-boat
on payment of one shilling each, the same fare being charged for the
return trip before the departure of the vessel in the evening. King
George Sound is about five miles long and nearly the same in width,
and forms a good anchorage for ships. Its advantages as a naval pos--
session were long ago recognized, the British Government having se-
cured it by establishing a colony there in 1826. There are two en-
trances on opposite sides of an island called Breaksea, a massive rock
that reminded Frank and Fred of Alcatraz Island, in the harbor of San
Francisco, or Capri, in the Bay of Naples.

 

VIEW OF HIM", CAPITAL 0P \vm-nnm AUSTRALIA.

The youths were disappointed with Albany, which they had imag--
ined to be a. place of some importance. It stands on rising ground on
the north shore of the harbor, and has not far from one thousand two
hundred inhabitants--hardly enough to give it the dignity of a city,
which most of its residents claim for it.

Frank asked how they could get away from Albany in case they
had decided to travel through Western Australia

"There is a road from here to Perth, the capital of the colony," said
the gentleman to whom the inquiry was addressed. "The distance is
two hundred and sixty-one miles; and whenever the mails arrive here
they are sent through to Perth by a coach, which makes the journey in
about fifty-three hours. You may travel by the mailcoach, or you can
take a coasting steamer once every fortnight, and touch at all the ports
worth seeing, as well as some that do not pay for the trouble."

" How many railways have they in the colony ?"

"Not many," was the reply. "The Northern Railway, thirty-five
miles long, runs from Champion Bay, on the coast, to the town and min-
ing district of Northampton. The Eastern Railway, ninety miles long,
extends from the port of Freemantle, at the mouth of Swan River, to
Perth, and thence to Beverley, whence it is to be extended to Albany.
There are branches from both these lines, but none of great length, and
there are some private railways belonging to timber companies. All
the lines of the colony are of three feet six inches gauge; several new
lines are projected on the land grant system, in the same way that
many of your railways in the United States have been constructed, and
on some of them work is now under way. But it will be several years
yet before the country has an adequate system of railways."

"Western Australia is territorially the largest colony of Australia,
but there are not yet fifty thousand inhabitants in its whole area," the
gentleman continued. "The largest place is Perth; which has a popu-
lation of about six thousand. Freemantle, its port, twelve miles lower
down on the Swan River, has four thousand, and the other places of
consequence are Guildford, Geraldton, and Roebourne, the latter the
centre of the pearl- -fishe1y. " -

Fred asked what were the products of the country, and how it hap-
pened that Western Australia, while nearer to Europe than any other
colony of Australasia, had been so neglected.

" To your first question I will reply," said his informant, "that wool
is our largest item of export, and then come sandal-wood, lumber, pea11-
shell and pearls, horses, and sheep. We send many horses to India,
Singapore, and Java, and our trade in this line promises to increase.
Our annual exports of all kinds amount to PS290,000, and our imports to
something less than that figure. We have mines of gold, lead, copper,
iron, and tin, but up to the present, though there have been a few gold
rushes, very little attention has been given to our mineral resources, and
we really know little about them.

"There is an abundance of fine country in Western Australia.
There are splendid forests in the south-west, and excellent pasture landsPLANTS THAT KILL SHEEP AND CATTLE. I 535

in the west and north. An American visitor once said that Western
Australia had been run through an hour-glass, alluding to the great
number of sandy regions in the limits of the territory. Of course we
have considerable areas of desert, but his remark is unfair as a. general
description. We could support a. large population, and when our advan-
tages become better known we shall have it too.

 

"BPS! SCENE is THE SOUTH-Wm.

" I ought to tell you that some of our most fertile land in the south-
west is unfit for pasturing sheep and cattle, owing to the poison-plants
that abound there. There are several of these plants, four of them
being well known and easily recognized. The most common is the
York-road plant, a low scrubby bush with narrow green leaves and a.
white stem. Sheep feed eagerly upon it, swell to a. great size, and live
only a few hours; at certain times when the plant is full of sap a single
mouthful is sufficient to kill a. full-grown sheep. The plant will also
kill horned cattle, but does not afiect horses, or only slightly. As you
go to the north you cease to find this dangerous plant, and the pastures
there are as good for sheep as those of Victoria or New South Wales.
"The latter half of your query," he continued, "compels me to
speak of something which the most of us wish to forget. In the first
place, when the colony was formed, in 1829, enormous grants of land
were given to a few individuals of capital and influence who were to
bring out colonists and otherwise
develop the country. The grants
were all the way from one hundred
thousand to two hundred and fif-
ty thousand acres, and the system
proved a bad one. The capitalists
came here to live on their estates,
and not to work, and the colony
was the reverse of prosperous. The
stories of the old colonial days
would be ludicrous if they were
not saddening; of fine gentlemen
and ladies, blooded horses, pianos,
carriages, packs of hounds, and oth-
er belongings of old countries land-
ed on this desolate coast, and no-
body knowing where his allotment
of land could be found. These kid-
gloved colonists ate up all the pro-
visions they had brought, came
near starvation, and then returned
to England, or went to Victoria
and New South Wales to seek new

A mo--oLovxn comm. - homes.

"In the languishing condition
of the colony it was sought to galvanize it into new life by allowing
the Government to send convicts here under the stipulation that there
should be an equal number of free colonists brought out at Government
expense.

"The system was continued until 1868. It was stopped in that year,
partly because no free emigration could be induced to come here as long
as the colony received convicts, and partly because of the opposition of
the other Australian colonies. One of the Governments of the eastern
part of the continent proposed to exclude from its ports all ships that
came from ours, through fear that our convicts would escape to their
shores. Every free immigrant shunned us as he would shun the choleraPEARL-FISHERY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA. 537

or the plague, and if the system had been kept up to the present time
our population would consist almost entirely of convicts and their
guards. All our prosperity dates from the suspension of transportation,
and we want to forget that there was ever anything of the kind."

A desultory conversation followed, in which Frank and Fred learned
many things concerning the colony, but we have not a place for all of
them in this narrative. Talking about the pearl-fishery, they were told
that in 1883 a mass of nine pearls, forming a perfect cross, was found
in Nicol Bay, each pearl being the size of a large pea, and perfect in
form and color. About the same time a rich bank of pearl oysters fif-
teen miles long (the bank, not the oysters) was found in the vicinity of
Beagle Bay, and a single pearl weighed two hundred and thirty-four
grains.

They further learned that capitalists of Melbourne and Sydney had
recently obtained large blocks of land inrthe north, and were sending
their flocks and herds into these new pastures. The climate was claimed

 

IN THE PASHJRE LABDS.

to be delightful, and their informant quoted the words of a clergyman
who averred that it was no exaggeration to say, generally speaking,
that Western Australia possessed one of the most healthful climates in

the world. .
But in spite of its praises they had no wish to remain, and after

strolling through the streets of Albany, looking from the heights in its
rear upon the peaceful waters of King George Sound, and gazing upon
the spot where, with much ceremony, ground had been recently broken
for the railway to Beverley, they walked to the end of the long pier-
which juts into the harbor, and were soon once more on the deck of
the steamer.

Just as the sun was dipping into the west the great vessel left her '
anchorage, passed through the channel at the side of rugged Breaksea,
and then skirted the coast to the westward for several hours. In the
morning Cape Leeuwin, the last headland of the island-continent, was
dimly visible in the distance; before the sun marked the meridian the
cape and all behind it had disappeared, and the great steamer, her only.
companions the sea-birds, ploughed the waters of the .Indian Ocean,
with her prow turned towards the shores of spicy-brewed Ceylon.

As Cape Leeuwin sank from sight beneath the waves our friends
murmured a farewell to the land whose skies are stippled at night by,
the stars of the Southern Cross, and whose arid plains are cooled by
breezes from antarctic seas. And their farewell was accompanied with
the heartiest good wishes for the people whose enterprise and energy
are so admirably exemplified in the populous and busy cities and the
prosperous colonies which have been described in these pages by those
veteran though still young travellers, Frank and Fred.
