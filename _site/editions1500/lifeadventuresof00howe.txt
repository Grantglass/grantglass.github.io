ADVENTURES 

OF 

ALEXANDER SELKIRK 



Alexander Selkirk was born in the year 1676, 
and was the seventh son of John Selkirk, shoemaker and 
tanner, in Largo, Scotland. His mother looked upon 
him as one that would pass through some great events^ 
and she resolved to have him push his fortune at sea, 
where he went in his nineteenth year, to escape the rebuke 
of his unruly conduct. He was from home six years ; 
and again being guilty of very bad behavior, and having 
beaten a young infirm brother, and raised a riot in his fa- 
ther's house, he was publicly reprimanded: upon this, he 
left home, and being a skilful seaman, was appointed 



8 ADVENTtlRES OP ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

Sailing Master, in a vessel called the Cinque Ports — a 
small sailor which went in company with captain Dam- 
pier to the South Sea. 

Having quarrelled with his captain, and having had 
a dream that his ship would be wrecked, he resolved to 
quit it, and was set on shore at the uninhabited island 
of Juan Fernandez, He had scarcely left the boat, when 
he sorely repented, and he " never heard a sound more 
dismal than their parting oars." 

From the beginning to the end of September, the ves- 
sel remained undergoing repairs. The disagreement, 
instead of being made up, became greater every clay, and 
streno-thened the resolution which Selkirk had made to 
leave the vessel. This was accordingly concluded on, 
and just before getting under way, he was landed with 
all his effects ; and he leaped on shore with a faint sen- 
sation of freedom and joy. He shook hands with his 
comrades, and bade them adieu in a hearty manner, 
while the officer sat in the boat urging their return to 
the ship, which order they instantly obeyed ; but no 
sooner did the sound of their oars, as they left the beach, 
fall on his ears, than the horrors of being left alone, cut 
off from all human society, perhaps forever, rushed

upon his mind. His heart sunk within him, and all 
his resolution failed. He rushed into the water, and 
implored them to return and take him on board with 
them. To all his entreaties his comrades turned a deaf 
ear, and even mocked his despair; denouncing the choice 
he had made of remaining upon the island, as rank mu- 
tiny, and. describing his present situation as the most 
proper state for such a fellow, where his example would 
not affect others. 

For many days after being left alone, Selkirk was 
under such great dejection of mind, that he never tasted 
food 'until urged by extreme hunger ; nor did he go to 
sleep until he could watch no longer ; but sat with his 
eyes fixed in the direction where he had seen his ship- 
mates depart, fondly hoping that they would return 
and free him from his misery. Thus he remained seated 
upon his chest, until darkness shut out every object 
from his sight. Then did he close his weary eyes, 
but not in sleep ; for morning found him still anxiously 
hoping the return of the vessel. 

When urged by hunger, he fed upon seals and such 
shell-fish as he could pick up along the shore. The 
reason of this was the aversion he felt to leave the beach, 



14 ADVENTURES OF 

and the care he took to save his powder. Though 
seals, and shell-fish were but sorry fare, his greatest 
cross was the want of salt and bread, which made him 
loathe his food until he got used to it. 

It was in the beginning of October (1704,) which in 
those southern latitudes is the middle of spring, when 
nature appears in a thousand varieties of form and fra- 
grance, quite unknown in northern climates; but the 
agitation of his mind, and the forlorn situation in which 
he was now placed, caused all its charms to be unre- 
garded. 

It was in this trying situation, when his mind, de- 
prived of all outward occupation, was turned back upon 
itself, that the whole advantages of that great blessing, 
a religious education in his youth, was felt in its con- 
soling influences, when every other hope and comfort 
had fled. 

This circumstance ought to lead young people to 
prize their social and religious privileges, as they know 
not but that some day, like Selkirk, their lot may be cast 
far from home, and from pious family opportunities, the 
absence of which were then so much regretted by 
this lonely man. 



ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 16 

By slow degrees he became easy to his fate ; and as 
winter approached, he saw the necessity of procuring 
some kind of shelter from the weather; for even in that 
temperate climate, frost is common during the night, 
and snow is sometimes found upon the ground in the 
morning. 

The building of a hut was the first thing that roused 
him to exertion ; and his necessary absence from the 
shore gradually weaned his heart from that aim which 
had alone filled all his thoughts and proved a help of 
his obtaining that peace of mind he afterwards enjoyed ; 
but it was eighteen months before he became fully 
composed, or could be one whole day absent from the 
beach, and from his usual hopeless watch for some ves- 
sel to relieve him from his melancholy situation. 

During his stay, he built himself two huts with the 
wood of the pimento tree, and thatched them with a 
species of grass, that grows to the height of seven or 
eight feet upon the plains and smaller hills, and produ- 
ces straw resembling that of oats. The one was much 
larger than the other, and situated near a spacious wood. 

This he made his sleeping room, spreading the bed 
clothes he had brought on shore with him upon a frame 



16 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

of his own construction ; and as those wore out, or were 
used for other purposes, he supplied their places with 
goat skins. His pimento bed-room he used also as his 
chapel ; for here he kept up that simple but beautiful 
form of family worship which he had been accustomed to 
in his father's house. To distinguish the Sabbath, he 
kept an exact account of the days of every week and 
month, during the time he remained upon the island. 

The smaller hut, which Selkirk had erected at some 

distance from the other, was used by him as a kitchen in 

which he dressed his victuals. The furniture was very 

scanty ; but consisted of every convenience his island 

could afford. His most valuable article was the pot or 

kettle he had brought from the ship, to boil his meat in ; 

the spit was his own handiwork, made of such wood as 

grew upon the island; the rest was suitable to his rudely 

built house. Around his dwelling browsed a parcel of 

goats remarkably tame, which he had taken when 

young, and lamed, but so as not to injure their health, 

while he kept down their speed. These he kept as a 

store, in the event of a sickness or any accident befalling 

him, that might prevent him from catching others ; his 

sole method of doing vdiich, was running them down by 



ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 19 

speed of foot. The pimento wood, which burns very- 
bright and clear served him both for fuel and candle. 
It gives out an agreeable perfume while burning. 

He obtained fire after the Indian method, by rubbing 
two pieces of pimento wood together until they caught 
fire. This he did, as being ill able to spare any of his 
linen for tinder, time being of no value to him, and 
the labour rather an amusement. Having recovered his 
peace of mind, he began likewise to enjoy greater varie- 
ty in his food, and was continually adding some new 
thing to his store. The craw-fish, many of which 
weighed eight or nine pounds, he broiled or boiled as 
his fancy led, seasoning it with pimento, (Jamaica pep- 
per) and at length came to relish his food without salt. 

As a substitute for bread, he used the cabbage-palm, 
which was plenty on the island ; turnips, or their tops, 
and likewise a species of parsnip, of good taste and 
flavor. He had also Sicilian radishes and watercresses, 
which he found in the neighboring brooks, as well as 
many other vegetables found on the island, which he 
ate with his fish or goat's flesh. 

Having food in abundance, and the climate being 
healthy and pleasant, in about eighteen months he be 



20 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

came easy in his situation. The time hung no longer 
heavy upon his hands. His devotions and frequent 
study of the Scriptures, soothed and elevated his mind: 
and this, coupled with the vigor of his health, and a 
constant serene sky, and temperate air, rendered his life 
one continual feast. His feelings were now as joyful as 
they had before been sorrowful. He took delight in 
every thing around him ; fixed up the hut in which he 
lay, with fragrant branches, cut from a spacious wood, 
on the side of which it was situated, and thereby formed 
a pleasant bower,^ fanned with continual breezes, soft and 
balmy as poets describe, which made his repose, after the 
fatigues of the chase, very gratifying. 

Yet happy and contented as he became, there were 
cares that broke in upon his pleasing thoughts, as it 
were to place his situation on a level with that of other 
human beings; for it is the lot of man to care while he 
dwells on earth. During the early part of his residence, 
he was much annoyed by multitudes of rats, which 
gnawed his feet and other parts of his body, as he slept 
during the night. To remedy this evil, he caught and 
tamed after much exertion and patient toil, some of the 
cats that ran wild on the island. These new friends

23 



soon put the rats to flight, and became themselves the 
companions of his leisure hours. He amused himself 
by teaching them to dance, and do a number of an- 
tic feats* They multiplied so fast too, under his foster- 
ing hand, that they lay upon his bed, and upon the floor 
in great numbers : and although freed from his former 
troublesome visitors, yet, so strangely are we formed, 
that when one care is removed, another takes its place. 

These very protectors became a source of great unea- 
siness to him : for the idea haunted his mind, and made 
him at times melancholy, that, after his death there 
would be no one to bury his remains, or to supply the 
cats with food, his body must be devoured by the very 
animals which he at present nourished for his conve- 
nience. 

The island abounds in goats, which he shot while 
his powder lasted, and afterwards caught by speed of 
foot. At first he could only overtake kids : but latterly, 
so much did his frugal life, joined to air and exercise, 
improve his strength and habits of body, that he could 
run down the strongest goat on the island in a few min- 
utes, and tossing it over his shoulders, carry it with ease 
to his hut. All the by-ways and easy parts of the 



24 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

mountains became familiar to him. He could bound 
from crag to crag, and slip down the precipices with 
confidence. 

With these helps, hunting soon became his chief a- 
musement. It was his custom, after running down the 
animals, to slit their ears, and then allow them to escape. 
The young he carried to the ^reen lawn beside his hut, 
and employed his leisure hours in taming them. They 
in time supplied him with milk, and even with amuse- 
ment, as he taught them as well as the cats to dance; 
and he often afterwards declared, that he never danced 
with a lighter heart, or greater spirit, any where, to the 
best of music, than he did to the sound of his own voice, 
with his dumb companions. ^' 

As the northern part of the island where Alexander 
lived, is composed of high craggy precipices, many of 
which are almost too hilly to climb, though generally 
covered with wood, the soil is loose and shallow, so that 
on the hills the largest trees soon perish for want of 
nourishment, and are then very easily overturned. 
This was the cause of the death of a seaman belonging 
to the Dutchess, who being on the high ground in 
search of goats, caught hold of a tree to aid his ascent, 



ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 27 

when it gave way and he rolled down the hill. In his 
fall he grasped another of considerable bulk, which like- , 
wise failed him, and he was thrown amongst the rocks 
and dashed to pieces. Mr. Butt also met with an acci- 
dent, merely by leaning his back to a tree nearly as 
thick as himself, which stood upon a slope, almost with- 
out any hold of the soil. 

Our adventurer, himself nearly lost his life from a 
similar cause. When pursuing a goat, he made a 
snatch at it on the brink of a precipice, of which he was 
not aware, as some bushes concealed it from them ; the 
animal suddenly stopped ; upon which he stretched for- 
ward his hand to seize it, when the branches gave way, 
and they both fell from a great height. Selkirk was so 
stunned and bruised by the fall, that he lay deprived of 
sensation and almost of life. Upon his recovery, he 
found the goat lying dead beneath him. This happened 
about a mile from his hut. Scarcely was he able to 
crawl to it when restored to his senses ; and dreadful 
were his sufferings during the iirst two or three of the ten 
days that he was confined by the injury. This was the 
only disagreeable accident that befel him during his 
lonof residence on the island. 



28 ADVENTURES OF 

W. Rogers says that Selkirk lay above the goat de- 
prived of sensation, for 24 hours ; Sir R, Steele mentions 
three days. Selkirk, computed the length of time by 
the moon's growth from the last observation which he 
had made on the evening before his fall. 

He occasionally amused himself by cutting upon the 
trees his name, and the date when he was left on the 
island, and at times added to the first the period of his 
continuance ; so averse is man to be utterly forgotten by 
his fellow-man. Perishable as the material was upon 
which he wrought, still the idea was pleasing to his 
lonely mind, that when he should have ended his lone- 
ly life, some future navigator would learn from these 
rude memorials, Alexander Selkirk had lived and died 
upon the island. He had no materials for writing 
wherewith to trace a more ample record. Upon Lord 
Anson's arrival, however at Juan Fernandez, in the 
year 1741, there was not. so far as he observed, one of 
these names or dates to be discovered upon any of the 
trees. 

Abbe Raynal is not correct, when he says that Sel- 
kirk lost his speech while upon the island. All that 
Cook asserts is, that, at his first coming on board, he 



ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 



29 



spoke his words as it were by halves, from want of 
practice; while he states distinctly, that he carried on 
conversation from the first and that his hesitating man- 
ner gradually wore off. 

As to his clothing it was very rude. Shoes he had 
none, as they were soon worn out. This gave him 
very little concern, and he never troubled himself in 
contriving any thing to supply their place. As his oth- 
er clothes decayed, he dried the skins of the goats he 
had killed, to make into garments, sewing them with 
slender thongs of leather, which he cut for the purpose, 
and using a sharp nail for a needle. In this way he 
made for himself a cap, jacket, and short breeches. 
The hair being left upon the skin, gave him a very 
strange appearance ; but in this dress he ran through the 
underwood, and received as little injury as the animal 
he pursued. Having linen cloth with him, he made it 
into shirts, sewing them by means of his nail, and the 
thread of his worsted stockings, which he untwisted for 
that purpose. Thus rudely equipped, he thought 
his wants sufficiently supplied, fashion having no long- 
er any rule over him. His goats and cats being his 
sole companions, he was at least neighbor-like, and 



30 ADVENTURES OP ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

looked as wild as they ; his beard was of great length, 
as it had been untouched since he left the ship. Still 
his mind was at ease, and he danced and sang amongst 
his dumb companions, for hours together ; perhaps as 
happy a man, nay happier, than the gayest ball-room 
could have presented, in the most civilized country 
upon earth. 

One day, in his ramble along the beach, he found 
a few iron hoops, which had been left by some vessel, 
as unworthy to be taken away. This was to him a 
discovery that imparted more joy than if he had found 
a treasure of gold or silver ; for with them he made 
knives when his own was worn out, and bad as they 
were, they stood him in great stead. One of them, 
which he had used as a chopper, was about two feet in 
length, and was long kept as a curiosity, at the Golden 
Head Coflfee-house, near Buckingham Gate, in England. 
It had been changed from its original simple form, 
having when last seen, a buck's horn handle with some 
verses upon it. 

Alexander Selkirk, at different times during his stay, 
saw vessels pass the island ; but only two ever came to 
an anchor. At these times he concealed .himself; but, 



ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 33 

being anxious on one occasion to learn whether the ship 
was French or Spanish, he approached too near, and 
was perceived. A pursuit immediately commenced, 
and several shots were fired in the direction in which he 
fled ; but fortunately none of them took effect, and he 
got up into a tree unobserved. His pursuers stopped 
near it, and killed several of his goats, but the vessel 
soon left the island. Cook says, " The prize being so 
inconsiderable, it is likely they thought it not worth 
while to be at great trouble to find it." Had they been 
French, Alexander would have given himself up to 
them ; but, being Spaniards, he chose rather to stay up- 
on the island, and run the risk of dying alone, and even 
of being devoured by his own cats, than fall into their 
hands, as they would, as he supposed, either have mur- 
dered him in cold blood, or caused him to linger out a 
life of misery in the mines of Peru or Mexico, unless he 
chose to profess himself a Roman Catholic, and even 
then he would have been compelled to pass his weary 
days in one of their coasting vessels in the Pacific Ocean ; 
for as we have already mentioned, it was one of their 
maxims never to allow an Englishman to return to Eu- 
rope, who had gained any knowledge of the South Seas.

34 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

This adventure made him resolve to use more cau- 
tion in future ; never a day passed but he anxiously 
looked out for some sail over the vast expanse of ocean 
that lay before him ; for, even in all his tranquillity and 
peace of mind, the wish to leave the island never entire- 
ly ceased to occupy his thoughts, and he would still 
have hailed the arrival of an English ship with rapture* 

On the 31st of January, 1709, behold ! two English 
ships did heave in sight of Alexander Selkirk's domin- 
ions who was as usual, anxiously watching the watery 
waste. Slowly the vessels rose into view, and he could 
scarcely believe the sight real ; for often had he been 
deceived before. They gradually approached the island, 
and he at len^fth ascertained them to be En owlish. Great 
was the tumult of passion that rose in his mind ; but the 
love of home overpowered them all. It was late in the 
afternoon when they first came in sight, and lest they 
should sail again without knowing that there was a per- 
son on the island^ he prepared a quantity of wood to 
burn as soon as it was dark. He kept his eyes fixed 
upon them until night fall, and then kindled his fire, 
and kept it up till morning dawned. His hopes and 
fears having banished all desire for sleep, he employed

ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 39 

himself in killing several goats, and in preparing an en- 
tertainment for his expected guests, knowing how ac- 
ceptable it would be to them after their long run, with 
nothing but salt provision to live upon. 

When the day at length opened, he still saw them, 
but at a distance from the shore. His fire had caused 
great wonder on board, for they knew the island to be 
uninhabited, and supposed the light to have proceeded 
from some French ships at anchor, with which nation, 
England was then at war. In this conclusion they pre- 
pared for action, as they must either fight or want wa- 
ter and other refreshments, and stood to their quarters 
all night ready to engage ; but, not perceiving any ves- 
sel,, they next day, about noon, sent a boat on shore, with 
€apt. Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed, to ascer- 
tain the cause of the fire, and to see that all was safe. 

Alexander saw the boat leave the Duke, and pull for 
the beach. He ran down joyfully to meet his country- 
men, and to hear once more the human voice. He 
took in his hand a piece of linen tied upon a small pole 
as a flag, which he waved as they drew near, to attract 
their attention. At length he heard them call to him, 
inquiring for a good place to land, which he pointed out, 



40 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

and flying as swift as a deer towards it, arrived first, 
where he stood ready to receive them as they stepped 
on shore. He embraced them by turns; but his joy 
was too great for utterance, while their astonishment at 
his strange appearance, struck them dumb. He had at 
this time his last shirt upon his back : his feet and legs 
were bare, his thighs and body covered with the skins 
of wild animals. His beard, which had not been sha* 
ved for four years and four ncionths, was of a great 
length, while a rough goat's-skin cap covered his head. 
He appeared to them as wild as the first owners of the 
skins which he wore. At length they began to con- 
verse, and he invited them to his hut : but its access was 
so very intricate, that only Captain Fry went with him 
over the rocks which led to it. When Alexander had 
entertained him in the best manner he could, they re- 
turned to the boat, our hero bearing a quantity of his 
roasted goat's-flesh, for the refreshment of the crew. 
During their repast, he gave them an account of his 
adventures and stay upon the island, at which they were 
much surprised. Captains Dover and Fry invited him 
to come on board ; but he declined their invitation, 
until they had satisfied him that Dampier had no com-

mand in this expedition ; after which he gave a reluctant 
consent. 

So great was his aversion to Dampier as a command- 
er after the experience he had of him, that he would 
rather have remained upon his island, its lonely posses- 
sor, now that he was reconciled to his fate, than have 
endured the hardships and trials he had before expe- 
rienced under that navigator. This feeling must have 
arisen, not from any quarrel or personal dislike to Dam- 
pier, but from a knowledge of his former misconduct in 
his adventures, arising from his want of constancy in 
carrying through any object which he professed to have 
in view. 

When he came on board the Duke, Dampier gave 
him an excellent character, telling Captain Rogers that 
Selkirk had been the best man on board the Cinque 
Ports. Upon this recommendation, he was immediately 
engaged on board the Duke. In the afternoon, the ships 
were cleared, the sails bent and taken on shore to be 
mended, and to make tents for the sick men. Selkirk's 
strength and vigor were of great service to them. He 
caught two goats in the afternoon. They sent along with 
him their swiftest runners and a bull-dog ; but these he 



44 



ADVENTURES OP 



soon left far behind, and tired out. He himself, to the 
astonishment of the whole crew, brought the two goats 
upon his back to the tents. 

The two captains remained at the island until the 
12th of the month, busy refitting their ships, and getting 
on board what stores they could obtain. During these 
ten days, Alexander was their huntsman, and procured 
them fresh meat. At length all being ready, they set 
sail, when a new series of difficulties of another kind, 
annoyed Selkirk, similar to those he had felt at his arrival 
upon the island. The salt food he could not relish for 
a long time, having so long discontinued the use of it; 
for which reason he lived upon biscuit and water. 
Spirits he did not like from the same cause; and be- 
sides he was afraid of falling into intemperance, for his 
religious impressions were as yet strong. From the 
confirmed habit of living alone, he kept very much to 
himself, and said little. This frame of mind, and a 
serious countenance, continued longer than could have 
been expected. Even for some time after his return to 
England, these qualities were remarkable, and drew the 
notice of those to whose company he was introduced. 
Shoes gave him great uneasiness when he first came on 



ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 45 

board. He had been so long without them, that they 
made his feet swell, and crippled his movements ; but 
this wore off by degrees, and he became once more re- 
conciled to their use. In other respects he gradually 
resumed his old habits as a seaman, but without the 
vices which sometimes attach to the profession. He 
rigidly abstained from profane oaths, and was much res- 
pected by both captains, as well on account of his sin- 
gular adventure, as of his skill and good conduct ; for, 
having had his books with him, he had improved him- 
self much in navigation during his solitude. 

The articles he took on shore from the Cinque Ports, 
were the following : His chest, containing his clothes 
and a quantity ot linen, now all spent, his musket, 
which he brought home with him ; a pound of powder, 
and balls in proportion ; a hatchet and some tools ; a 
knife ; a pewter kettle ; his flip-can which he conveyed 
to Scotland, (at present in the possession of John Sel- 
craig, his great-grand-nephew ;) a few pounds of tobac- 
co ; the Holy Bible ; some devotional pieces, and one or 
two books on navigation, with his mathematical instru- 
ments. 

In the capacity of mate, he cruised about for a time, 



46 ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK. 

during which several prizes were taken, and on his re- 
turn to London, after an absence of eight years, one 
month and three days, he found himself in possession 
of £800 sterling. As soon as this sum was realized, he 
set out for Largo, and arrived in the spring of 1712, at 
his native villasfe. 

It was in the forenoon of a Sabbath day, when all were 
at church, that he knocked at the door of his paternal 
dwelling, but found not those whom his heart yearned 
to see, and his soul longed to embrace. He set out foj 
church, prompted by his piety and his love for his pa- 
rents ; for great was the change that had taken place in 
his feelings since he had last been within its walls. As 
soon as he entered and sat down, all eyes v/ere upon 
him, for such a personage, perhaps, had seldom been 
seen within the church at Largo. He was elegantly 
dressed in gold laced clothes ; besides^ he was a stranger, 
which in a country church, is matter of attention to the 
hearers at all times. Bat his manner and appearance 
would have attracted the notice of more observing spec- 
tators.— After remaining some time engaged in devotion, 
his eyes were ever turning to where his parents and 
brothers sat, while theirs as often met his gOize ; still they 



* ADVENTURES OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK^ 49 

did not know him. At length his mother, whose 
thoughts perhaps at this time wandered to her long lost 
son, knew him, and uttering a cry of joy, could contain 
herself no longer. Even in the Meeting House, she 
rushed to his arms^ unconscious of the impropriety of her 
conduct, and the interruption of the service. Alexander 
and his friends immediately retired to his father's house, 
to give free scope to their joy and congratulations. 

A few days passed away happily in the society of his 
parents and friends ; but from long habits, he soon felt 
averse to mixing in society, and was happiest when 
alone. Returning, therefore, frequentl^r to KeiPs Den, a 
secluded and lonely valley in the neighborhood, he 
spent most of bis time in solitary wandering and medi- 
tation ; till a new object began to engross much of his 
attention. In his musing by the burnside, he often met 
a young girl, tending a single cow, the property of her 
parents. 

Her lonely occupation and innocent looks, made a 
deep impression upon him. He watched her for hours 
unseen, as she amused herself with the wild flowers she 
gathered, or chaunted her rural lays. At each meeting 
the impression became stronger, and he felt more inter-

ested in this modest female. At length he addressed him- 
self to her, and they joined in conversation ; he had no 
avertion to commune with her for hours together, and 
began to imagine that he could live and be happy 
with a companion such as she. His fishing expe- 
ditions were now neglected. Even his cave became not 
so sweet a retreat. His mind led him to Keil's Den, and 
the amiable Sophia. He never mentioned this adven- 
ture and attachment to his friends ; for he felt a- 
shamed, after his discourses to them, and the profession 
he had made of dislike to human society, to acknowl- 
edge that he was upon the point of marrying, and there- 
by plunging into the midst of worldly cares. But he 
was determined to marry Sophia, though as firmly re- 
solved not to remain at home to be the subject of their 
jest. This resolution being formed, he soon persuaded 
the object of his choice, to elope with him, and bid adieu 
to the romantic glen. 

After this elopement, nothing was heard of him for 
some years. At length, however, a gay widow, of the 
name of Frances Candis, or Candia, came to Largo, to 
claim the property left to him by his father, and pro- 
duced documents to prove her right, from which it appear-

fed that Sophia Bruce lived but a very few years after her 
marriage. He himself, after attaining the rank of Lieu- 
tenant, died on board his Majesty's ship Weymouth, 
some time in the year 1723. 



POSTSCRIPT. 

The chest and cup which Selkirk had with him on 
the island, are in the possession of a family in Nether 
Largo, in Fifeshire, who reside in the house in which 
he was born. The former is in excellent preservation 
although at least 123 years old. It is made of cedar, 
strongly built, and very massy. The initials A. S. are 
rudely carved on the lid. The cup is the shell of some 
kind of nut which probably grew on the island. The 
late Mr. Constable, of Edinburgh, caused it to be much 
adorned and beautified, by giving it a new pendiqle, and 
having its edge surmounted with silver* — Imperial

I am monarch of all I survey, 

My right there is none to dispute : 
From the centre all round to the sea, 

I am lord of the fowl and the brute. 
Oh solitude ! where are the charms, 

That sages have seen in thy face ? 
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,. 

Than reign in this horrible place. 

I am out of humanity's reach ; 

I must finish my journey alone : 
Never hear the sweet music of speech j 

I start at the sound of my own. 
The beasts that roam over the plain, 

My form with indifference see ; 
They are so unacquainted with man, 

Their tameness is shocking to me. 

Society, friendship, and love, 

Divinely bestowed upon man. 
Oh, had I the wings of a dove, 

How soon would I laste you again I

My sorrows I then might assuage, 

In the wajs of religion and truth ; 
Might learn from the wisdom of age, 

And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth. 

Religion ! what treasure untold 

Resides in that heavenly wordi 
More precious than silver or gold, 

Or all that this earth can afford. 
But the sound of the church-going bell, 

These vallies and rocks never heard; 
Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell, 

Or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd. 

Ye winds that have made me your sport, 

Convey to this desolate shore. 
Some cordial endearing report 

Of a land I shall visit no more. 
My friends, do they now and then send 

A wish or a thought after me ? 
O tell me I yet have a friend, 

Though a friend I am never to see. 

How fleet is a glance of the mind ! 

Compar'd with the speed of its flight. 
The tempest itself lags behind, 

And the swift-wing'd arrows of light.

When I think of my own native land, 
In a moment I seem to be there ; 

But alas ! recollection at hand 
Soon hurries me back to despair. 

But the sea-fowl has gone to her nest, 

The beast is laid down in his lair ; 
Even here is a season of rest, 

And I to my cabin repair.

And mercy — encouraging thought ! 
Gives even affliction a grace, 

And reconciles man to his lot.

OF 

THE WAN »E RINGS 
OF 

TOM STARBOAR 



I herewith give my young readers extracts from a 
Httle work under this title, which I think they will find 
entertaining. Mr. Starboard is one of those redoubted 
travellers, w^ho are generally the heroes of their best sto- 
ries, and his adventures are no less varied than wonder- 
ful. Bat we will let him speak for himself: 

" I was two years and a few days wandering over 
South America. I travelled about one thousand eight 
hundred miles ; but I did not walk all the way ; oh no ! 
I frequently went with the Indians up their rivers ; 
and for about five hundred miles I rode on mules, or 
wild horses, which I canght by stratagem. 



58 WANDERI TGS OF TOM STARBOARD. 

" At night I would find a tree, and lace a rope in and 
out of two bou Sj so as to form a kind of cradle ; thus 
supported, I slept in peace, excepting that sometimes 
the vampire bat would annoy me by sucking my blood ; 
he did it though so quietly, that I suffered no pain ; and 
perhaps it was servicable to me to lose a little blood ; it 
is not improbable that these flying surgeons kept me in 
health by their gentle bleedings. The vampire bat does 
not subsist entirely by sucking the blood of living ani- 
mals ; it feeds also on insects and young fruits. 

" One morning, I remember, when I awoke, and was 
coming down from my cradle, I found that a rattle snake 
had coiled itself round the stem of the tree, and then I 
really thought it would be all over with me ; but my 
presence of mind did not forsake me even in this case ; 
for, as the reptile reared his flat, wide, terrible head, I 
took such good aim, and was so near to it that I blew it 
to atoms. Once I caught a poisonous serpent, called a 
labarri snake, that I might look for, and examine the 
fangs, which contained its venom. I saw it asleep ; and 
coming cautiously towards it, I sprang at its neck, which 
I grasped tightly with my hands ; its mouth was thus 
forced open ; then taking a small piece of stick, I pres-

sed it on the fang, (the point of which communicated 
with the root where the bag of poison is situated,) and I 
distinctly saw the venom ooze out : it was of a thick 
substance and of a yellow color; of course I killed the 
creature." 

One day, during my wanderings in South America, I 
came unawares upon a herd of wild horses that were 
grazing quietly on the borders of a forest. Well, — I had 
been walking a long way, and felt tired \ so I thought I 
might as well try to catch one of these horses, and vary 
my mode of journeying, by riding. I had read of the 
manner in which the Guachos (or South American 
peasants) catch these animals with a lasso, or long rope, 
which has a loop at the end of it ; and this they expertly 
throw over the head of the animal that they single out v 
their dexterity is surprising. I feared, however, to at- 
tempt such an exploit, lest I should fail, and thus fright- 
en them all away : besides I had no rope that was long 
enough. 

So I set my wits to work, and thus I tried my 
scheme. I observed among the trees that skirted the 
plain, a pool of water: to this pool I made my way ; forj. 



62 WANDERINGS OF TOM STARBOARD. 

thought I, they will surely come there, by and by, to 
drink ; so I climbed up into a cinchona, or barktree. 

Having fastened one end of my rope tightly round 
one of the lower branches, I made the other into a slip- 
knot or noose ; and then I waited patiently for my ex" 
pected prey. At last the whole herd of horses left their 
pasture in a body, and came neighing and gambling 
towards the water, with their tails sailing in the wind, 
and their long manes waving about with every graceful 
turn of their bodies. I assure you it was rather an ap- 
palling sight to see myself close over the heads of so 
many powerful animals, that made the ground echo with 
their spirited movements. 

I sat still, however, enjoying myself with a calabash 
shell full of milk, which I had drawn from a cow-tree 
that grew on the rock near me. 

" A cow-tree^ Mr. Starboard !" methinks I hear my 
young readers exclaim ; " A cow-tree ! Surely you mean 
a cow grazifig^ Mr. Starboard. We know that travel- 
lers are privileged to tell pretty big stories, Mr. Star- 
board ; but there is such a thing, Mr. Starboard ; as over- 
stepping too far the bounds of truth, Mr. Starboard." 

Upon my veracity, my dear young readers, I am in 




^fe^te^^§(^O^^Sfe^^"^^Sbt^feGy^?#^. 



WANDERINGS OF TOM STARBOARD. 65 

earnest. It was a cow-tree^ from which I drew the 
milk: and the great traveller, Humboldt, will prove 
what I have said. 

The cow-tree is found on the most barren rocks, 
where rains rarely visit it, and it has large woody roots. 
When its trunk is pierced, a most delicious, white, thick 
juice exudes, (or flows out,) which is quite as pleasant 
and nourishing as the milk of our cows. The Indians 
always make use of it, and it is found in the greatest 
abundance about sunrise. 

Well : I had just finished my bowl of vegetable milk, 
when a fine fellow of a horse came under my cinchona- 
tree, and stooped to drink ; so I crept to the end of the 
branch ; and as he raised his head, I slipped the noose 
over his neck, and drew it tight ; the start he gave when 
he found himself confined, frightened his companions, 
and away they all scampered, leaving me and my pris- 
oner alone. 

Instead of striving to break the rope and escape, 
which he might have done with ease, his courage seem- 
ed weakened by this new kind of restraint. I had some 
struggles, it is true ; but I quickly conquered him, and 

we were soon friends.

I have met, in the course of my life with a variety of 
other adventures, which I will narrate to my young rea- 
ders, if they will give their attention. I am an old man 
now and have plenty of leisure ; but the greater portion 
of my life has been passed in unceasing activity and has 
been full of incident : — 

" Up to the north — the polar north, 

With the whalers did I go, 
'Mong- the mountains of eternal ice 

To the land of the thawless snow. 

"We were hemmed in by icy rocks, 

The strength of man was vain ; 
But at once the arm of God was shown 

The rocks were rent in twain. 

" And then we sailed to the tropic seas. 

That are like crystal clear. 
Thou wilt marvel much, thou little child, 

These glorious things to hear,"

THE SHIPWRECK. 

Doubling Cape Horn — A storm — Our Traveller Shipwrecked 
Taken up — Earthquake — Escape to the shore — Adventures 
on shore — Journey to Bonaventura — Safe Arrival. 

Here our friend Tom Starboard in his sailor style, 
gives an account of a remarkable shipwreck. But there 
is nothing better than to let him tell the story himself* 
The account is natural, though it may be a fiction. 

" We did not go through the Straits of Magellan, as 
the passage is dangerous; but we passed them and 
doubled Cape Horn. We went merrilly on, touching 
land, occasionally, to take in water, fruit, and live stock, 
.^ow and then speaking a vessel, or finding some new 
kind of fish, or wonderful bird, till we neared the island 
of Juan Fernandez. Here the weather changed, and 
such a storm came down upon us as I never saw before 
or since. 

" Before it reached its height, and while we were all 
in good spirits, a gust of wind blew my hat off, when 
Ned, to make me laugh, called out, * Tom, your hair 



68 WANDERINGS OF TOM STARBOARD. 

will be blown off too, if you don't hold it on ; my shoe- 
strings have been whisked out this half-hcur.' 

'' But the fury of the storm so increased, as to put all 
laughing and joking out of our thoughts. Night came 
on so rapidly that it seemed as if a mighty black cloud 
had fallen suddenly over us. The gallant vessel which 
had weathered so many storms, struck on a sunken rock, 
and went to pieces, as if she had been made of glass ! 
I got entangled in some loose rigging, which had been 
snapped and unravelled like twine, and this circum- 
stance, which I expected would be the cause of my 
death, saved my life. Part of the topmast was attached 
to the ropes which the furious blast twisted round me, 
as it swept off my shipmates in crowds, into the fierce 
waters : and away I went also, at the same moment, 
with my brave captain ! — 1 never more saw a soul from 
the vessel, nor an atom of her stout planks. 

*' How long I floated in my net work of ropes, I can- 
not tell. I remember the wrath of the panting billows, 
as they were urged onwards by the furious hurricane. 
On they dashed over my defenceless head, throwing 
the shattered mast against my wounded limbs, and 
straining the cords till they cut into my flesh. I remem-

ber, too, that the storm seemed to subside as quickly as 
as it had arisen. Then a noise as if a vessel toiling 
through the waves came over me, and a mixed feeling 
of fear and hope passed through my confused brain ; — 
then a shout and a grappling with my coiling ropes ; — • 
then a sensation of the soft air, and of my mounting 
through it ; — and then a buzz of voices, as I lay in quiet- 
ness on a solid floor. 

" Alas ! how wretched I felt, when I found that all the 
voices were strange, the language foreign, and the faces 
dark and unknown to me. A Portuguese merchant ves- 
sel, bound for the city and port of Guayaquil, had picked 
me up. 

" I cannot describe to you the forlorn state of my feel- 
ings, after the terrible wreck. My own situation, how- 
ever, and the altered mode of my existence, I did not 
consider till I was made to feel it severely, by the coarse 
treatment I met with from those who saved my life. 
I was made to work my way — that I expected, and could 
not complain of — but I felt sadly the difference in the 
manners of the captain and his crew, compared with 
those of the " Speedwell." 

" I thanked the captain for saving my life, and told 



74 WANDERINGS OF 

him I intended to leave the ship. This, to my surprise, 
he said I should not do. I replied that he had no control 
over me ; that I was an Englishman, and could not be 
compelled to serve in a foreign vessel. Then, said he, 
pay me for your passage from Juan Fernandez, and you 
may leave the ship. I told him this was impossible, as 
I had lost every thing in the fatal wreck. At this he only 
laughed in my face, and said ; ' That is not my look 
out ; you shall pay me or stay where you are ;' and with 
an oath, turned on his heel, and left me to my own sad 
feelings." 

Tom determined, at once, to embrace the first oppor- 
tunity to escape. But they had dropped anchor two or 
three miles from the shore, and how could he effect it? 
Besides he was closely watched. But the vessel was 
soon to sail on a long voyage, and being called to take 
his turn, one night in the watch, with two or three 
others, he determined to make the attempt. 

" This night, or never — said I to myself, as I took my 
station. While I was walking the deck, one of my 
shipmates at the mast-head, and the other astern, the 
ship suddenly quivered, as if she were in an ague fit ! — 
down slipped the fellow from on high, and fell flat on ,

his face ; the other rushed forward, and kneeled beside 
him. both crossing themselves and saying prayers to 
their saints. T lost no time, but seizing a board, I hastily 
lashed it to my back with a rope (that when I became 
fatigued with swimming, I might turn and float,) and 
slipping astern, let myself down into the water. The 
noise of the splash I feared would betray me, and I gave 
up all for lost, though the next minute, I found they 
were all praying, and took courage and quietly struck 
off. I made but little headway, however, owing to 
the board on my back. 

" As I continued my toilsome passage towards the 
shore, I heard the loud bellowing of the troubled earth, 
and felt the water jar me, as if it had been a solid sub- 
stance. Suddenly a towering volcano, which I took to 
be Cotopaxi, at above one hundred miles distance, 
appeared illuminated like an immense light-house ; the 
thundering increased, and shrieks and other fearful 
noises were borne to me over the water. At last, when 
nearly exhausted, I was thrown ashore, where I lay to 
recover breath and strength, but oh, the distress and 
confusion that then took place ! Many of the inhabi- 
tants came crowding down to the water's edge, for 



76 WANDERINGS OF 

safety ; houses had been destroyed ; the earth was 
rocking and heaving like an angry ocean ; streams of 
water had gushed out of the ground where no water had 
ever been seen before ; suffocating fumes of sulphur burst 
up under the feet of the terrified and flying sufferers ; 
and when the morning dawned, the face of the country 
seemed changed. Still the town itself (Guayaquil) had 
sustained but little damage, and the inhabitants began 
to return to their dwellings and their business. They 
are so much accustomed to earthquakes all over Peru, 
that it is not surprising they should so soon lose their 
terrors. 

" In the general distress, I met with but little com- 
passion or assistance, which I then thought strange, but 
I had not yet learned that affliction often hardens the heart. 
No one relieved my hunger ; so I ventured to steal a 
handful of nuts from a heap that had fallen out of a 
basket which had been thrown down during the night. 
These I beat between two stones, and mixed with a 
little water ; and this was my food for that day. 

" As I wandered about among the shipping, looking 
in vain for a vessel bound to Europe^ I recollected that 
the bay of Guayaquil is famous for a small shell fish, 



TOM STARBOARD. 77 

about the size of a nut. It is called turbine^ and pro- 
duces a purple dye, reckoned the best in the world. So 
I boldly seized a small boat that was lying at anchor, 
and pushing out into the bay, I caught a few of these 
valuable little fish, and returned to shore again, before 
the owner of the boat had missed it. I was now sure 
of a resource against starving, provided any one would 
buy my turbines. I was soon fortunate enough to find 
a purchaser, so I pursued the plan for several days, 
always taking the same boat, which no one appeared to 
claim. Perhaps the owner, poor fellow, had been de- 
stroyed by the earthquake. 

" I slept every night in a hut close to the sea ; and on 
the fifth morning, I found a French vessel in the harbor, 
which was proceeding on her voyage to Bonaventura 
and to Acapulco, in Mexico. 1 immediately v/ent to the 
captain, and offered to work my way to the port of Bon- 
aventura, if he would give me my passage. And after 
telling him my story, he kindly granted my request ; and 
in due time we reached the port, where v/ith feelings of 
very great gratitude to the captain, I left the vessel."

I had formed the strange resolution of crossing over 
the continent of South America alone, and on foot ! I 
had read Humbolt's Personal Narrative, and I longed 
to see the wonders which he speaks of. Some excuse 
may be made for me perhaps, when it is considered that 
I had a natural fondness for a wandering life and for the 
wonders of nature ; besides, I could meet with no ship 
on this western side of the continent, bound for my 
native country. The French captain, with whom I 
came from Guayaquil, thought me a little deranged ; 
still I believe the good man was glad to get rid of me. 
He gave me thirty francs ; a gun, and some gunpowder, 
saying with a shrug of his shoulder, as he bade me fare- 
well, " You are very courageous ; but remember you 
must eat ; and this gun will be of great use to you." 



WANDERINGS OF TOM STARBOARD. 81 

I provided myself with a wallet, in which to put my 
shoes, stockings, gloves and a shirt ; then inquiring the 
road to Zita, I set out before sunrise, towards the Andes. 
I was five months in crossing the desolate northern ex- 
tremities of those giants of the earth. I bought — nay, 
I did not buy, I found a mule that was browsing on some 
prickly shrub, (I forget its name,) in a wild pass of the 
mountains. She was saddled and bridled, and had evi- 
dently lost her master. I looked in vain for some hours, 
but could find no trace of any traveller, so I felt justified 
in taking possession of her ; and it was well I did, for 
the sure-footed beast took me safely over dangerous pas- 
ses that I never could have crossed without her assist- 
ance. Many times has the creature, with a sagyity 
that was astonishing, stood on the summit of a peak like 
a sugar loaf, looking from side to side ; then slowly ta- 
king aim, has slid down with me on her back, for thirty, 
forty, or fifty feet ! * 

One night, however, she played truant, and slipped 
her bridle, which I always wound round my arm while

I slept, and disappeared, leaving me on the borders of a 

trackless forest. 

At one time, I crossed a mighty torrent that was boil- 
ing along, at the depth of a hundred feet below me, 
through, a narrow ravine ; — and what sort of a bridge do 
yon think I ventured upon ? Two large fragments of 
rocks, one from each side, had fallen together, as I sup- 
posed, during some earthquake, and had formed a natu- 
ral bridge, quite firm and safe over which I crossed. 

Another time I passed a chasm of prodigious depth, 
near an ancient village, the ingenious inhabitants of 
which had constructed a bridge of rushes, in the follow- 
ing manner. Two strong posts were fixed in the rock 
on^ach side, and to these were fastened ropes of rushes ; 
the path upon them being made of the same material, 
platted together. On each side was also a rope for the 
passenger to steady himself by. 

These bridges, in fact, are the origin of our chain or 
suspension bridges, but the elastic and light nature of 
the rushes makes the motion of the bridge very unpleas- 
sant. Indeed when I had one day gone about half way 
across one of them, my head began to swim, and I was 
obliged to sit down to recover myself; for I really 



TOM STARBOARD. 83 

thought I should never reach the opposite side. I sat 
there for some tirne, swinging in a most perilous yet 
ridiculous situation I assure you. 

I wished much to see the interior of one of the mines, 
but they were too far off. The quicksilver mines of 
Huancavelica is particularly curious, having a complete 
town and its cathedral deep in the bowels of the earth. 

I shall not attempt to tell you half the dangers, diffi- 
culties, and troubles I have met with. I made the sun 
my guide by day, and the stars by night. I roosted in 
trees, like the birds, and ate fruit and herbs like the 
beast. I explored mountain torrents, which no human 
beings, probably, had never seen before; found dia- 
monds in their beds, which had been dried up ; conec- 
ted gold from the mud of the rivers, and a great many 
curiosities, which I was obliged to throw away, for want 
of convenience to carry them. I met v/ith tribe^^of Indi 
'ans who had never heard of the name of England, or 
seen an Englishman.

VISIT TO A CAVERN. 

Visit to a Cavern — The Guacharos — Night sounds — Return — An 
alarm — My escape — Thanks for deliverance. 

One evening, during my journey, having refreshed 
myself with some of the fruit that grew near me — for I 
always found food enough in South America, even in 
the forests — I took a fancy to explore a cavern that I saw 
in the rock, near which a cascade tumbled. Resolv- 
ing to be well prepared for any enemy I might meet 
with, I took my gun with me. 

1 ought to tell you, by the way, that after I lost my 
mule, 1 was obliged for some time to content myself with 
a horse. I left him grazing at the foot of a bark tree. 
You have heard of the Peruvian bark, which is used so 
much in medicine, I dare say. I tied my horse, then, to 
a tree which produces this sort of bark. 

Well, all things prepared, I set out on my expedition. 
As I drew near the lofty cavern, I was astonished at the 



TOM STARBOARD. 85 

deafening noise of innumerable wings, and looking up in 
the uncertain twilight, I saw hundreds — I think I might 
say thousands — of birds flying about, preparing to leave 
their home, in search of food. They were the guacha- 
ros. I had read of them in Humboldt's r^rrative, but to 
use the sailor phrase, I had never before • run foul' of any 
of them. They are night birds, that somewhat resem- 
ble our owls, but instead of roosting on trees, these crea- 
tures build in caverns. A sight of them is well worth 
the trouble and danger of exploring one of these dark and 
gloomy mansions. Their noise is prodigious ! 

In fact, one of the most wonderful things a traveller 
meets with in South America, is the different and strange 
sounds at night. The howling monkeys, the night-birds, 
the sharp cries of the jaguars, the roar of the pumas, the 
flapping of wings, the rustling of branches, and other 
noises, are astonishing ! 

How different from the lone solitude of our woods in 
New England, where the only sound, perhaps, that dis- 
turbs the silence of the night, is the distant hooting of 
the owl, or the howling of some dog. Indeed, the great- 
er part of the time, every creature is so silent that yoa 
would scarcely know that any living thing was waking. 



86 WANDERINGS OF 

Well, I stayed so long in the bird cavern, that it was 
quite dark when I got back to my horse, and I had not 
yet made up my nightly fire. So I groped round in the 
dark and collected, as well as I could, some leaves and 
sticks, and began to kindle my fire. But just as I was 
kneeling down to blow at the heap of fuel I had lighted, 
my horse suddenly started, drew back to the full length 
of his cord, rolled his eyes, enlarged his nostrils, threw 
his ears forward, erected his main and tail, and stood 
there the very picture of terror. " There is danger now," 
thought I ; but I was resolved to meet it. So I jumped 
up instantly, and looking into the gloom, in the direction 
which my horse's eyes took, 1 saw a dark mass of some- 
thing moving slowly along among the bushes. 

I was up the tree instantly. I assure you, taking with 
me my gun, which I had rested against its trunk. For 
a minute or two all was quiet. Soon, however, the dark 
body approached a little nearer, but so quietly, that I 
should have thought very little more of it, had not my 
horse shown symptoms of so much alarm. I levelled 
my piece and fired, and, as I suppose, wounded the 
animal ; for he bounded up, and darted oflf into the

Just at this moment the fire burst into a bright blaze, 
which kept the wild animals away for the rest ol that 
night. I did not rest or sleep very well, however, for I 
had used the rope that I commonly tied myself with, to 
fasten my horse. One thing, however, you may easi- 
ly suppose, I did not forget to do ; which was to give 
thanks to my great Preserver, who ^guides the helm^ 
as we sailors say, by land, as well as by sea.

RA'VELS AMONG THE INDIANS 



The Steppes — New troubles — "Bad water — Eating clay and ants. 

I came at last to the dreary plains of South America, 
called Steppes, and here my troubles were unusually 
severe. All kinds of stinging insects, serpents, and 
loathesome reptiles annoyed me ; besides 1 could hardly 
get food and drink. Sometimes, though rarely, I was 
so fortunate as to find a plant resembling the aloe, con- 
taining a quantity of pure water in its stem ; but when 
I could not get this, I was obliged to drink the horrible 
water of the rivers, swarming with animalcules (little 
creatures almost too small to be seen by the naked eye) 
to such a degree that I seemed to swallow about as much 
solid matter as liquid. As to food, I was contented, 
often, to swallow little balls of earth, as the natives do ; 
for though it would be disgusting now, it served then, 
to keep the breath of life in me. It is a very fat, buttery 
kind of earth, and is prepared for food by baking it

slightly in the fire. You are aware, I suppose, that the 
natives of Japan, Siberia, Africa, and other parts of the 
world, also sometimes eat clay. 

After travelling a long time, I came unexpectedly upon 
a wandering tribe of Indians, consisting of only three or 
four families ; and, entering one of their wretched huts, 
built of clay and leaves, I asked them for food. 

At first they did not understand me, but with the help 
of signs, I soon made them comprehend that I was 
hungry ; upon which one of them took down a bag 
containing a kind of greasy, spotted, whitish paste, gave 
me some of it, pointed to the fire, and went and lay 
down in his hammock, which with fourteen others was 
slunof from some beams above. 

I was so tired and wet, for it was now the rainy season, 
and so glad to find something to eat better than clay, 
that I was going to cram it down, when I saw unex- 
pectedly that the black spots on it were large ants. I 
threw it down instantly ; but soon recollecting that a 
'paste mixed with ants, is represented by Humboldt as a 
very common food among some of these tribes of Indians, 
and feeling impelled by hunger to eat something, I at 
last eat a small quantity of it.

These were the laziest sort of people I ever met with. 
They seemed to have no wants, beyond mere eating 
and drinking ;* they have no clothes to mend, or domestic 
cares to attend to ; no fishing, no hunting to prepare for* 

I quitted them as soon as I could, I assure you, for 
they were almost too lazy to furnish me with food ; 
besides, I was not without fears, from the accounts'given 
by other travellers, that they would master energy 
enough to kill me for food, as a treat ! 

Before I left them, however, I was greatly rejoiced, 
one day, to hear the word "Orinoco;" for, on inquiry, 
I found by signs that this long wished for river was only 
a little way to the south. 

* I know we have some just such people as this in every country, 
at least in every one that I have seen ; but here they were all 
stupid. There were no active and industrious persons among 
them.

BIRDS AND BEASTS OF SOUTH AMERICA. 



Bathing—A shock— Electrical Eel— The Bell-bird— The Sloth- 
how slandered. 

One day, about noon, as I came to a pleasant looking 
pond or lake, beautifully over-shadowed with trees, the 
thought struck me that I would take a bath. But I had 



92 WANDERINGS OF 

scarcely entered the water, before I felt a shock like that 
of an electrical machine, and a very severe one, too. 

"An earthquake?" you will perhaps say. By no 
means. The shock was given by an electrical eel. 
However, it instantly took away all my strength, and 
nearly all my senses, too ; and I believe, in my heart, 
I should never have been here, but for help. It was 
close to a Missionary village, and an Indian woman 
happening to come down to the pond to dip up water, 
just at that moment, and guessing my situation, lost no 
time in dragging me out before the animal h^d;an op- 
portunity of repeating his shocks. / 7 ^ -.. .-,,, 

I had now reached a better country. The mornitig^ 
especially, were uncommonly beautiful. Birds of every 
color greeted my ears with their songs ; and among 
the rest, I particularly noticed the cotnpanion or bell- 
hird. Perched on the top of a lofty mora tree, this bird 
used to awaken me by his clear ringing note that sounds- 
exactly like a fine toned bell, and may be heard two or 
three miles. He is white, with a black spire on his 
head, and about three inches in length. 

Among other creatures that arrested my attention, was 
the harmless, but misrepresented and slandered sloth, I

used often to see him looking down in my foce from the 
lofty trees, where he feels most at home and most happy. 
It is true that after he has been caught and put on the 
ground, he is a dull lazy animal ; for he is out of his 
element, almost as much as a fish out of water, or a 
human being in it.

But I will give you a few more particulars of this 
animal. He is formed to live on trees, and is never 
found any where else, unless by force or accident. While 
the weather is calm, he remains suspended or hanging" 
from the branches ; but during a high wind, when the 
boughs of the closely grovv^ing trees are shaken and laced 
together^ as it were, he passes from one to the other with 
ease and quickness. He never moves iqjon, but imider 
the branches ; he hangs there to rest, to eat, and to sleep. 
The color of his fur is so nearly that of the moss on the 
bark, that it is not easy to discover him, except when he 
is moving. In short, instead of being an object of dis- 
gust, or even of pity, I do not know a creature that 
appears more happy, as long as man and other animals 
will let him alone. It is man, by his " meddling" that 
makes a great many of the woes that his fellow animals 
feel. It is guns and snares, and traps, and aviaries, and 
cages, that make birds and beasts most unhappy.

THE WILL-O'-THE-WISP. 

India rubber shoes — Aloe-leaf hats — Will-o'-the-wisps — What 
they are. 

I had now been so long in the forests and among the 
Indians, that I began to be in want of some of those 
things that are only to be found in the abodes of civil- 
ized men. My shoes, in particular, began to fail me ; 
and I dreaded the idea of going barefooted day after day. 

But as good luck would have it, or rather, perhaps I 
ought to say, as a kind Providence designed it, I fell in 
with an India rubber tree, into which somebody had 
made incisions, and from which the gum was now flow- 
ing. So I let it flow upon my shoes, in order to form a 
new sole. In this undertaking, however, I was not 
quite so successful as in making a new hat to supply the 
place of my old one. I found a species of aloe, from 
the tough thick leaves of which, by splitting them I made 
me a very good hat, especially for the dry season. In 
the rainy season, it would not have been quite so com- 
fortable, I suppose. 



96 WANDERINGS OF 

One nightj as I had taken up my quarters on the verge 
of a forest, and had got seated in my cradle, which 
you know was among the thick branches of some huge 
tree, I saw a Hght glancing among the trees. I came 
down from my roosting place, almost in an instant, and 
went towards it, hoping there was a village near ; for I 
was sadly in want of a better rope to fasten myself with ; 
and the Indians of these villages make some very ingen- 
ious ones, by twisting together the long fibres of the 
leaves of the cocoa-tree. 

Well, as I said, I followed the light, but ivhere^ do 
you think ? Why out of the forest, to be sure, but into 
something worse than a forest. I found myself, ere I 
was aware of the nature of my guide, up to my knees in 
a quagmire : and what was more mortifying still, I was 
not much nearer the light than when I set out. 

I began now to suspect what it was. It was evidently 
one of those things to which they give the name oiignus 
fatuus^ or will-d'-the-iDisp. They are seen, as you 
know, (and as I might have known had my wits been 
about me) in low swampy places, peeping and dodging 
about. They are supposed to be gaseous ; but perhaps 
you do not all of you knov/ what gaseous means ; and I 
am hardly philosopher or chemist enough to tell you. 



TOM STARBOARD. 95 

The atmosphere or air which we breathe is composed 
of two ingredients, or gases, as the chemists call them. 
One is oxygen. This is the supporter of life and flame, 
for if it could be taken out of the air we could not 
breathe again, and every candle and lamp would be 
extinguished in a moment. The other is nitrogen or 
azote, which destroys life. 

I told you the air we breathe was made up of these 
two airs or gases; and it is. But many other gases 
sometimes float in it. One of these is hydrogen. It is 
produced in various ways, and is one of the most inflam- 
mable substances in the world. Now electricity, (or 
lightning, for it is the same thing) which is a subtle or 
penetrating fluid, always exists in the atmosphere, and 
has at all times power to ignite (set on fire) a vapor so 
inflammable as hydrogen, if it happens to come in con- 
tact with it. Now, again, as this hydrogen gas is most 
readily produced by the decomposition of water, and 
combines or mixes v/ith various other matters arising 
from decaying vegetation, putrifying animal substances, 
in low and marshy swamps, a tiny spark is sufficient to 
ignite these combined gases, and thus set off the Will- 

o'-the- Wisps.

THE AEROLITES, 



Stones falling— Where they come from — Arrival at the river 
Orinoco. 

Well, I extricated myself from the quagmire and re- 
turned, — though not without some difficulty, I had wan- 
dered so far, to my roosting place. The next morning 
as I was preparing to descend the tree, the sky being 
clear, and the sun shining, I was alarmed by a hissing 
noise in the.air ; and looking quickly around, I was just 
in time to see an immense mass of something, I could not 
tell what, falling from above, with a loud noise, and 
crushing in its fall, the branches of a lofty tamarind tree 

Hastening to the spot, I found, to my surprise, an 
enormous piece of metal, quite hot, which had fallen 
with such force that it lay half buried in the swampy 
ground. 

I stood lost in wonder. When I was a boy, I had of- 
ten picked up lumps of metal on the Wiltshire Downsj 



TOM STARBOARD. 97 

in England, but though told they were aerolites, I did 
not at that time believe a word of it. "Can the thin 
pure air," thought I then, " form such hard bodies ? Or 
can there be great iron mountains, and forges, and black- 
smiths, and every thing of that sort, up in the air ?" 

But now a huge mass lay at my feet. I had seen it 
fall. It was still hot. The boughs of the tamarind tree 
lay scatteried about in every direction. How could I 
doubt any longer ? Was it reasonable to deny facts, be- 
fore my eyes, because I could not account for them ? 

Do you wish to know if I can account for them 7ioio ? 
Not a whit better. The moon, some say, has volcanic 
mountains which throw them out. But I don't believe 
it. Think what an immense force of pressure it must 
take to send up a huge stone from one of our volcanoes, 
quite beyond the sphere of the earth's attraction, so as to 
be met by the attraction of the moon and be carried to 
it ! Do you believe such a thing could ever happen ? 

Nearly all we know about it is briefly this. Heavy 
bodies, of every variety of size, from an ounce to 300 
pound's weight, have at different times fallen from the at- 
mosphere. These heavy bodies are really composed of 
earth and metals. They all contain the same substances, 



98 WANDERINGS OP 

though sometimes varying a little in the proportions ; viz. 
iron, nickel, manganese, silica or silex, sulphur, magne- 
sia and lime. 

Perhaps I ought to add that though I know nothing 
more about these wonderful phenomena, it is more gen- 
erally believed that these substances are formed in the 
vast regions of the atmosphere^ by causes unknown ex- 
cept to Him who created the atmosphere, " in whom we 
live, and move, and have our being." 

Soon after my last adventure I arrived at the Mission 
villages on the banks of the river Orinoco. Here I met 
with a Spanish gentleman of distinction, by the name of 
Don Calao. He was a merchant, and sold monkeys, 
mackawSj turtles' eggs, &c., very odd things for a man to 
trade with, as I then thought. I have something to say 
about turtles' eggs in my next letter.

THE HARVEST OF TURTLe's EGGS. 

You would wonder how there could be any turtles 
remaining in South America, if you wore to see the 
thousands and thousands that are destroyed by the Indi- 
ans every year, at the Harvest of Bggs, as they call it. 
I attended one of these hunts or harvests, one day, with 
Don Calao the merchant, and saw the whole process, 



100 WANDERINGS OF 

We all went in a boat, early one morning, to an Island 
in the river, where the sand was smooth, and which the 
tide had left bare. A person then took a long pole, and 
walked about, thrusting it into the sand, in every direc- 
tion, and wherever it penetrated easily, he knew there 
was a nest of turtle's eggs. So then they dug down, and 
when they found any, they put them in a basket which 
they brought for the purpose. 

Numbers of Indians were there, from all the neighbor- 
ing shores, and immense numbers of eggs were collected. 
They make a kind of oil of the yolk, which is used in 
cooking, as well as for burning in their houses. 

It is supposed that not fewer than a million of turtles 
lay their eggs at the mouth of the great river Orinoco. 
More than three millions of eggs were taken the year I 
was there. Each turtle lays, on an average, seventy 
eggs. You may be surprised that out of seventy mil- 
lions of eggs laid, only three millions were taken. But 
so many are broken, so many hunted out and devoured 
by the jaguars and other animals that feed upon them, 
that the wonder is, rather, that we find the vast number 
that we do. Many escape and are hatched however, for 
I saw in one instance, the whole shore of the OrinocOj 



TOM STARBOARD. 101 

swarming with little turtles, just hatched, and scram- 
bling towards the water to escape from the Indian chil- 
dren who were catching them. 

The turtles lay their eggs during the nigjit^'ln large 
holes, which they scratch in the sand. They then cover 
them up, and leave them to be warmed into life by the 
sun. The eggs are larger than pigeons' eggs, and when 
well preserved, by slightly boiling or by drying in the 
sun, are very pleasant food. 

We saw some large shells of turtles which the jaguars 
had emptied as neatly as if the flesh had been cut away 
with a sharp knife. Those animals hunt the poor crea- 
tures, catch them, turn them on their backs — you know 
they cannot turn back again — and then devour them at 
their leisure.

THE ANIMALS. 

[Animals of South America — Jaguar — Water Hog.] 
The same day that we went to the egg harvest, as we 
were saiUng along on the river, we saw a jaguar feast- 
ing on a chiquire or water hog, and a large flock of vul- 
tures hovering round him, as if they grudged him every 
mouthful he swallowed. Finally they troubled him so 
much, that he took up his prey and carried it off int© 
the adjacent forest. 



TOM STARBOARD. 103 

But I found creatures in South America, more terri- 
ble than serpents, jaguars, or crocodiles. You will 
wonder, perhaps, what they could be. Then I'll tell 
you. They were musquetoes, white flies, and ants. 

Musquetoes are indeed troublesome every where ; but 
nowhere that I have been — and I have been in all parts 
of the world — so much so as in South America. Why, 
we seemed to breathe thenfi, almost, instead of air. We 
were never free from them except at midnight ; and then 
other insects, huge bats, and jaguars, kept us in continu- 
al alarm. 

Sleeping rooms there, are sometimes built on poles, or 
scaffolding, higher than these cruel insects ever fl}^, 
which is found to be about twelve feet from the level of 
the rivers ; and in these apartments we were able to ob- 
tain a little breathing comfort. Vast regions of the coun- 
try are rendered uninhabitable by the different species of 
tormenting animals which infest it. When two persons 
meet in the morning, the first question often is. " How 
are you to-day for the musqnitoes ?" I have had both 
my legs swelled to a most enormous size, by the bites of 
these animals. 

In some parts of the country the Indians bury them- 



104 WANDERINGS OF 

selves, all but their heads, in the sand while they sleep ; 
in others, they assemble all the cows in the village, and 
pass their nights among them, for it is found that they 
are not so troublesome in the neighborhood of cattle. 

Sometimes they build a kind of oven, without doors or 
windows, having only a little hole, through which they 
creep on their hands and knees. They then light a fire 
in it of wet brushwood, which makes a great smoke and 
drives off the insects ; then closing the door of the oven, 
they go to sleep. But I could not endure the smoke as 
well as I could the musquetoes. 

As to the white flies ^ they are so very small, that if 
you were to use musquetoe curtains, they would have to 
be wetted to prevent these tiny creatures from making 
their way through the threads. Their sting is exceed- 
ingly painful. 

The termites is a sort of ant that eats paper, paste- 
board, parchment, &c., so that there are no ancient re- 
cords of the countries in which they are found. But 
there is another species of ant which devours juicy green 
leaves, such us sallads ; so that when the inhabitants 
wish for a few dishes of pleasant cooling herbs, they 
make a garden in the air. 



TOM STARBOARD. 105 

You will smile, but I assure you that I state nothing 
but what I have seen. They procure an old boat, or 
some frame of that description, raise it on dr^^ poles, then 
fill it with earth, and sow their seeds. The destructive 
ants, travelling as they do in bands, not knowing there 
is any thing growing above, pass by these bare poles or 
supporters, and the plants are saved.

BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS. 

Some beautiful animals in South America — The Titi Monkey 
The Widow Monkey — End of the Journey. 

By this time I fear you will begin to think that there 
is nothing to be found in all South America, but dan- 
gerous passes, savage men, ferocious beasts, venomous 
serpents and reptiles, and troublesome insects. But you 



TOM STARBOARD. 107 

are mistaken. Humboldt would tell you so. Wood- 
bridge, too, in his geography says that " the finest fruitSj 
the most beautiful vegetables, and the largest and loftiest 
trees, are found in the Torrid Zone," and much of South 
America lies, you know, in this zone. He says also, — 
and he says right, — that it produces not only the fiercest 
and most dangerous animals, and the largest and most 
venomous serpents and insects, but soTne animals which 
are among the '• most beautiful" in the world. 

I think one or two of the monkey race which I saw, 
are among the most beautiful of the animal kingdom. 
One species, called the Titi, pleased me particularly. It 
is very small ; its hair is of a beautiful golden color; and 
it is a more striking resemblance to a child than any 
thing I ever saw in my life. It is also very timid, and 
when any body alarms it, its large eyes fill with tears.* 

The Titis are very fond of insects, particularly of spi- 
ders. It is said — but I cannot vouch for the truth of it — 
that when an engraving of an insect on which it feeds 
has been shone it, it would dart out its paw in hopes of 

• This is very remarkable, if true. Young naturalists, is our 
traveller correct?

catching it; but that when pictures of those on which it 
does not feed are presented, it takes no notice of them. 

The Titi Monkey is also very fond of warmth. If 
several of them are confined in a cage, and a cooling 
shower comes on, they crowd together, and twine their 
legs and tails round one another, to keep themselves 
warm ! One that was tamed used to run after a person 
that wore large sleeves to get into them ! The Indians 
say that they sometimes meet groups of ten or twelve of 
them in the forests, crying terribly, because those on the 
outside want to get in the middle to be warmer. 

There is another beautiful animal of the same race 
called the Widow Monkey. Its hair is black, soft, and 
glossy ; its face is of a whitish color ; the neck has a 
band in front, about an inch broad, the hinder feet are 
black, and the fore feet white. In these white marks on 
the black monkey, the inhabitants imagine they discover 
the veil, the handkerchief, and the gloves of a widow in 
mourning. ^ 

But perhaps you are tired of my storied, and wish to 
come to the end of my journey. Well the rest is quick- 
ly told. Don Calao, the Spanish gentleman, very kind- 
ly assisted me in getting down the river, to the Island of 



TOM STARBOARD. 109 

St. Thome, near its mouth, where I was so fortunate as 
to meet with a merchant vessel bound to my native 
country. I procured a passage, and after a long and 
rather boisterous voyage, reached home in safety.
