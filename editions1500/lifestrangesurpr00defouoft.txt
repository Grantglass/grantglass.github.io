who lived eigllt-and-twenty v.-ar^ all alm- in an unin-

of the great River Oroonoque : having be.-n Gad 
by shipwreck, wherein all the men peri-hed ] m t him 
an account how he was at la>t strangely delivered l<v Pirates. 
( A Vr it ten by himself." 

Like "Paradise Lost," this romance, destined in to iinm<"iiuto and 
lasting a popularity, is said to have been offered to " the whole eirele 
of the trade" before any publisher could be found willing to incur 
the risk of producing it. William Taylor, of the Ship, in 1 
finally agreed to purchase it, for, it is believed, a very moderate >um of 
money. He is said to have realised 1,000 profit. Its sue. so great 

that four editions were printed in as many months. It appeared, in the 
instance, with the following preface : 

If ever the story of any private man's adventures in the world were worth making 
public, and were acceptable when published, the Editor ( f this account thinks this will 
be so. 

The wonders of this man's life exceed all that (ho thinks) is to In- f.. : ; the 

life of one man being scarce capable of a great- T variety. 

The story is told with modi-sty, with >.Ti.msnc>-i, and with 

events to the uses to which wise im-n ahvays apply tln-iu; vi/.., to th> in-tin hors, 

by this example, and to justify and honour tin- wi<dom of IWid-n.-.- in ftO 
circumstances, let them happen how they will. 

The Editor believes the thing to be a just hUiory of fart ; n.-itli

There is no truth in the story, so often repeated, that " Kolin*on ( Y 
was the first tale published in a serial form. That it did appear in a Journal called

the endeavours of envious people to reproach it with being a romance, to s -arch it 
for erron in geography, inconsistency in the relation, and contradictions iu HIM t'.i.-t, h. im- 
proved abortive, and as impotent a< malicious. 

Tho just application of every incident, tho religious and useful inferences drawn from 
every part, are so many testimonies to the good design of making it public, and must 
legitimate all tho part that may bo called invention or parable in tho story. 

Tho second part, if tho Editor's opinion may pass, is (contrary to tho usage of second 
part*) every way as entertaining as the first; contains as strange and surprising incidents, 
and as great a variety of them ; nor is the application less serious or suitable ; and doubtless 
will, to tho sober as well as ingenious reader, bo every way as profitable and diverting ; and 
this makes tho abridging this work as scandalous as it is knavish and ridiculous ; scoing, to 
shorten the book, that they may seem to reduce tho value, they strip it of all those re- 
flections, as well religious as moral, which are not only tho greatest beauties of tho work, 
bat are calculated for the infinite advantage of tho roa<l< r. 

!'> this, they leave the work naked of its brightest ornaments ; and yet they would 
(at tho same time they pretend that tho Author hoa supplied tho story out of his in- 
volition) take from it tho improvement, which alono recommends that invention to wise .-MM!

INTRODUCTION. 



De Foe, says, "His real name was Scleraig, which In- changed to that of Selkirk, 
when he went to sea. He was born at Largo, in the county of Fit.-, in U576, 
and, after a common school education, was put to his father's I.IIMM.'^, which 
was that of a shoemaker. Being a spoiled child, he soon discovered a wayward- 
ness of temper that gave much uneasiness to his paivnts; whiUt an carlv pro- 
pensity to the sea rendered his employment irksome. At length an incident 
occurred that put him upon indulging his humour; for, being brought un l-r 
church-censure for irregular conduct when lie was eighteen years of age, rather 
than submit, he suddenly left home, and was never heard of for six years. It 
is supposed that he was with the buccaneers in the South Seas. In 17>l w; I'm I 
him again at Largo, but the same intractable person as ever, being engaged in 
constant broils with his family. As the sea was his favourite el-mcnt. h- di-i 
continue long in Scotland, but, going to London, engaged with Captain I)ain 
upon a cruising expedition to the South Seas. This was the voyage that rend. 
his subsequent history so interesting to the lovers >f romance. 

" Being appointed sailing-master of the Cinque Ports galley, a companion 
to the St. George, commanded by Dampier, he left England in the spring of 
1703, and, after various adventures, both vessels reached the Man-1 of Juan 
Fernandez in the following February. After staying some time to re-tit, t 
sailed again in quest of booty ; but a violent quarrel :iri>ing between Selkirk and 
his commander, Stradling, which settled into a rooted animosity, the for 
resolved to take the first opportunity of leaving the vessel. This occurred at the 
beginning of September, 1704, when her crazy state obliged Stradling to return 
to Juan Fernandez for fresh repairs ; which being completed, Selkirk bid a final 
adieu to his comrades at the end of the same month. Upon this island he lived 
by himself four years and four months, until he was released by Captain W<- 
Rogers, in the month of February, 1709. He was then M :i mat 

board of Rogers' ship, the Duke, and accompanied him during the remainder of 
the expedition, conducting himself much to the satisfaction of his employer. At 
length, after a long and fatiguing cruise, Selkirk arrived in England, in the 
month of October, 1711, with a booty of *>oO, aftec an absence pf rather D 
than eight years." 

Like Crusoe, Selkirk could not settle to a quiet lite on shore : hi- 
less nature drove him again to sea ; and he is said to ha\e died on board >hip in 
1723. On his first appearance in London he attracted a good deal of attention. 
and Sir Richard Steele gave an account of lii^ iv-Mcncr on the i-lan>l, and his

ings while there, in a |>aper published in a journal called "The English- 
man 

\\V di not attach the slightest importance to ;i story dictated by the male- 
\oleiiceofDo Foe'* political enemies, that Selkirk placed a manuscript, detailing 
lii-> ad\ futures, in DC Foe's hands tor publication; but that, instead of doing 

ice to him, he applied the materials so obtained to his own use. The best 
authorities have deliberately rejected this idle talc. 

In so far as Selkirk passed a certain number of years on an uninhabited 
Nand, he may be truly said to have furnished the idea of Crusoe; but if we are 
compelled to admit that he is the central figure in the picture, the subordinate 
figures, the grouping, and the scenery are altogether due to the genius of 
De Foe. Herein lie affords an exact parallel to Shakespeare, who derived the 
plots of his immortal dramas, uow from an Italian romance, now from passim: 

:its. 

Whatever may have been the origin of the tale, however virulent may have 
been the attacks made against its author, as he himself says, by political enemies 
ind senseless critics, the judgment of the most enlightened men of all nations 
has placed " Robinson Crusoe" upon a height which no sounds of animosity can 
now reach. What pleasure ha> this wonderful tale given, and still gives, to all 
readers! Young and old. rich and poor, find in its pages an unfailing source of 
pun- delight. 

If blend-* instruction \\ith amusement in a way no other production of human 
intellect has e\er succeeded in doinif. \Vliilc depicting a solitary individual 
struggling again -t misfortune, it indicates t lie justice and the mercy of Providence : 
and while inculcating the duty of self-help, asserts the complete dependence of 
man upon a higher power for all he stands in need of. 

If we consider novels in their relation to life. Uobin>,, M Crusoe" must win 
flif pri/e for truthfulness mid reality. How naturally the incidents occur . 

is no defer, ne,. shown by the author to the cxi^enci,., of his story, nor 
to dramatic effect. The characters appear as they do in real 1; is,- 
influence fur good or evil on the principal figure in the tale -and then

INTRODUCTi 



My friend*, do they now and then send 
A wish or a thought after me ? 

Oh ! tell mo I yet have a friend, 
Though a friend I am never to see. 

How fleet is a glance of the mind ! 

Compared with the speed of its flight, 
The tempest itself lags behind, 

tho swift- wing'd arrows of light. 
When I think of my own native land, 

In a moment I seem to be there ; 
But, alas ! recollection at hand 

Soon hurries me back to despair. 

But tho sea fowl is gone to h-r 
Tho beast is laid down in his lair; 
hero is a season <>f ; 

And I .Mil ivi;iir. 

Then-'- in- ivy in \, i y place,

WAS born in the year 1632, in the city 
York, of a good family, though not of 
that country, my father being a foreigner, 
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull 
got a good estate by merchandise, and 
leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at 
York; from whence he had. married my 
mother, whose re la 1 1 named Ilobin- 

son, a very good family in that country, and 
from whom I was called Robinson K reutz- 
naer ; but, by the usual corruption of words 
in Kn^land, we are now called, uiiy, we call 
ourselves, and write our name, ( 'n 
and so my companions always called me. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I had two elder brother*, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to au English regiment 
of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the f i uul was killed 

de near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. \\ .rond brother 

. any more than my hat was become of me. 

:rd son of the family, and not bred to auy tm .cad began, 

to be tilled very early with rambling the who was very ancient, 

i me a competent share of leaniing, as fkr bion ami a country 

free-school generally goes, and d : but J would i..- sat: 

with nothing but going to sea ; ami my inclination to this led me .so strongly 
against the will, i >mmauds, of my fa ! a^.iin-t all Hie entr.- 

and persuasions of my motli -hing 

fatal in that propni-ion of nature, tending din life of misery which was to 

r, a wise and grave ma;:. ..-nt counsel ag.iinst 

wliat he foresaw was my design. He called me one nior is chamber, where 

he was confined ly the i_ TV warmly with me upon this subject: 

he asked me what reasons, more than i <.n<lering inclination, [ had l'-r le.i \im: 

my father's house and my native count 1 might be well introduced, and had a 

prospect of raising my 1 v application and industry, with a life of ease and 

pleasure. He told me i iiaml, or of aspiring, 

superior fortunes 01 ut abroad upon adventui uterprise, 

and mak> Hrefl famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common r- 

these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mim 
the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had 
1 by long Mate in the world, the most suited to human 

exjx)sed to the md hardships, the labour and sufferings of the 

of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and 
'.. upprr part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the hap 

M thing, vi/, that this was the state of life which all other people 
em ied ; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born 

;ent things, ami wished they had been placed in the middle of the two e\t t . 
Iwtween the mean and the great ; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the 

: fi-lieity, when In- prayed to have neither poverty nor riches. 

H'- badr me observe it. ;,nd I should always find, that the calamities of life 

were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; bnt that the middle station 

hid the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or 

rt of mankind not subjected to so many distempers and 

mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and 

"lie hand, <T by hard labour, want of m, i <>r 

hand, bring distempers upon tie 1-v tin- natural 

consequences of tin living; tin' tin- middle station of life was calculated for 

all kind <.f virtues and all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the h uid- 

U <f a middle 1 m|n > rai , moderation, (juii'tn?ss, health, society, all 

agreeable .ugs attending the middle 

' life ; tha' ]i;.'ii went silently and smoothly through the world, and 

My out of it, not embarrassed with the 1 li.-id, not 

d.iily bread, n >r hara-ed with pei-ple\ed eircn 
v-'hi i f)f peace, and the body of rest; nor enraged with the pis, ion of 






envy, or tin- secret burning lu.^t of anibition \'r '! -at t, in ea-\ 

i stances, sliding gently through tin- world, and 
without the Litter ; feeling that they an- happy, and ! 
to know it more sensibly. 

After this he pressed me earnestly, :ind in th,- most all'.rt i-.nate manm-r, not U) 
the young man, nor to precipitate myself into m. . and t),- >tution of 

life F was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I wa-; niid-r : 

ing my bread ; tluit lio would do well for me, and endeavour t. t \iilv 

into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me ; ami that if I was 
not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault i 
hinder it ; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his 
duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a v. 
that as he would do very kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at homo as he 
directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me 
encouragement to go away ; and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an 
example, to whom lie had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him IV 
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him t 
run into the army, where he was killed ; and though he said he would not cease to 
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, 
would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having negh 
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I 
suppose my father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears run 
down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ; 
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was 
so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say 
no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise ? and 
I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my 
father's desire. But, alas ! a few days wore it all off ; and, in short, to prevent any of my 
father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from 
him. However, I did not act quite so hastily neither as the first heat of my resolution 
prompted, but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasunt 
than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the 
world, that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with j 
it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I 
was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to 
an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my time, but I should 
certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; and if she 
would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and 
did not like it, I would go no more, and I would promise, by a double diligence, to 
recover the time that I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me shu knew it would be to no 
purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject ; that he knew too well what was 
my interest to give his consent to anything so much fr my hurt; and that she * 
wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my 
father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me ; 
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me ; but I might ,

bfl sight was, a t, the most til-light t'ul that ever I aw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very cheerful , 
looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and 
1 be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, le>t my good 
resolutions should continue, my companion who 1. i me away comes t<> me. 

"Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder. ' how do you do after it? I 
warrant you were frighted, werVt you, last night, when it blew but a capful of

was made, and I was made half-drunk with it ; and in tlt.it one i.

I made in my d ;nd, indeed, some intervals of reflection ; and the serious 

n it were, endeavour to return again sometimes ; but I shook them off, 
and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drink- 
ing and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, for so I called them ; and I 
had, in five or six days, got as complete a victory over my conscience as any young 
w that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another

1 the weather calm, w,- had made but little way since the storm. 

we were obliged to com'- to an anchor, and hero we lay, the wind continuing 

contrary, viz., at south-west, for wven or eight days, during which time a great many

CRUSOE'S FIRST VOYAGE. 



By this time it blew a tcrril.l.- M..HII indeed ; an<i n<.\- I began to see terr<> 
ama/emcnt in the fares even of the MMIIICII themselves. The master, tin- : t in 

the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and o ' 
could liear him softly to himself B 1 times, " i . us ! we 

be all lost ! we shall be all undone ! " and tlie like. Dm I was 

stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the si. 

my temper. I could ill resume (he lir.a penitemv wli'u-h I had BO apparently trampled 
upon, and hardened myself against : I thought (he bittenMM "f death had ' 
and that tliis would be nothing too, like the first ; hut wh'-n the nia>t-r him>elf can 
me, a~s 1 said just now, and said we should be all lost, I \vas dreadfully frighted. J got 
up out of my cabin, and looked out ; but such a dismal sight I 

mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes. When I could look 
about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two ships that rode m .< und, 

had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship 
which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, being driven 
from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that not 
with a mast standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the 
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only 
their spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them 
cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain pro' 
ing to him that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented ; and when they had 
cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they 
were obliged to cut that away also ; and make a clear deck. 

And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young 
sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little. But if I can express at 
this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of 
mind upon account of my former convictions, and the having returned from them to 
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added 
to the teiTor of the storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by no words describe 
it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the 
teamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, 
but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now and 
then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one respect, that I did not 
know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, ' 
that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more 
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship 
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our 
distresses, one of the men that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung a leak ; 
another said, there was four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the 
pump. At that word, my heart, as 1 thought, died within me ; and I fell backwards 
upon the side of my bed, where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, 
and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as 
another ; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. 
While this was doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out / 
the storm, were obliged to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, 
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, 
thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so :

been dead ; and it was a great while before I came to myself. 

it the water increasing in tin- hold, it was apparent that the ship 

would founder ; :md though the storm began to abate a little, yet a- it was not pos.-il.lo 
she i till we might run into any port, so the master continued tiring guns for 

help ; and a light ship, who ! liead of us, ventured a boat out to help 

us. It was with the utmost hazard the K-at came near us; but it was impossible for us 
to get on board, or for the boat to lie ? >ide, till at last the men ro\ 

aid venturing their lives to KI ur men cast them a rope over the

labour and hazard, took hold of, ai. 1- d them close under our stern, and got all 

their boat. It was to i it, to 

think of reaching to their own shiji ; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her 

in towards shore as much as we could ; and our mast. d them, that it' the l>oat 

was stav.d u|>n d) uld make it good to their master: so partly rowing, and 

part! \ to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost 

ton Ness. 

iiu-li more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her 
sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in 
the sea. I mu>t acknowledge I had hardly ryes to look up when tin- .seamen told me 
she was sinking; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat, than that 
I might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, 

h horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

this fur a plain and visible token that y>u aiv not to be a seafaring man." " Why, sir," 
said I, "will you go to sea no more?" "That is moth .-aid lie; "it is my

went on board a venae) l><>und to the mast of \ 
it, a voyage to Cuin.-a.* 

It -was my great misfortune dm in all at a 

sailor; when, though I might inde.-d have work.-d a litth- ham 
the same time I should ha\v learnt tin- duty and olli.-c ,,f a f,, r . 

might have qualified myself for a mate ,, r lieutenant, it' .18 it 

was always my fate to choose for the w..r.st, BO I did h- 
pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always L" 
gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship nor learnt t 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London, \vlij.-h does 
not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then was ; the de\ il 
generally not omitting to lay some snare for them very early ; but it was not so with 
me. I first got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coa 
Guinea ; and who, having had very good success there, wa 1 to go again ; this 

captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that 
time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage 
with him, I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his companion ; 
and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it tha- 
trade would admit ; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendship with this captain, who 
was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a small 
adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captar 
increased very considerably; for I carried about 40 in such toys and trifles as tin- 
captain directed me to buy. This 40 I had mustered together by the assistance of 
some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or 
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my adventure-. 
which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom ;, 
got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how 
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in .short, to under- 
stand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for, as he took delight 
to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a 
sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my 
adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost 300 ; and this filled me 
with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I wa- 
tinually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the clim 
our principal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north, 
even to the line itself. 

I was now set up 'for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great mi-foi -turn', 
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and I embark, d in 
the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the 
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for 
though I did not carry quite 100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had .fiMio left 
which I had lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet 1 fell into 

* Guinea. A district of .that part of the West Coast of Africa where the laml runs nearly due 
west. The six countries into which it is divided are known to sailors under the names of Sierra Leone, 
Urain Coast, Ivory Coast, Gold Qoast, Slave Coast, and Benin.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended ; i 
carried up the country to the Emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but 
"was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made 
being young and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising change of 
my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly 
whelmed ; and now I looked back upon my father's prophetie discourse to me, 
that I should be miserable and have none to relieve me; which I thought 



now so effectually brought to p:tss, that I could not be worse; for now t In- 
hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption. But ( 
alas ! this was but a ta.*te of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in 
the sequel of this story. 

As rny ne\v patron or master, had taken me home to his house. BO I wa> in 
hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea .i-ain. l.elievin- 
that it would some timo or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portu- 
guese man-of-war; and that then I should beset at liberty. Hut this hope of 
mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he le't m <>n shore to 
look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slav-> about his 
house; and when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered .'ne to lie in 
the cabin to look after the ship.

ROI Rl'SOE. 



1 meditated n. .tiling but my escape, aiul what method I might take to 
effect ir ; but found no \ V ;iy that had the least probability in it ; nothing presented 
to make the supposition of it rational ; for I had nobody to communicate it to that would 
embark with me ; n.i f-llow -sl.ive, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but 
myself; so that tor two years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination. 
I never had the l.a>t . ncouraging prospect of putting it in practice. 

i- about r . an odd circumstance ) ; :self, which put the old 

thought of making s >me attempt for my liberty again in my head. My patr<n lying at 
home linger than u>u.d without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of 
money, he used, constantly, once i.r twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather wa> 
to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing ; and as he always 
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we made him very m Try, and 
T pioved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me 
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth the Moresco, as they callei him. to 

. a dish of fish for him. 

It happened onu time, that going a-fishing with him in a calm morning, 
i'-k, that though we were not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and 

ng we knew not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next night ; 
and when the morning ca*ne, we found we had pulled out to sea instead of pul'.ug in for 
th- shon? ; aiid that we were at least two leagues from the land. However, we got 
well in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some danger ; for the wind 
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of himself 
for the future ; and having lying by him the lo\g-boat of our English ship which he 
had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a compass and 
some provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English 
slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like 
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main- 
sheet ; and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed 
with what wo call a shoulder-of mutton sail ; and the boom jibbed over the top of 
the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a 
wo, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some bott].-> 
of such liquor as he thought fit to drink ; and particularly his bread, rice, and cotl'ee. 

\V, w.-nt frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most dexterous 
to catch fish for him, !. vent without me. Jt happened that he had ap- 

pointed to go out in this boat, ritlier for pleasure or for fish, with two or three 

r.s of some dUt in-'t ion in that place, and for whom he had provided extraordi- 
narily, and had thetrfore smt on board the boat over-night a larger store of pro 

>ni than usual : and had onl.-r.'d me to get ready three fusils* with powdn- 
and shot, uhirh \\rn- on board his .ship, for that they designed some spoi t of fowling 

11 MS fishing.

This moment, my former n .,- now 

I found I was likely to have a little 
gone, I prepared to furnish myself, no! 
I knew not, neither did I so much a 
to get out of that place was my desire. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to get some- 

thing for our subsistence on board ; for 1 told him we mu-t n..t pi- 
patron's bread, Jle said, that was true ; so hi; brought a lar^'e bi4:. t .,f ink m i-iscuil 
of their kind, and three jars with fresh watei-, into tin- boat. 1 kne-.v wh- 
case of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, v o f Home 

English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was ou hi. 
as if they had been there before for our master. 1 convf. 
wax into the boat, which weighed about half an hundredweight) with a j 
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which wen- of u r i 

wards, especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried uj> >n liim, which 
he innocently came into also : his name was Ismael, which they call Mi;l- .. or M 
so I called to him : "Moely," said I, "our patron's guns are all on board 
can you not get a little powder and shot 1 It may be we may kill ><>.ne alcamies (a 
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner'.-, the 

ship." " Yes," says he, " I'll bring some :" accordingly, he broii- ich, 

which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more ; an i with 

shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the i 
the same time, I had found some powder of my master's in tin ;n, with v. 

I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pom 
was in it into another; and thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of 
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who 
and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port i 
hauled in our sail, and sat us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.I'!., \\hidi 
was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made 
the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz ; but my resoluti 
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place wh 
leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when I had lish mi my hook 
I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said to tl. will 

not do; our master will not be thus served ; we must stand farther oil'." Il<.'!iink 
ing no harm, agreed, and, being in the head of the boat, set the sail- ; and. as I ha 1 
the helm, I ran the boat out near a league farther, and then brought her to a> if 1 
would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, 1 stepped forward to where the M 
and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise with my 
arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into tin; >ea. 11.- POM im- 
mediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, h.-g-rd to b taken in, telling me 
he would go all over the world with me. lie swam after the bo.it, that h-- 

would have reached me very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which I Mrpped 
into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, 1 [.resented it at him, and 
him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be .pik-i 1 would d.. him none : lint/' 
said J, "you swim well enough to reach the shore, and the im j make the

best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm ; hut it' you come near the 

boat, I'll shoot you through the head. t',.r I am resolved to have my liberty." So he 
turned himself alnmt, and swam for the slum-, and 1 make mi doubt lut he reached it 
with vast', for he was an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken th: i:h me, and have drowned the 

boy, I. nt there was no venturing' him. When he wua gone, I turned to tl.e 

boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, M .Xury. it' y..u will be faithful to me, I'll 
m. ike you a great man ; hut it* you will not stroke yur face to be true to me." that 

ve.ir by Mahomet and h heard, -I must throw you into the sea t 

The hoy smiled in my fare, and spoke so innocently, that I could nor mistrust him and 

rhful to me, ami # all over tlie world with me. 

While I was in the view of the Moor that was swimming I stood out directly 
to sea, with the boat rather stretching to windward, that they might think me _ 
towards the Straits'* mouth (as indeed any one that had l.een in their wits m 
have hem supposed to ,1,,) : f,, r who would have supposed we were sailing on to the 
southward to the truly harbariai , here whole nation., of ftegT sure 

:iToiu.d us with th. we could never once go on 

lui we should he devoured hy savage beasts, or more mercih : vs of 

human kind ( 

as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and steered 
ly .Nouth and by east, bending my course a little towards the east, that I might 
keep in with the shore : and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, 
I made such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when 
I first made the land, I could not be less th in one hundred and fifty miles south of 
Sallee : quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king 
thereabouts, for we saw no people. 

ii'-h was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful a;. prehensions 

1 had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an 

bh wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner live days ; and then, 

the wind shifting to the southward, I eoneluded also that if any of our reOBelfl \\-re in 

chase of me, they also would now ifiv over ; 10 1 \entured to make to the coa-t, and 

to an anchor in the month of a 1, I knew not, what nor where ; neither 

what latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I neither Hkw, nor desired 

e any |>eople ; the principal thing I wanted was fV,.,h water. We came into 
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and 

ver the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful 

s of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not 
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and Ue^ed of me not to go 

hore till day. " W-ll, Xnry," said I, "then 1 won't; but it DM may,

still all niuht; I say still, for we >lept none : for in two or three hours we

Xurv was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; hut we were both

we could not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a m<>n~- 
and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so fr .m-lit I kn-.w ;

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



A-ould, we were obliged to go 'ii sh.iv somewhere or other lor water, 

I not a pim left in the l>.at ; when or where to get it was the point. Xury 

said, if 1 \voiilil k't liiui go on shore with on,- of tin- jars, ho would liud if then- was any

of our patron's ease of bottles which 1 mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat in as 
near the shore as we thought was proper, and waded on shore, carrying nothing but 
our arms, and two jar.- for w. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coining of canoes with 
savages down the river ; but the boy, seeing a low place about a mile up the country, 
rambled to it, and by-and-by 1 saw him come running towards me. 1 thought he was 
v >ome savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards 
him to help him; but when I came nearer to him. I saw something hanging over his 
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in col 
and | jsj however, we were very glad of it, and it wa- very good meat ; but the 

great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good water, ami 
no wild in 

.wards that we need not take such pains for water, for a little 

higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide was out, 
which flows but a little way up; so we tilled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had 
killed, and prepared to go oil our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature 
in that part of the country. 

one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that the islands of 

the < :i 1 the Cape de Verd Islands also, lay not far off from the coast. P.ut as 

I had no inst: , take an LOD to know what latitude we were in, and 

diil not exactly know, or at least not remember, what latitude they were in, 1 knew not 

u: to look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them ; otherwise I might 

now easily have found some of thoe islands. Hut my hope wa N that if I stood along

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I had pursued tlii.s resolution alxmt ten days longer, as I have said, I began 
to EC- hind was inhabited ; and in two or three places, as wo .-ailed by, we saw 

> stand upon the shore to look ild also perceive they were quite Mack, 

stark naked I wa lined to have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was 

my better counsellor, and said to me, "No go, no go." However, I hauled in near, r 
the shi.iv talk to tin in, and I found they ran along the shore by me a 

good way : I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long 
;<-k, which Xury said was a lance, and that they could throw them a great 
way with good aim : so I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I 
1 , and particularly made signs for something to eat : they beckoned to me to stop 
my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, 
1 two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour 
came back, and brought with them two pieces of diy flesh and some corn, such as is the 
produce of their country ; but we neither knew what the one or the other was : how- 
were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for I 
would not venture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us : but they 
took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the .shore and laid it down, and v. 
and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. 
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends; but 
: portunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully : for while we were 
_: on the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) 
with great fury from the mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male pur- 
; the friu. ile, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more 
than we could tell whether it was usual or strange : but I believe it was the latter; 
because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night ; 
in the second place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially the women. 
man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did ; how. 

creatures ran directly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon any of 
the negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come 
ion : at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I 
' I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible expe- 
dition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my 
, I fired, and .-hot him directly in the head : immediately he sank down into the 
!-, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life, and 
be immediately made to the shore; but between the wound, which 
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the 
shore.

go on with, 1 might as well have stayed at home, and never fatigued

In this manner 1 used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret. 1 had

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



upon our own coasts, with design to stretch over lot tin- African coast, when they came 
into alxnit ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude ; which, it s>eems, was the manner 
of their coun-e in those days. We h ; ,d vety good weather, onK ely hot, nil tlie 

\\ay ii{M.n OKI- own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; from 
whe rt her off at Be i. kt of land, and steered as if we were 

bound for the isle rYrnando de Noronha, holding our course N.K. lv X., and leav- 
ing | on the east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve days 
time, and were, by our la>t observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minute-; 
nortlnTii latitude, \\hen a \iolent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our 
knowledge. It began from the bouth-east, came about to the north-west, and then 
d into the north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for 
t \vel\e days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding awav before it, 
let it carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and during ti 
twel 1 need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor 
did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this dUtrett W6 had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men die I of 
the calenture, and a man and a boy washed overboard. About the twellth day, 
the weather abating a little, the master made an observation as well as he could, and 
found that he was in about eleven degrees of north latitude, but that he was twenty-two 
if longitude difference west from Cape St Augustino ; so that he found he was 
gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river A ma/ones, 
towards that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great River ; and now he began 
to consult with me what course he should take ; for the ship was leaky, and very much 
disabled, and he was for going directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively again>t that; and looking over the charts of the sea-coast of 
America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have 
recourse to till we came within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore resolved 
to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the in-draft of the 
bay or gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, iu about fifteen days sail ; 
whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some 
assistance both to our ship and to < 

With this design \s e changed our course, and steered away N.W. by "NV., in order to 
reach some of our Knglish islands, where I hoped for relief ; but our voyage was other- 
d-tei mined ; for, being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a 
second storm came upon us, which eairied us away with the same impetuositv westward, 
and drove US SO out of the way of all human com me i ce, that had all our lives been saved 
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than ever 
returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early one 
morning cried out, ' Land '. ' and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, iji 
hoj.es of seeing whereabouts in the world ^ 'nip struck upon a sand, 

and in a moment, her motion being so stopj>ed, the MM broke over her in such a 
manner, that we expected we should all have pen-lied immediately ; and we 

driven into our close Barter*, to shelter us from the very foam and spray 
of the sea, 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to describe 
or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We knew nothing wlu're 
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven ; whether an island or the main,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



hanging down by tin- fun-chains so low, (1. ivat ditlieulty 1 got hold of it, and 

by the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of tin- ship. Here 1 found that the 
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of wain- in her hold; but thai .she lay so on the 
of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her Mem lay lifted up upon the hank, 
and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter wa* free, and all 
that was in that part was dry ; for you may be sure my first work v. : vh, and to 

see what was spoiled and what was free. And, first) I found that all the ship's provisions 
were dry and untoiu-hed by the water, and being very well dvpowd to eat, I went to 
the bread-room, and Tilled my pocket* with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other 
thing*, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which 
I took a large dram, and which 1 had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what 

re me. Now 1 wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things 
which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this extremity 
roused my application. We h.id several spare yards, and two or three large spars 
of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in tin- .ship : I resolved to fall to work with these, 
and I flung as many of them overboard as 1 could manage for their weight, tying every 
one with a rope, that they might not drhe away. When this was done, 1 went down 
the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both ends, as 
well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon 

:i, crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not abl 
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light So I went to work, and with 
the caq>enter's saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my 
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with 
necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have beeii able to have done 
upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next care waa 
what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the 
but I was not long considering this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I 
could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, 1 iirst got three of the 
Beam , which I had broken .p,-n and emptied, and lowered them down upon 

my raft; the first of these I filled with provisions vi/., bread, rice, three Dutch che< 

of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of 
j>ean corn, which had been laid by f..r s.>me f..\\l> which we brought to sea with us, 
but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to 
my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. 
As for liquors, I found several cases of botti > our skipper, in which v 

some cordial waters ; and, in all, about live or six gallons of arrack. These I stowed by 
themselves, there being no need to put them into nor any room forth 

While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, tl J e.ilni : and 1 had 

the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had 1. It mi 
upon the sand, swim away. As for my 1 only linen, and op 

'1, I swam on board in them and my stockings. However, thi> put me upon 

rummaging for clothes, of which I found en t took no more than I wanted for 

' 'i- I had other things whi. h my eye was more upon; : ..ils 

to work with on sh'.re : and it ,:ng that I found out the

was portable and fit to hand out, I began with ti. ng the gr- into 

pieces such as I could move, I got two cable and a hawser on slum-, with all the i: 
work I could get; and having cut down r .iil-yurd, and tin- ini/.-n yard. 

everything I could to make a lar^e raft, I l.,ad-d it with all those heavy goodl 
came away; but my good luck began to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy, 
and so overladen, that after I was entered the little cove, when- I had landed tin- rest 
of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the- other, : m-l 

threw me and all my cargo into the water ; as for my><-lf, it was n- 
was near the shore ; but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially 
iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me ; however, when the tide 
was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infi- 
nite labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued IM ,. 
much. After this, I went every day on board, and brought away what I could get. 

I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on board the 
ship, in which time I had brought away .all that one pair of hands could well be sup- 
posed capable of bringing ; though I verily believe, had the calm weather held, I should 
have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece ; but preparing the twelfth time to go 
on board, I found the wind began to rise : however, at low water I went on board, and 
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be 
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or 
three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and 
forks ; in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money some European coin, 
some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " Oh, drug ! " said I aloud, " what art 
thou good for ? Thou art not worth to me no, not the taking off the ground ; one of 
those knives is worth all this heap ; I have no manner of use for thee; e'en remain 
where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is not worth saving." 
However, upon second thoughts, I took it away ; and wrapping all in a piece of canvas, 
I began to think of making another raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the 
sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh 
gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to 
make a raft with the wind off shore ; and that it was my business to be gone before 
the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all. 
Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the channel which lay 
between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the 
weight of the things I had about me, and partly from the roughness of the water ; for 
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth about me 
veiy secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I looked out, 
behold, no more ship was to be seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with 
this satisfactory reflection, that I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get 
everything out of her that could be useful to me ; and that, indeed, there was little left 
in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her, except 
what might drive on shore from her wreck ; as, indeed, divers pieces of her at tor wards 
did ; but those things were of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either savages, 
if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island ; and I had many thoughts 



VV ft 







of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make whether I should 
make me a cave in tho earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in sh '.ved np>n 

both; the manner and ti .>!' \\ hu-h it may n < JUT to give an account of. 

I soon fouud the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, particularly I- 
it was upon a low moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would not be V 
some, and more particularly because there v. near it; so I resolved to 

find a more healthy and more conv.-ui.-nt .-pot of ground. 

iisulted several things in my situation, which I found would bo proper for me . 

first, health and fn I just now mentioned ; .secondly, shelter from the heat of 

..iiriiy from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast; fourthly, a 

riew to the sea, that if God sent any .ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for 

my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish m 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the >ide of a rising hill, 
whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house side, so that nothing could 
come down upon me from the top. On the side of the rock there was a hollow place, 
worn a lr in, like the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really any 

cave, or way into the rock, at all. 

Un i i below this hollow place, I resolved to pitch my 

< a hundred yard, broad, and about twice as long, and lay like 
my door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly every way .1 
the low ground by the B-side. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill ; so that it 
w* 3 shell' v day, till it came to the W. and by S. sun, or there- 

abouts, which, in tho.se counti >r the setting. 

re I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow place, which took in 
about ten yards in its semi -diameter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter 

Ing and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the ground 
till they .-,tood very firm like pile-, the biggest end being out of the ground above live 
md a half, and sharpened on the t>p. The t iid not stand above six inches 

from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which 1 had cut in the ship, and laid them in 
upon one another, within tin- circle, between these two rows of stakes, up to the t .p. 
:rg other stakes in the in.-id", leaning ;.. m, about two feet and a half high 

hk.- ,-i spur to a post; and thi.s fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could 
into it or over it. This cost me a great <l.-.il ,,f time and UbotJ ly to cut 

i the woods, bring th.-m to the place, and drive them int.. the earth..

I apprehend. -d danger from. 

, or fortress, with infinite labou: ' .':! my ri--hes, all my 

, ammunition, and stores, of which ; and I 

made me a large tent also, to : me from i 

arc ^ a there. I made it double viz., one smaller tent within, and one larger 

above it ; and covered the uppermost part of it with I ^lu'in, which I had 

I among the sails. 



40 




And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which I had brought on shore, but 
in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would spoil by the 
wet ; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now 
I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing all the 
earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in 
the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half; and 
thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my 
house. 

It cost me much labour and many days before all these things were brought to 
perfection ; and therefore I must go back to some other things which took up some 
of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the 
setting up the tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, 
dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that, a great c ip of 
thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the 
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning 
itself, " Oh, my powder ! " My very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one 

41 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on which Dot my defence only, but the 
providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious 
about my own danger; though, had the powder took lav, I had never known who had 
hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that, after the storm was over, 1 laid aside 
all my work, inv building and fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes 
to separate my powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hopes, 
that whatever might come, it might not all take firo at once ; and to keep it so apart, 
that it should not be possible to make one part firo another. I finished this work, 
in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, which in all was about one hundred and 
forty pounds weight, was divided into no less than a hundred parcels. As to tho barrel 
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that; so I placed it iu my 
new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in 
li<'K-.s among the rocks, so that no wet might conic to it, marking very carefully where 
I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least once every 
day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to sec if I could kill anything fit for 
food ; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced. 
The first time I went out, I presently discovered that there were goats in the island, 
which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune 
to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most 
difficult thing in the world to come at them ; but I was not discouraged at this, not 
doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after I had 
found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they 
saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away, a.s in a 

"le fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they 
took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that by the position of their optics, 

r sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily see objects that were 
above them; so after wards I took this method I always climbed the rocks first, to 
get above them, and then hud frequently a fair mark. 

The fn-t shot I made among these creature-!, I killed a she-goat, which had a little 
kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily ; for, when the old ono 
fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and not only so, but 
whet i the old one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to 

lire; upon which, I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and 
carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would n-t eal ; so I 
was forced to kill it and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great 
while, for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread especially, as much as 
I possibly could. 

II -ing now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary t provide a place 
to make a fire in, and fuel to burn ; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my 
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place ; but I 
must now give some little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it 
may w,-ll bo supposed, wero not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition, for I I ffi ; ' ' away upon that island 
without be ing driven, as is said, by a violent htonn quite out of the course of our 
intended voyage, and a great way, vix., some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary 
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of 

4- | 

d&BMHttftttb***' r i TT^iV iTiiPiiiT f 1r\ 



OE'S CALKNDAK. 



Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in tliis desolate manner, I should md my life. 
The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made tin-,- refleotlOlil ; un<l n 
times I would expostulate with myself why Providence should thus completely ruin its 
creatures, and render them so absolutelv miserable, so without help abandoned, and so 
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be. rational to 1> thankful for su.-h a- lit'.-. 

But something always returned swift upon me t > check the>e til-nights, and to 
reprove me; and particularly one day walking with my gun in my hand by the sea- 
side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when Reason, us it 
were, put in expostulating with me the other way, thus : "Well, you are in a desolate 
condition, it is true ; but, pray remember, where are the rest of you ? Did not you < 
eleven of you into the boat ? Where are the ten ? Why were not they saved, and you 
lost ? Why are you singled out ? Is it better to be here or there ? " And then I 
pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in them and 
with what worse attended them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my subsistence, and 
what would have been my case if it had not happened (which was a hundred thousand 
to one) that the ship floated from the place where first she struck, and was driven so 
near to the shore, that I had time to get all these things out of her ? What would have 
been my case, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at first 
came on shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to supply and procure them ? 
" Particularly," said I aloud (though to myself), " what should I have done without a 
gun, without ammunition, without any tools to make anything, or to work with ? with- 
out clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of coverings ? " and that now I had all these 
to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to 
live without my gun, when my ammunition was spent : so that I had a tolerable view 
of subsisting without any want as long as I lived ; for I considered from the beginning 
how I would provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time that was to 
come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after my health 
and strength should decay. 

I confess I had not then entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyed 
at one blast I mean, my powder being blown up by lightning ; and this made the 
thoughts of it surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just 
now. 

And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life, such, 
perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its beginning, 
and continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, when, in 
the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun being 
to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head : for I reckoned myself, 
by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of 
the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my thoughts that I 
should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen, and ink, and should even 
forget the Sabbath-day from the working-days ; but to prevent this, I cut it with my 
knife upon a large post, in capital letters ; and making it into a great cross, I set it up 
on the shore where I first landed, viz., " I came on shore here on the 30th of Sep- 
tember, 1650." 

Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my knife, and every 
seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long 
<*=rr=~^ 43 ^-sSS^afc* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



again as that long one ; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly 
reckoning of time. 

In th.' next place, we are to observe, that among the many things which I brought 
from the ship in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got 
several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting 
down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the captain's. 
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compasses, some mathematical 
instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation ; all which I huddled 
together, whether I might want them or no : also I found three very good Bibles, 
which came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my 
things; some Portuguese books also; and, among them, two or three Popish prayer- 
books, and several other books; all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget 
that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I must have occa- 
sion to say something in its place, for I earned both the cats with me ; and as for the 
dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I 
went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years ; I wanted 
hat he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me ; I only 
wanted to have him talk to me. but that he could not do. As I observed before, I found 
pens, ink, and paper, and 1 hu-banded them to the utmost ; and I shall show that while 
my ink lasted, I kept things very exact ; but after that was gone I could not, for I could 
not muke any ink by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all that I had 
amassed together ; and of these, ink was one : as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to 
dig or remove the earth ; needles, pins, and thread : as for linen, I soon learned to want 

without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily ; and it was near a whole 
year before I had entirely finished my liitle pale, or surrounded habitation. The 

or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and 

iriiis; in the woods, and more, by far, in bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes 
two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driving it 
into the ground; f<>r \vhi--h purpose, I got a h< of wood at first, but at last 

bethought myself of one of the iron crows; whieh, however, though I found it, yet made 
driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. I'.ut what need I have 
been concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to 
do it in ! nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at least that L could 
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or less, e\ 
day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I was rodu . d 
to ; and I drew up the state of in D writing, not so much to le ive them to any 

were to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my 
ing upon them, and afflicting my mind : and as my reason began 

now to master my despondency, I began to comfoi' myself as well as I could, and to set 
the good against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case from worse, 
and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comfort J enjoyed, against 
the miseries I suffered, thus : 

GOOD.

But God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the 
shore, that I hare got out no many necessary things aa will 
either supply my wants or enable me to supply myself, even 
as long as 1 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce any con- 
dition in the world so miserable, but there was something negative, or something posit 
to be thankful for in it : and let this stand as a din-' 

most miserable of n -ns in this world that wo may always find in it soineti 

to comfort ourselves from, and to set, iu the description of good and evil, on the credit 
side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and giving over looking 
out to ea, to see if I could spy a ship ; I say, giv these things, I began to apply 

myself to accommodate my way of living, and to moke things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side of a 
surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables ; but I might now rather call it a 
wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thiek on the out- 
side : and after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, 
leaning to the rock, and thatched or coveredit with boughs of trees, andsueh things as I 
iet to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and int 
cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that at first this was a 
confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; 
I bad no room to turn myself: so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and worked farther 

the earth; for it was a loose, sandy rock, \\hi--h yielded easily to the labour L 
bestowed on it : and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked 
sideways, to the right hand, into the rock ; and then turning to the i i-lu a^iin, w.,< 
quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortiti. Mtimi. 

gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to 
my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I found I most 
wanted, particularly a chair and a tabl these I was not able to enjoy the 

few comforts I had in the world ; I could not write, or eat, or do several things wit it 
so much pleasure without a t.i 

So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe that as reason is the substance 

and original of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, 

ly making the most rational judgment of things I > may be, in time, 

master of every mechanic art. I had never i tool in my i yet, 

in time, Uy hiUiur, applic r i md, at last, that I wanted 

.ing but I could have made it, especially if I had had took However, I made 
abundance of things, even without tools; and some with n more tools than an 

46 



us jor : 



and a hatchet, which, perhaps, wnv never made that way before, and that with in'. 
labour. For example, if I want.-.', a board, I lj;i,l no oth-T W*J hd to '"it doWU a I 
set it en an edge li.-f., iv me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought 
it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my ad/.e. It i this 

method 1 could make but one board nut of a whole I h i 1 i: . i 

but patience, any more than I had for the pro ligious deal of time and labour which it 
took me up to make a plank <>r board : but my time or labour was little worth, and so 
it was as well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the first place; 
and this 1 did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft from Un- 
ship. But when I had wrought out some boards as above, I made large shelves, of the 
breadth of a foot and an half, one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all 
my tools, nails, and iron-work on; and, in a word, to separate, everything at large into 
their places, that I might come easily at them : also I knocked pieces into the wall of the 
rock, to hang my guns and all things that would hang up : so that had my cave bee 
be seen, it looked like a g. 'neral maga/ine of all necessary things ; and I had everything 
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, 
and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every day's employment ; for. 
indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only an hurry as to labour, but in too 
much discomposure of mind ; and my journal would have been full of many dull things : 
for example, I must have said thus : "Sept. the 3Qtk. After I had got to shore, and had 
escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having lir>t 
vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and 
recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my 
head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out I was undone, undone ! till, 
iiied and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep, 
for fear of being devoured." 

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and had got all I 
could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and 
looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship : then fancy at a vast distance I spied 
a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then, after looking steadily, till I was 
almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase my 
misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled my house- 
hold stuff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me 
as I could, I began I say to keep my journal; of which I shall here give you the copy 
(though in it will be told all these particulars over again), as long as it lasted ; for at 
last, having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off. 

THE JOURNAL. 

September 30, 1659. T, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during 
a dreadful storm, in the oiling, came on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which 
I called "The Island of Despair ;" all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, 
and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances I was 
brought to ; viz., I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in 
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before mi- : either that I should be devoured

by wild bouts, murdered by savageM, or starved to death fur want of food At the 
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creature* ; but slept soundly, though 
it rained all night 

Orfoorr 1. -In the morning I saw, to my grv.it urproe, the ship had floated with 
the high tide, and wa driven on shore again, much nearer the Wan 1 ; %v -hi. -h, ns it was 
some comfort, on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, 
if the wiud abated, 1 might get on hoard, and get some i ..cctoaries out 

for my relief^ so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, 
who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, 
that they would not have been all drowned, as they wcr. u been 

saved, we might perhaps have built tu a b.- of the sin;.. t<> h .v 

earned as to sane other part of the world. I spent great port of t 
Myself on these things ; but, at length, seeing the ship almost Uo sand 

a near as I could, and then swam on board. This day also it t hough 

with no wind at all. 

From t& 1st o/ Oetooer to tk : Ml these days emir 

voyages to grt all I could out of the ship, which I brought on >h- f flood, 

upon rafts. Much rain also, in these days, the >:u<- int.-naN of fair wea

The working part of tliis day and the next were wholly employed in making this 
table, lor f was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a 
complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any one else. 

This day I went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a wild 
cat; h-r skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature 1 killed, 
I t.,.ik oil' the skins and preserved them. Coming l>a<-k by the sea-slum-. I 
niuiv sorts of sea-fo\vls, which I did not understand ; but was surprised, and ji! 
frighted, with two or three seals, which, while I was gu/.ing at, not well kn 
what they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with my table again, and 
finished it, though not to my liking ; DOT was it long before I learned to mend it. 

-Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th. xh, !'ih, loth, and 
pan of the li'th (for the llth was Sunday according to my reckoning), I to,,k 
wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable > 
but never to please me; and even in the making 1 pulled it to pieces several tn 
Note. I soon neglected keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark forth. 

Forgot which was which. 

!.'>. This day it rained, which refreshed n ugly, and o..lei] the 

earth ; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me 

49 









dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I i "iy 

stock '* many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

: .These three days I spent in making little square chests, or b 

which might 1 -r two pounds at most, of powder : and so, putting

,o three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not 

t.i mil it. 

I began t- ind my tent into the rock, to make room tor 

_ Throo t .is work ; vi/,, a pickaxe, a shovel, 

nd :i -row, or basket; so I desi my work, and began to consider how 

toroppK -. and make me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I made use of the

I was still detiei.-nt. !* 1 \\anted a basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket I could

than about twenty-tour yards in length, being a half-circle, from OE the rock 

to another place, about eight yards from it, the door of the eave being in the centre 
behind it.

I got <.vcr my wall for frar of the M!!, which 

upon iiir. I was no sooner -tepped <lown upon th- ;'. :.ly saw it 

rible earth-puke : for tin- ground I stood on shook three times at about eight 
minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest 
building that could In- supposed to have stood upon the earth : and a great pi--.--- oi 
top of the r-'ck, which stood about half a mile from me. : ,vhh 

su-h a terril)le noise as I never heard in all my life. I per. 

i-ut into a violent, motion l>y it ; and I believe the -hoek< .:id-r the 

;han on the island. 

I \vas so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt tl, 
coursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupefied ; and the m< 
of the earth made my stomach sick like one that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of 
falling of the rock awaked me as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition 
I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling 
upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once ; and this sunk my 
very soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began to take 
courage ; and yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of 1 
buried alive, but still sat upon the ground, greatly cast down and di-< 
knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the least serious religion - 
nothing but the common "Lord, have mercy upon me!" and when it 
went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it grew cloudy, as if it would rain : 
soon after that, the wind arose by little and little, so that in less than half an hour it 
blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind : the sea was, all on a sudden, covered with 
foam and froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of the water ; the trees were 
torn up by the roots ; arid a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and 
then began to abate ; and then in two hours more it was calm, and began to rain very 
hard. All this while I sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected ; \\ 
on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequences 
of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into 
my cave again. With this thought, my spirits began to revive ; and the rain 
helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent; but the rain w:, 
violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it ; and I was \\ 
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. 
This violent rain forced me to a new work, \ i/.., to cut a hole through my new f.-,:tiii- 
cations, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would el>e hive drowned my 
cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and found still no a ks of the 

i<piake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to support my spirits, 
which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a sm;ill sup of 
rum ; which, however, I did then and always very sparingly, know i have no

7* When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely rei no ved. The forecastle^ 
which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, 
which was broken to pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea soon 
after I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side ; 
and the sand was thrown so high on that side next the stern, that whereas there 
was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a 
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her when the 
tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done 
by the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was more broken open than 
formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and 
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habitation, 
and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching whether I could 
make any way into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, 
for that all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had 
learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I 
could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be of 
some use or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which I 
thought held some of the upper part or quarter deck together, and when I had cut 

57 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest; 
but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time. 

4. I went u-lishing, but caught not one tish that I durst eat of, till I was 

weary of my sport; when, just going to leave ofl', I caught a young dolphin. 1 had 

> me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet 1 frequently caught 

fish enough, as much as I cared to cut ; all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry. 

". Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought three great 

fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on shore when 

the tide of flood came on. 

May G. Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out of her, and other pieces 
of iron-work ; worked very hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts of 
giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, with an intent not to work, but found the 
weight of the wreck had broken itself down, the beams being cut ; that several pieces of 
the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into 
it ; but it was almost full of water and siiid. 

M'li/ s. 'Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the deck 
which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and 
brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next 
day. 

9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of the 
k, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could not break 
them up. I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to 
move. 

May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the wreck; and got a great deal of 
pieces of timber, and boards, or planks, and two or three hundredweight of iron. 

May 15. I earned two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off the roll of 
by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as it 
about a foot and a half in the water, 1 could not make any blow to drive the

It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more broken by 
the force of th Iml I .-tayed so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that

-V'/// 17. I saw sonic pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great distance, near 
two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and found they were pieces of 
the head, but too heavy for me to bring away. 

i y day, to this day, I worked on the wreck ; and with hard labour I 
loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide several > 
floated out, and two of the seamen's chests; but the- wind blowing from the .shun- 
nothing came to land that day but pioces o? timber, and a hn^hrad, which had some 
JJraxil pork in it; but the saltwater and the sand had spoiled it I continued this 
work every day to the 15th of June, exce]t the time necessary to get food, which I 
always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that 
I might be ready when it was ebbed oufc; and by this time I had gotten timber, and plank, 
si d iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if 1 had known how ; and also I got,

J/'it'- 1 . 20. Xo rest all night; violent pains in my head, and fev<-rMi. 

June 21. Very ill ; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of my sad 
condition to be sick, and no help : prayed to God, for the first time since the storm, 
off of Hull, but scarce knew what I said or why ; my thoughts bring all confu 

Jn.ite '2'2. A little better; but under dreadful apprehrn-ions of sick 

June 23. Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent heada< h<-. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent : the fit held me seven hours ; cold fit, and hot 
with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found myse'f 
very weak; however, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and 
broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but h.-id 
no pot. 

Jmif 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and neither ate nor 
drank. I was ready to perish for thirst ; but so weak I had no strength to stand up, 
or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed ; and 
when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say ; only I lay and cried, 
" Lord, look upon me ! Lord pity me ! Lord have mercy upon me ! " I suppose I did 
nothing else for two or three hours ; till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not awake 
till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and 
exceeding thirsty ; however, as I had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie 
till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had this terrible dream : 
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when 
the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black 
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground : he was all over as bright as 
a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him : his countenance was most 
inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe ; when he stepped upon the ground 
with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, 
and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of lire. 
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forwards towards me, with a long 
spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at - 
distance, he spoke to me or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to exj 
the terror of it. All that I can say I understood wai this : "Seeing all these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, now thoti shalt die ;" at which words, I thought 
lie lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me. 

Xo one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be able to describe 
the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, 
I even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible to describe the impression 
that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 






I had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the good instruction of 

father was then worn out by an w: ted series, for eight years, of seafaring 

wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but such as were, like myself; wicked 
and profane to the last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one 
thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards 
towards a reflection upon my own ways; butacertai y of soul, without desire 

of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that th.- 
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common sailors can be supj>osed to 
be not having the least sense, either of the fear of God in dangers, or of thankfulness 
to God in deliverances, 

he relating what is already past of my story, thi< will I* th- more easily believed 
when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that 1. , 1 to this day befall, n 
me, I never had so much as one thought of its being the hand of God, or that it was a 
just punishment for my sins my rebellious behaviour aguii. my father or my 
present sins, which were great or so much as a punishment for the general course of 
my fa. When I was on the desperate expedition ,>n the desert shores of 

Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would become of me, or one 
to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the danger win. h 
apparently surrounded me, as w- .<*racious creatures as cruel savages; 1 

was merely thoughtless of God or a Providence I acted like a mere brute, from th, 
iples of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly that 
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt 
justly Mid honourably with, as well as charitably, 1 had not the least thankfulness in 
my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on 
this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on idgment I only said ;> 

myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and U.in to be always miserable, 

It i* true, when I got on shore first here, an ,'s crew drown. . ;

littl. ' : as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring lub a few. 

The next day, being the 1 l-th, I went ha -k, having made me two small bags to bring 
harvest ; but I was Mirpri-e I when, coming to my heap of grapes, which were 
so rich and fin I M id them all spread abroad, trodden to pieces, 

and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By 
this I concluded there were somo wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; but 
what they were I knew not However, as I found there was no laying them up on 
heajM, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, 
and the other way they would be < h their own weight, I took another course ; 

fi I gathered a large quantity of thu grapes, and hung them upon the out branches of 
the trees, that they might cure an 1 dry in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons, I 
carried as many back as I could well stmd under. 

ame home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure the fruit- 
fulness of that isantness of the situation ; the security from storm 
on that side of the I i the wood : and concluded that I had pitched upon a place 
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, 
I began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally 
safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the 
i bad, 

thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some time, 
place tempting me ; but when I came to a nearer vi v, of it, 
nsidered that I was now by he sea sid.-. wl. possible that some- 

thing might lmpp<-n t<> my advantage; ami that the same ill fate that brought me hither, 
might bring some other unhappy wret and though it was tcapM 

able that any su.-h thing .should 6TW happen, yet to melon m\>elf among the hills 
woods in the centre of the island, was to ftl my bondage, and to render 

such an affair hot only imprnbahl,-, hut impossible; and that therefore I ought not by 
any means to remo i I was so enamoured with this plan-, that I spcal much 

:ue there i of the mouth of .July ; and though, 

n second thoughts, I resolved as above not to remove, yet I built m. a littl,. kind 
of a bowi-i with a strong fmer, being a double hedge, 

as high as I could reach, well staked, nnd filled betwe.-n \\ith brushwood ; and 1. 

'cure, sometimes two or tin luays going over it with a 

ladder as before; so th;. i my country house and my sea coast

the trees, and ; - n:l l'K v tnat 1 did so I'" 1 ' lut ' r;lin ^ w l'> - " followed would have 

spoiled tin-in, and I had lost the be>t part of my winter food; for I liad ab..vo two 
hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried 
most of tin-in home to n. 'it it l>egan t< i-ain ; and from hence, which was the 

1 Ith of Align more or less, every day till the middle of October, and 

sometimes so violently, ihat I could not stir out of my cave for several day>. 

In this season I \\as mueh .surprised with I my famil\ ; I had been 

concerned for the loss of one of my rats, who ran away from me. or, a* I thought, had 
been dead, and J heard no more tidings of her, till, to my a>toni>hment, .-he came home 
about the end of August, with three kittens. This wta the m..re strange to me, beeause. 
though I had killed a wild cat, as 1 called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a juite 
different kin' from ur European cats; but the young cats were the same kind of 

e-breed as the old one ; and both my cats being females, I thought it very sti. 

as 1 afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was 
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my hou 
much as possible. 

B the 14th of August to the 2Gth, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and 
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement, 1 began to be 
straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, 
which was the 20th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food 
was regulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the- goat's 
ties],, ( ,r of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great misfortune, J had no 
vessel to boil or >tew anything), and two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or three 
hours at enlarging my rave, and by degrees worked it on towards one side, till 1 came 
to the out.-ule of the hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or 
wall; and MI I came in and out this way. Hut I was not perfectly easy at lying so

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



The half of February, the whole of March, :inl the h:ilf of April rainy, the sun being 
then on or near the equinox. 

The half of April, the whole I uno, and July, and the half of August dry, 

the sun being then to the north of the lino. 

The half of August, the whole of September, an. I the half of October rainy, the sun 
U'ing then come back. 

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and the half 
bruary dry, the sun bring then to the south of the line. 

The rainy seasons sometimes held l-.n- winds happened to blo\v, 

but this was the general observation I made. After 1 had found, by experience, tin- ill 
consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions 
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as 
possible during the wet months. In this time I found much employment, and very 
suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion of many things which I had n> 
way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application ; particularly. I 
tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the pur; 
proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me 
now that when I was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at a basket - 
maker's, in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware : and 

.g, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner 
how they worked those things, and sometimes lent a hand, I had by this means so 
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials . when it 
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew 
might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers in England, and \ resolved 
to try. Accordingly, the next day I went to my country-house, as I called it, and 
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could 
desire ; whereupon 1 came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a 
quantity, which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them. These I set up to 
dry within my circle or hedges, and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my 
i here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well aa I 
many baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything 1 
had oera.sion ; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them 
sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be 
without them; and as my wickcr-waro decayed, I mad-- more, especially strong, deep 
baskets to place my corn in, instead of Harks, when I should QOfflfl to have, any 
quantity of it. 

II Dg B -red this difficulty, and -m ployed a world of time about it, T !> 

If to see, if possible. ho\v to supply two wants. I had m> vessel to hold an\ thing

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and that 1 had 
travelled up the brook, and ao on to where I built my bower, and where I had an 
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to gravel 
quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my 
dog, and u larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and 
a guat bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, 1 my journey. When 

I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as al M within view of the sea 

, to the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land -whether an i 
or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, u from the V. 

W.s.W., at a very great distance; by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or 
twenty leagues off.

it must be part of America, and, as 1 concluded, by all my observation*, n ir the

and fail n.>t t mu "do ! ami devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, I walked very l--i-mvly forward. I found that si le of

a ld"d to my grapes, Leadenhall Market could not have furnished a table b-'tt-T than I,

journeys, 1 turned homeward, the weather bei- -,d my gun, an.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and s< i/ed upon it, and f rum.

with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which 1 alway- carried abou 
him along, though with some, ditliculty, till I came to my bower, and tl 
him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been 
absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to mo to come into my old : 
lit; down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey, without settled pL 
abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, an I calhd it to as a 

perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about me so 
comfortable, that I revived I would never go a great way from it again, while 
be my lot to stay on the inland. 

I repo-ed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long journey; 
during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty atl'air of making a cage 
for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to bo mighty well aopia: 
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had pent in within my little 
circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it .some food ; aoOQ 
found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for 
of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of Mich shr uld find, 

and threw them over, and having fed it, E tied it as 1 did before, t" had . but 

it was BO tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied /. 
like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so } 

fond, that it became from that tim ie of my domestics also, and would never 1

The rainy BeaBOO of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the .'><lth of

possible I might l>e more happy in this solitary condition than T should have been in 
a liberty of society, and in nil the pleasures of the world: that He could fully make 
up to mo the i.-s of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by his 

presence, and the communication of his grace to my soul ; supporting, comforting, and 
encouraging me to depend npon his providence here, and hope for his eternal presence 
hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy the life I now led 
was, with all its miserable circumstances, than 1 1 bominable life I led 

all the past part of my days; and now having changed both my sorrows and my joys; 
inv very desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were per- 
fectly new from what they were at first coming, or, indeed, for the two years p. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the country, the 
anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very 
heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, 
and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an 
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures 
of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my 
hands, and weep like a child: sometimes it would take mo in the middle of my work, 
and I would imm ! down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or 

two together; and this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent 
myself by words, it would go off, and the grief Laving exhausted itself would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I daily read the Word of 

God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state. One morning, being very 

sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake 

" Immediately it occurred that these words were to me ; why else should they 

be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my con- 

M, as one forsaken of God and man ? "Well, then," said I, "if God does not 

forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the wild 

should all forsake me, seeing, on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose

From this moi .; m to conclude \ n ln y mind that it was p's>ilile for me to 

be more happy in this for>iken, solitary condition, than it, was probable 1 should ever 

been in any other part ienlar state in the world ; and witli this thought I was going 

to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but 

something shocked my mind at that thought, and I di; -ak tlie words. " Ho\v

any ,rd--r of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for ashling me afterwards to

and in this disposition of mind, I began iay third year ; and though 1 have 
not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my works th

irly divided my time according to several daily employments that were before

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Mich as, first, my duty to God, and tin; muling tin- Scriptures, which I constantly 
set apart some time for, thrico every day ; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for 
food, which generally took up three hours morning, when it did not rain; 

thirdly, tho ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught for 
my supply : these took up great part of the day ; also, it is to bo considered, that in the 
middle i>f the day, when the sun was in the xenith, tho violence of tho heat was too 
great to stir out; so that about four hours in tho evening was all the time I could be 

>sed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of 
hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gnu in 
the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may bo added the exceeding laborious- 

of my work ; the many hours which for want of tools, want of help, and want of 

skill, everything I did took up out of my time : for example, I was full two-and- 

forty days in making a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas 

itli their tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same 

tree in half a day. 

ease was this : it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down, because my 

board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days a cutting down, and two 

cutting oil' the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With inex- 

ible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it began to 
be light enough to move ; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and Hat as 
a board from end to end ; then turning that side downward, cut the other side till I 
brought tho plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one 
in iv judge the labour of my hands in such apiece of work; but labour and patience 
carried me through that, and many other things ; I only observe this in particular, to 
show the reason why so much of my time went away with so little work, viz., that what 
illicit l>e a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and required a pro- 
digious time to do alone, and bv hand. .But notwithstanding this, with patience an I 
labour, I went through many things, and indeed everything that my circumstance i made 
necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of barley 

and rice. The ground F had m mured or dug up for them was n.,t great; for, as I 

: . my Med of each wa.s not above the .|iiantity of half a peck, for I had lost one 

whole crop by sowing in the dry seas.m : but now my crop promised very well, when on 

a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by enemi 

whieh it v ! to keep from i* ; as, first, the goats, and wild en-dun-- 

which I called li;in-, whi.-h, taking tl,- I of the blade, l.iy in it night ami day,

the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grewv and well, and began to 

ripen apace.

but coining up to the h--.i.,"-, 1 tired again, and killed three of th"in. This was what I

Kiudand, viz., hang.-d them in chains for a terror toothers. It is impossible to ima. 
almost that this should have had such an effect as it had, for the. fowls would

never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there, Thil 1 
glad of, you may 1- 1 about the latter end of December, which was OUT si-- 

harvest of the year, 1 reaped my corn. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all 1 could do was to 
make one, as well as I could, out of one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, whi 
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I 
great difficulty to cut it down ; in short, I ivape I it in my way, for I cut nothing off 
but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which 1 had made, and so rub! 
out with my hands ; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half- 
peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley ; 
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that in time it 
would please God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was perpl -x-d again, for 
I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and 
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how t 
J knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my de>ire of having a good 
quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, 1 resolved not to taste any of this 
crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the D :.d, in the me. in time, to 

employ all niy study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing 
If with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. It is a little wonderful, 
and what I believe few people have thought milch upon, vi/.., the stranin* multitude of 
little thi. try in the providing, producing, curing, 

thifl one article of bread.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



nit-lit and was made more and more sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the 
tii M handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed 
to a surprise. 

l'ir.-t, 1 had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or shovel to dig it. Well, 
this 1 conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed before; but this did my 
wrk but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it, 
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and 
made it be performed much worse. However, this I bore with too, and was content to 
\\ork it out with patience, and bear with tin- badness of the performance. When the 
e..rn was M.WU, 1 had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great 
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than rake or liar- 
row it. AVhen it Mas growing, or grown, I have observed already how many things 
I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it 
iiom the ehatl', and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, } 
and sah to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and all these things J did 
without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and 
advantage to me too. But this, as I said, made everything laborious and tediou 

but that there was no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me, because, 
as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works; and 
as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, 
1 had the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish 
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations necessary for making 
the corn, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow above an 
acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a spade, 
whieh, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it. However, I went through that, and sowed my seed in 
two large Cat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and 
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that wood 
which 1 had set before, which I knew would grow ; so that, in one year's time, I knew I 
should have a quick or living hedge, that woidd want but little repair. This work was 
not so little as to take me up less than three months, because great part of that time. 

of the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within-door, that is when it rained, 
and I could not go out, I found employment in the following occupations al 

ving that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, 
and teaching him to .speak; and I quickly learnt him to know his own name, and at last 
to speak it out pretty loud, " Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the 
island by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but a it to 

my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands as follows: vi/, 
I had long studied, by some means or other, to make my-. 1C some earthen \ liich, 

indeed, 1 wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However, considering 
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, 1 might 
botch up some such pot as might, being dried 1>\ the sun, be hard enough and strong 
enough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept 
so ; and as this was necessary in preparing e.rn, nn al, Are., whieh was tho thing I was 
upon, 1 resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many awkward 

80 ^-~ *_^ 












rf 

i ways I took to raise this pa^te ; what 

things 1 made ; how many of them fdl in, and how many fell o . 
elav not being stitl' enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked 
by the over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how- 
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well b- 

dried; and, in a word, how, after ha\ing laboured hard to find the clay 
to dig it, to temper it^ to bring it home, and work it I could

months' labour.

Si 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made several 
smaller things with better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, 
and pipkins, and anything my hand turned to ; and the heat of the sunbaked them 
strangely hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, whieh was to get an earthen pot to hold 
what was liquid, and bear the tire; whieh none of these could do. It happened after 
some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out 
after I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in 
the lire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. 1 was agreeably surprised to see 
it, and said to iny>elf that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they would 
burn broken. 

me to study how to order my fire so as to make it burn me some pots. I had 
no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I 
had some lead to do it with; but I placet I three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in 
a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of 
embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the 
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed that they did 
not crack at all; when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about live 
or six hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for th-- 
sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would 
have run into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began 
to abate of the red colour, and watching them all night, that I might not let the fire 
abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, 
and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them 
perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of earthenware for my 

: but I must needs say as to the shapes of them they were very indifferent, as any 
one may suppose, when I had no way of making them but as the children make dirt 
pies, or as a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when 1 found I 
had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay 
till they were cold before I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me 
some meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of a kid I mad- some very 
good broth, though I wanted oatmeal and several other ingredient* requisite to make it 
as good as I would have had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some com in ; for 
as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that perfeetioii of art with one pair 
of hands. To supply this want I was at a great IcNBj for, of all tin- trade* in the world, 
I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I 
any tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find outa great stone big enough 
to cut hollow, and make tit for a mortal-, and could find none at all, except what was in 
the solid rock, and whieh 1 had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the roeks in 
the ivhuid of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which would 
neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling it with 
sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in s-arching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved 
to look out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed mueh easier ; and getting 
one as big as I had strength t<- - :i, 1 rounded it and formed it on the outside with my 

and hatchet, and then, with the help of fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place

All the while these things WIMV doing, you may In* sure my thoughts ran inanv times 
upon the prospect of laiul which I had seen from the other side of the island ; and I 
was not without secret wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that, seeing the 
main-laud, and an inhabited country, I might find some way or other to eonvev myself 
la it her, and perhaps at last find some in 

Hut all this while I made no allowance f..r the dan-- IN of such a condition, and 
ho\v I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps surh as I might have reason to 
think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa : that if I once came into their power 
I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of 
being eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or 
men-eaters, and 1 kne\v by the latitude tl;at I could not be far iff from that shore : that 
suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many European! who had 
fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty 

her -much more I, that was but one, and could make little or no defence; all 
thing-. I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts 
afterwards, yet took n] > none of my apprehensions :i t first, and my head ran mightilv 
upon the thought of getting over to that shore. 

Now, I wi>hed for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder -of-mutton 
sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in 
vain : then I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, 

Mown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. 
She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite, and was turned, by the force of the 
waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against the high ridge of beachy, roimh sand, 
but no water about her as b -f,re. If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have, 
launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might have 
gone back into the J'.ri/uls with her easily enough; but I might hare easily foreseen that 
I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than J could remove 
the island ; however, I went to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them 
to the boat, resolved to try what I could do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but 
turn her down, I might easily repair the damage she had received, and she would he 
'.- good boat, and 1 might go to sea in her very easily. 

'ns, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I think, three or 
four weeks about it; at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my little strength, 
I fell to digging away the Bind, to undermine it. and so to make it fall down, setting 
of wood to thrust and guide ft right in the fill. 

l!ut when T had do M- this I was unable to stir it up a train. .r to get umler it, much 
less to m-ive it forward towards the water; sol iverj and 

though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my d< r for the main in- 

creased, rather than decrca-e 1, as the means for it, seemed impossible. 

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not pos>ihle to make m\

I mi_rht say, without hands vi/.., of the trunk 6f| I not only thought

I went to work upon this Ixxit the most like a fool that ever man did, who had any 
of his senses awake. I ph-a-M-d myself with the design, without determining whether I 
was ever able to undertake it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came 
often into my head; but I put a stop to my inquiries into it, by this foolish answer 
which I gave myself: " Let me first make it; I warrant I shall find some way or other 
to get it along when it is done." 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and 
to work I w. nt, and felled a cedar-tree. I question much whether Solomon ever had 
such a one for the building the Temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches 
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the 
end of twenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted into 
branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty 
days haeking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches 
and limbs and the -ling head of it cut off, which 1 hacked and hewed through 

with my axe and hatchet, and im-xpressibh- labour; after this, it cost me a month to 

p6 it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it 

might swim Upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more t-> clear the

her retlection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to any one that 
should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this was, to compare my present condition 
with what I at first expected it would be ; nav, with what it would certainly have been, 
if the good providence of God had not wondorfullv ordered the ship to be cast up neat er

lit whole hours, 1 may say whole days, in representing to myself, in the most 
lively colours, how f must have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship. How 1 could 
not have so much as got any food, except iish and turtles; and that, as it washing 
I found any of them, I must have perished first ; that I should have lived, if I 
had not perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any con- 
trivance. I had no way to Hay or open it, or part the lle-h from the skin and the bowels, 
or to cut it up ; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast. 
reflections made me verv sensible of the goodness of Providence to me, and 
very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes : and this

improvement of these things. 1 \ v ' >nd was no more sad. 1 had now beei. 

80 long, that many things which I brought on shore for my In -]p weiv either quite gone 

mch wasted and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little, which 1 eked 
vitli water, a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scan-e left any appearan 
black UJK)!! the paper. As long as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days 
of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me ; and first, by casting up 
times past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various 
providences which befell me, and which, if 1 had been superciliously inclined to ob 

us fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a great 
deal of curiosity. 

. I had ob>,-rved. that the same day that I broke away from my father and my 

friend.-,, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to S( .' day afterwards I \\as 

i by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave ; the same day of the year that 1 

escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth lloads. that same day of the year 

.-wards I made my escape from Sallee in a boat; the same day of the year 1 wu 

born on, viz., the 20th of September, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved 

K years after, when I was cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked life 

and solitary life began both on a day. 

\t thing to my ink being wasted, was that of iny bread I mean, the biscuit 
which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing 
myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year ; and yet I was quite without bread 
I got any corn of my own ; and great reason I had to be thankful 
that I hud any at all, the getting it bcing> as lias been already ob.sc \t to 

miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily ; as to linen, I had had none a good while, 
except some chequered shirts which 1 found in the chests of the other seamen, and which 1 
carefully presci uise many times I could bear no oil ..n but a shirt ; and 

-ry great help to me that J had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, abnot 
three dozen of shirts. There were also MTOT*] thiek the .seamen's which 

were left behind, but they were too hot to wear : and though it is true that the weather 
was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quid naked 
IK., though J had been inclined to it, which I was not ; nor c mid I abide the thoughts of 
it, though I was all alone. One reason why I could not go nak.-d was, I could 
the heat of the sun so well wh-n quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the | 
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a shirt on, tl. if made some 

motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more 
could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat ; the 
"f the sun, beating with such violence as it does in that place, would give me the 
ntly, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that 
I could not bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away. 

Ujwn these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I had, which I 
called clothes, into some order ; I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my bubi-

i. . 1 pi a great deal of time ami pains to make an umbrella. I was in- 

1 1 in great want of one, ami had a great mind to make one. L had seen them mt i 

the I'ra/.ils, where they are very useful in the great heats which arc there, and i 

i ere, and greater too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, a- I was 
]>e much abroad, it was a most useful tiling to me, as w.-ll for the rains as tho 
lieats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while before j e.,<ild make any- 
thing likely to hold ; nay, after [ thought I had hit the way, I spoil, -d t\vo or thn.-o be- 

ie to my mind. But at last I made one that answered indiii'. rently 
the ni-iin diilloulty I found was to make it to let down. I could make it spread, but if it 
did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for me any way but 
my head, which would not do. However, at la>t, as I .-aid, I made one to answer. I 
covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and 
kept olV the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weatlW with 
ter advantage than I could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, I 
could close it, and carry it under my arm.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not 
get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, of near half a mile, yet, as 
I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it OV.T ; an. I though I was near two years 
about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at 
last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was not at all 
answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the first ; I mean of ventur- 
ing over to the terra firma, where it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the 

"mess of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more 
of it As I had a boat, my next design was to make a tour round tin- island ; for as I 
had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over 
tin' land, so the discoveries I made in that journey made me very eager to see other 
parts of the coast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the 
island. 

For this propose, and that I might do everything with discretion and consideration, I 
fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of tho 
ship'.-* sail* which lay in store, and of which I had a great store by me. Having t 
my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would sail very well ; then 1 mad 
little lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, ammunition, 
Ac., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little, long, 
hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap 
to hang down over it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to stand over my head, 
and keep the heat of the s,un off of me, like an awning. And thus I every now and then 
took a little voyage upon the sea ; but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. 
At last, being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my 
tour; and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of 
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parch. , I 
rice (a food I ate a great deal of), a little bottle of ruin, half a goat, and powder with shot 
tor killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had 
saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover 
me in the night. 

I 1 was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my captivity, which 
you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected ; 
for though tho island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, 
I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water, 
some under it ; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so that I 

obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that point. 

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise, and come l.a< -k 
again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea ; and, above all, doubt- 
ing how I should get back again ; so I came to an anchor ; IT 1 had made a kind of an 
anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which I got out of the >hip. 

Having secured myboat^I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a hill, which 
seemed to overlook that point where I saw tin- full extent of it, ami resolved to \enture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong and, in- 

i, a most furious current, which ran to the east, and \, n came close to the point; 

and I took the more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger, that when 

ue into it, T might be carried out 'ii;th of it, and not be able to 

92 ,* 


















J CttKOC SAILS 9UT OF K1C CREEK.I? 




make the island again. And, indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I Mi- 
would have been so; for there was the same current on the other side of 1 
only that it set off at a farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the 
shore ; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first current, and I should presently l.e 
in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind Mowing pretty fresh . and 

that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach of the sea upon tl.- 
that it was not safe for me too keep too close to the shore fur the bivaeh, n..r to go too far 
oil', because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the sea was calm, 

and I ventured. But I aui a warning-piece t > all ra>h and ignorant pilots; for no sooner 

I come to the point, when I was not even my b-.;it's length from the ,-lmre. but I found 

myself in a great depth of water, and .1 eurn-nt like, the sluice of a mill. It carried my 

93

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



boat along with it with such violence that all I could do couM not koop her so much as 
on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which 
was on my left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with 
my paddles signified nothing. And now I began to give myself over for lost ; for as the 
current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they must join 
a^ain, and then I was irrecoverable gone ; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it ; 
so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm 
enough, but of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the shore, as 
big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into th . boat ; and I had a great jar of fresh 
water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was all this to bcin.n driven into 
the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a 
thousand leagues at 1. 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make the most 
miserable condition that mankind could be in worse. Now I looked back upon my 
lesolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness 
my heart could wish for was to be there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with 
eager wishes. "O happy desert !" said I, "I shall never see thee more. O miserable 
creature ! whither am I going ?" Then I reproached myself with my unthankful tem- 
per, and how I had repined at my solitary condition ; and now what would I give to 
be on shore there again ! Thus, we never see the true state of our condition till it is 
illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the 
want of it. It is scarcely possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being 
driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to mo now to be) into the wide ocean, 
almost two leagues, :U1 ,1 } n the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, I 
worked hard till, indeed, my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much 
to the northward that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on as 
!>ly I could ; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a 
little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the S.S.E. This cheered my heart a 
little, and especially when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small, gentle gale. 
By this time, I had got at a frightful distance from the island; and had the least cloudy 
or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way, too ; for I had no compass 
on board, and should never have known how to have steered towards the island, if I 
had but once lost sight of it. But the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get 
up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, 
to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I saw even 
by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was near ; for where the 
current was so strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found 
the current abate; and presently I found to the east, at about half a mile, a In 
of the sea upon some rocks. These rocks I found caused the current to part a.^ain, and. 
as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so 
the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back 
again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the ladder, or 
to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who have been in such ex- 
tremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat 
into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also fiv-:h-nin<,', how gladly I spread my sail 
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.

and dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me ; 
luit us the voice continued to repeat, " Robin Crusoe ! Robin Crusoe !" at last I began to 
awake more perfectly, and WM at first dreadfully frightened, and Marted up in tho utmost 
consternation. But no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top 
of the hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that si>oke to me ; for just in such 
bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach him : and lie had learned it 
so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and 
cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are you 1 Where have you been 1 How came

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could be nobody 
else, it was a good while before I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the 
creature got thither ; and then, how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere 
else ; but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and 
holding out my hand, and calling him by his name, " Poll," the sociable creature came 
to m> upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, " Poor 

Robin Crusoe ! and how did I come here 1 and where had I been ?" just as if lie had 
been overjoyed to see me again ; and so I carried him home along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough to do for 
many days, to sit still, and reflect up<u the danger I had been in. I would have been 
V-TV glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island ; but I knew not how it 
was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the island, which I had gone 
round, I knew well enough there was no venturing that way ; my very heart would 
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the 
island, 1 did not know how it might be there. But supposing the current ran with the 
same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the other, I might run 
the same risk of being driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been 
b. -fore of b.-ing carried away from it. So with these thoughts I contented mys.-lf to be 
without any boat, though it had been the product of so many months' labour to make 
it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. ; 

In this government of my temper, I remained near a year; lived a very soda te. 
retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being very much compos, I 
as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of 
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things, except that of 
society. 

I improved myself in this time in all tin- meehanie 6X61*01668 whi<-h my 
put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should, upon occasion, have made a 
-'od r;irp, cially considering ho\v few tools I had. 

I . i it an unexpeeti-d perfection in my earthenware, and contrived 
well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found intiniti -ly easier and b 
because I made things round and shaped, \\hi.-h before were filthy things indeed to look 
on. But I think I was never more vain of my own pei-formam-i-. Off m-'n joyful for 
anything I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ; and though it 
\ery ugly, clumsy thing when it was d<>ne. and only burnt ivd, like other eart lien- 
ware, yet as it WBfl hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly com- 
1 with it, for I had been always used to smoke ; and i the ship, 

but I forgot them at first, not thinking that then 1000 in the island : and after- 

wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not come at my pipes. 

In my wickenvarc also I improved mueh. and made abundance of necessary baskets,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 




as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome, yet they were sucli as 
were very handy ami convenient lor laying things up in, or fetching tilings home. For 
example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and 
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket : and the like by a turtle; I could cut it 
up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough forme, and bring 
them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets were 
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and curt d ; 
and kept it in great baskets, instead of a granary. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; and this was a want which 
it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what I must do 
when I should have no more powder ; that is to say, how I should do to kill any goaN. 
I had, as I observed in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her 
up tame; I was in hopes of getting a he-kid : but I could not by any means bring 
it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat ; and as I could never find in my heart to kill 
her, she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh y.ar of my residence, and, as I have said, my 
ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats, to 
see whether I could not catch some of them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she- 
goat great with young. To this purpose, I made snares to hamper them ; and I 
1) -lieve they were more than once taken in them ; but my tackle was not good, for I 
h id no wire, and always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length, I 
resolved to try a pitfall : so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where I had 
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles, of my own making 
too, with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears of barley and dry 
rice, without setting the trap ; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in 
and eaten up the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three 
traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing, and yet the 
bait eaten and gone : this was very discouraging. However, I altered my traps; and, 
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one 
of them a large old he-goat; and in one of the others, three kills, a male and two 

<ie8. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so fierce, I durst not, 
go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which 
w.is what I wanted. I could have killed him, hul that was not my business, nor would 
it answer my end ; so I even let him out, and he ran away as if he had been frighted 
out of his wits ; but 1 had forgot then what I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame 
a lion. If I had h-t him stay there three or four days without food, and then ha\e 
carried him some water to drink, and then a little OOFB, he would hive leen as tam 
one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures where they are 
well used. 

However, for the present I let him g-, knowing no Letter at that time ; then I went 
to the tlir- nid, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and 

with some difficulty brought them all home. 

It was a Rood while before they would feed ; but. throwing them WDM sweet corn, it 
tempted them, and t h y b, -an to be tame. And now I found that if I e\|.,--ted to 
supply myself with goats' flesh, when I had no powder or shot, left, breeding some up 
tame was my only way; when, perhaps. I might have them about my house like a lloek 
of sheep. l>ut, then, it occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else

lives of all my subjects at absolute command : I e Mild hang, draw, give lit'.- and lib 
aiul take it away, ami no reU-U among all my subjects. TlnMi to see h >w like a king I 
(lined too, all alone, attended by my servants ' Pull, as if h> had been my favourite, 
was the only j>ersou permitted to talk to me ; my dog, who was now grown very old 
and cra/y, and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right 
hand ; and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the other, expecting now 
and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for they were 
both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by my own hand ; but 
one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two 
which I preserved tame ; whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became 
indeed troublesome to me at last ; for they would often come into my house, and plunder 
me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many ; at length 
they left me. With this attendance and in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither 
eiiuld I be said to want anything but society; and of that, in some time after tli 
\\as likely to have too niueh. 

1 was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my boat, though 
very loth to run any more hazard; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to 
get her about the island, and at other times I sat mvsrlf d<wn contented enough with- 
out her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the 
island where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore 
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to do : this inclination in- 
creased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land; and follow- 
ing the edge of the shore, I did so ; but had any one in England met such a man as I 
was, it must cither have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laughter : and as I 
frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my 
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased 
to take a sketch of my figure, as follows : 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's skin, with a Hap hanging down 
behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain <>H' from running into my 
neck; nothing being so hurtful iu these climates as the rain upon the flesh under 
the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down t<> about the middle of 
the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same ; the breeches were made of 
the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that, like 
pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my kini,'* and shoes I had none, but 

had made me a pair of Hum-things. I seam- knew what to call them, like buskii 
Hap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat terda>hes, but of a mo>i barbarous 
shape, as in. lee. i were all the rest, of my clothes. 

1 had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together \\ith two thongs. 
of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead ' 
a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one. on the 
other. I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung 
o\ .1 my shoulder ; and at the end of it, under my left, arm. hung t wo pouches, both made 
of goat'> skin too, in one of "which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my 
back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy, 
ugly, goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all, wa> the moM y thing I 

had about me next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it w.is really not so

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



' mulatto-like as one might expect from a umn not at all careful uf it, ami living within 

i nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My l>-anl I hail i-nee suilered to ^n>w till it was 

about a quarter of a yard long ; but as 1 had both scissors and razors sutlieient, I hail 

( cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a 

1 large pair of Mahometan whi>k-rs, such as 1 liad seen worn by some Turks at Bailee, 

for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did ; of these moustachios, or 

whiskers, I will not Hay they were long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they 

were of a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have 

passed for frightful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe me, that it 
WM of no manner of consequence, so I say no more t<> that part. In this kind of dress I 
went my new journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea- 
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get up upon 
the rocks; and having no boat now to take care of, I went over the laud a nearer way 
to the same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the point of the 
rock which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as I said above, 
I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippling, n-> motion, no current, 
any more there than in other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, 
and resolved to spend Home time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of 
the tide had occasioned it ; but I was presently convinced how it was, viz., that the tide 
of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters from some great 
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current ; and that according as the 
wind blew more forcible from the west or from the north, this current came near, or 
went farther from the shore ; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the 
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as 
before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the shore, whereas in 
my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in my canoe alonjj with it, which 
at another time it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the ebbing 
ami the flowing of tin- tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the isl.ind 
again ; but when I began to think about putting it in practice, I had such terror upon 
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it 
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took up an.tli.-r resolution, which was 
more safe, though more laborious and this WJIM, that I would build, or rather make 
me another periagua or canoe; and HO have one for one side of the island, an 1 
for t'le oth.-r. 

Y"H are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations in the 

i : one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under the rock, with 

the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments, or 

caves, one within another. One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had a 

door out beyond my wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond \\here my wall joined 

to the rock, was all tilled up with the large earthen pots, of which 1 ha\e gi\eu an 

account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels 

. where I laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the e ir, cut 

off short from the straw, and the other nibbed out with my hand. 

i my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or pile,, ih-^e piles grew all like 
trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so very mm h, that there was not 
the least appearance, to any one's view, of anv habitation behind them.

CRT ot'NTRY HOUSE AND I 




Near thin dwelling of mine, l.ut a little farth.-r \\ithin the land, an 1 upon lower 
Around, lay my t\vi |>ii -.-,> ,,f oorn land, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and 
\\hich ilulv yielded in-- tip ir I, irvcat in its .- n : an<l win-never I had oocaaoi. 
more corn. I had more land adjoining, as fit an that 

Besides thi . I Lid my country seat, and 1 Lid n\v a tolerable plantation 
also; I'-;- tii t. I had my 1 i 1 1 lo bower, as I called it, which I kepi in repair that is to 
say, I kept the hed^e, which circled it in, constantly fitted up to iu usual height, tin- 
la.ld.-r standing always in the inside ; I kept the trees, which at first were no more 
than my stakes, hut were now grown very firm and tall, always so cut, that they in. 
>d and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did 
ually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a 
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for thv pm-p .so, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins 
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on them. 
such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved ; and a great watch-coat to cover 
me ; and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my 
country habitation. 

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my goats ; and 
as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclose this ground, I was so 
anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off 
till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, 
and so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce 
room to put a hand through between them ; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, 
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the inclosure strong like a wall, indeed 
stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains to bring to 
pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support ; for I considered the 
keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine 
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be 
f< Tty years ; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting 
my inclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together ; which, 
by this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that when these little stakes began 
to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to pull some of them 
up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my 
winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best 
and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet ; and, indeed, they were not agreeable only, 
but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree. 

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the place where I 
had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way thither, for I used 
frequently to visit my boat ; and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very 
good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous 
voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so 
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, 
or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life. 

1 1 happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised 
with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on 
the >and. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, 

103 



ROBINSON CRT 



I looked round me, but I couKl ln-ar nothing, nor see anything ; I went up to a 
ground, to look farther ; I went up the shore, and down the shoiv, but it was all one : 
I could see no other impression but that one. I went to it again to see if there were 
any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, 
for there was exactly the print of a foot toes, heel, and every part of a foot How it 
came thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But after innumerable 
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my 
fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, 
looking behind me at every two or three -tq>s, mistaking every bush and tree, and 
fancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it poasible to describe how 
many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented tilings ,0 me in ; how many 
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and what strange unaccountable 
whimseys came into my thoughts by the way. 

"When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I fled into it 
like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at 
the hole in the rock, which I called a door, I cannot remember ; for never frighted 
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. 

I had no sleep that night ; the farther I was from the occasion of my fright, the greater 
my apprehensions were, which is something contrary to the nature of such things, and 
especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear ; but I was so embarrassed with 
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to 
myself, even though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the 
devil ; and reason joined in with me upon this supposition : for how should any other thing 
in human shape come into the place ? Where was the vessel that brought them 1 What 
marks were there of any other footsteps ? And how was it possible a man should come 
there? But then to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a 
place, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his 
foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I should 
it this was an amazement the other way. I considered that the devil might have 
found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a 
: that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never ha\<> been so 
simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should 
ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, 
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed ineon>i.stent with the tiling itself, and 
with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted t> argue me out of all nppivhen>ions of 
its being the devil ; and I presently concluded then, that it must bo some more 
dangerous creature; viz., that it must be some of the savage* of the mainland over 
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either driven by tin- 
currents or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on slmre. but | 
- n away again to sea ; being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island 
HS I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were roll ing uj on my mind. I was very thankful in my thought, 
that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my 

boat, by which they would have concluded that some inh il-it mts had 1 n in the place, j 

and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagi- 
nation about their having found my boat, and that there were people h.-re ; and that, 
if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers, and devour me ; <

it .should happen that they should not find me, yet they would find my

we shim ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the 
sions of. This was exemplified in me at this time in the most lively manner imaginable ; 
for I, whose only affliction was, that I seemed banished from human society, that I 
was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned 
to what I call silent life ; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be 
numbered among the living, or to appear amongst the rest of his creatures ; that to 1m v 
seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to lit'.-, 
and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, 
could bestow ; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a 
man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a 
man having set his foot on the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it afforded me a great many curious 
speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first surprise. I consider* ! 
that this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of God had 
determined for me ; that as I could not foresee what the end of Divine wisdom might 
be in all this, so I was not to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I was His creature, had 
an undoubted right by creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as He thought 
fit ; and who, as I was a creature who had offended Him, had likewise a judicial right to 
condemn me to what punishment He thought fit ; and that it was my part to submit to 
bear His indignation, because I had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that God, who 
was not only righteous, but omnipotent, as He had thought fit thus to punish and afflict 
me, so He was able to deliver me ; that if He did not think fit to do it, it was my 
unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to His will ; and, on the other 
hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend the dictates 
and directions of His daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and months ; and 
one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit ; viz., one morning 
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearance 
of savages, I found it discomposed me very much ; upon which those words of the 
S.-ripture came into my thoughts : " Call upon me in the day of trouble : I will 
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of bed, my 
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God 
for deliverance : when I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, 
the first words that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord : be of good courage, 
and He shall strengthen thy heart : wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to 
express the comfort this gave me, and in return I thankfully laid down the book, and was 
no more sad, at least, not on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it came into my 
thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot 
might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my l>oat : this cheen-d 
me up a little, too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was 
nothing else but my own foot ; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as 
well as I was going that way to the boat ? Again I considered also, that I could by no 
means tell for Qertain where I had trod, and whore I had not; and that if, at 1 ,i<t, this 
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part of thOM foals who try t . nuke 
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are themselves frighted at them m >n- than 
anybody else. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not stirred out of

Heartening myself, therefore, with the t t this was nothing but the print 

of one of my own feet, and so I mL- y said to start at my own shadow, I began to 

go abroad again, and w. k my flock ; but to see with what

go down to the .shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and sea 
if there was any similitude or titn<- . that I mi_'ht be assured it was my own foot. But 
when I cam.- to tin- j.lar.-- -tir.-t, it appeared evidently to me, that when I hii<l up my 
boat, I could not po^jhly be on shore anywhere thereabouts : secondly, when I came to 
measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal 
Both the-,,- tilings tilled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again 
to the ir ] '-e, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague; and I went home 

again, filled with the helief that some man or men had been on shore there ; or, in short, 
ih" i ' in 1 was inli il.i'rd, and I miidit he surprised before I was aware ; and what 
course to take for my security I knew not 

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with feai i -rives 

them of the use of those means which reason offers for their relief. The first thing I 
proposed to myself was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild 
int.. the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and then frequent the inland in 
prospect of the same or the like booty : then the simple thing of digging up my two < 
fields, that they might not find such a grain there, and still he prompted to frequent the 
i.-land ; then to demolish my bower and tent, that they mi^ht n<>t see any vestiges of 
habitation, and he prompted to i...,k farther, in order to find out- the persons inhabiting. 
These were the subjects of the first night's cogitations, after I was come home again 
while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were fre>h upon me, and my 
head was full of vapours as above. Thus, (ear of danger is ten thousand times more 
terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the harden of 
r, hy much, than the evil which we are anxious about : but, which was 
6 than all this, I had not that relief in this troul.le, from the r'M_'na'i.>n I used to

107 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



with myself, I concluded thai this island (which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no 
farther from the main laud than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned a* I might 
imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet tliat 
there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps 
never but when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place ; that 1 had 
lived here fifteen jean now, and had not nut with the least shadow or figure of any 
people yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven hero, it was probable they 
went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here 
upon any occasion to this time ; that the most I could suggest any danger from was, 
from any casual accidental landing of straggling ]>eople from the main, who, as it was 
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills ; so they made no stay 
here, but went off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, 
lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again ; and that, 
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should 
see any savages land uj>on the spot. 

Now I began sorely to rej>ent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring a door 
through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to 
the rock. Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second 
fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where 
i planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mcnt i. >n : 
these trees having been planted so thick before, there wanted but few piles to be driven 
between them, that they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon 
finished. So that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with i 
pieceo of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of to make it strong, having , 
in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of th is, 
I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing earth out of my 
cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; and through the seven 
hole* I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven ou . 
shoreo.it of the ship; these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into 
frames, that held them like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two 
in inutes* time. This wall I was many aweary month in finishing, and yet never thought 
myself safe till it was dona 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great way every 

:il with stakes or sticks of the osier like wood, which 1 found so apt to grow, i 
as they could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might s in m-ar twenty thousand '| 
of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have 
room to MM an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they 
pled to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two year-' time. I had a thick grove; and in t year>' time I had a 

wool b. !'..! my dwelling grown |Q mon-trous thick and strong that it w:us indeed 
perfectly impassable : and no man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there 
Waa.anything bovond it, much le-, a habitation. As for the way which I pn.p,,-ed t.. 
myself to go in aifd out (for I ] -ft no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one i 

of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder 
upon that; so Mhen the two ladd .ken d\vn, no man living could come down A 

mischiefing himself: and if they had come down, thry were still on J 
,,f my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measure- human prudence con], I r my o\\n preservation ; 

108 // 






ROBINSON CRUSOK. 



and it will be seen, at length, that they were not Altogether without just reason ; though 
' I foresaw nothing at that time more than my HUT.- fear suggested to mo. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs ; for I had a 
great concern upon me for ray little herd of ^oats : they were not only a present supply 
to me upon every -occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of 
powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones ; and I 
was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways to preserve 
them : one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to 
drive them into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of 
land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep 
alut half a dozen young goats in each place ; so that if any disaster happened to the 
flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time : and 
this, though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the most 
rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island ; and 
I pitched upon one which was as private indeed as my heart could wish : it was a 
little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that way from the 
eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so sur- 
rounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by Nature; at least, it did not want 
near so much labour to make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, in less than a month's 
time, I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which 
were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured 
in it So, without any further delay, I removed ten she-goats, and two he-goats, 
to this piece ; and, when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till 1 hail 
made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me 
up more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions on the 
account of the print of a man's foot which I had seen ; for, as yet, I had never seen 
any human creature come near the island ; and I had now lived two years under this 
uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it wa> before, as 
may well be imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear 
of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the discomposure of my mind 
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and 
terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I 
seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker ; at least, not with the 
s>-date calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do : I rather prayed to God 
as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in 
expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I mu-t 
testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, h.\e, and alleeiioii, is 
n.ueli the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and di.-comp.-ure ; and that 
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a com (bit in;: performance 
of the duty of praying to God, than he is for repentance on a sick bed ; for these 
di-coiuposures affect the mind, as the others do the boJy : and the discomposure of the 
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater ; 
praying t> God b -ini: properly an act of the mind, not of the body.

to go on : after I luul thus necured 000 pni - *Uck f I went 

^t IH.II -land than I had ever done yet, and 

4 out to sea, I thought I RAW a bout upon the Ma, at a great distance. I had found 

glass or two in one of the seamen's cheat*, which I saved out of our ship, 

about me ; and thw wan no remote that I could not tell what to make 

:' it. though 1 looked at it till my even were not able to bold to look any longer: 

it was a boat it ax I descended from the lull I could aw 

no more of it, an I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a 

perspective glass in my pocket 

When 1 was come down the hill to the end of the inland, where, indeed, I had never 

been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing ti. a man's foot was not 

the inland as I imagined ; and but th.it it was a special providence 

! -Hi the side of the island \\ i<- i t he savages never came, I should easily 

D 1 1 nit nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when 

nod to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that M island 

t r li;u U.ur : like\\ ise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having 

,nx over to this shore, where, according to their 

dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; of which hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the 8.W. point 

island, I was perfective. .11 founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express 

the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 

bones of human bodies ; and particularly, I observed a place where there had been a fire 

made, and a _ in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches 

lia.l Nit down to their inhuman feasting** upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no notions of 
any dan;," -r to myself from it for a long while : all my apprehensions were buried in the 
thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy 
of human nature, which, though I had heard of often, \ [ r had SO near a view 

of before ; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my stomach grew 
sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disord 
my stomach ; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but 
c >uld not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the 
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile, as amazed, 
and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmo>t affection of my soul, and, with 
a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of tin- 
world where I was distinxui.Nhed from such dreadful creatures as these ; and that though 
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so manyc 
in it that 1 had still more to give thanks for ttian to complain of: and this, above all, 
that I had. even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of 
Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a felicity more than suffi 
equivalent to all the misery which I had sullen-d, <>r n.uld Miller. 

In ihi- frame of thankfnlne-s. 1 went home to my castle, and began to be much 
easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before : for I observed 
that these wretches nver came to this island in search of what they could get ; perhaps 
not seeking, not wanting, or not exacting, anything here ; and havii:^ often, no doubt, 
been up in tin- covered, woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose. I

knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of 
human creature there before ; and I might be eighteen yours more as entirely concealed 
as I was now, if I did not discover my>elf to them, which I Imd no manner of occasion 
to do ; it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless 
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I 
entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that 1 have 1,, , n Braking of. and 
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another tip. that I 
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two youta 
tar this : when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, 
my country-seat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods : nor did I 
look after this for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats ; for tlie aversion 
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing 
them as of seeing the devil himself, u<>r did 1 so much as go to look after my boat in all 
this time, but began rather to think of making me another; for I could not think of e\< r 
making anymore attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me. lest I should 
meet with some of those creatures at sea ; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen 
into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being di-r 
by these jieople, began to wear off my uneasiness about them ; and I began to live just 
in the same composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be 
Men by any of them ; and particularly, I was more cautious in firing my gun, lest any 
of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it ; and it was, therefore, a very good 
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that 1 had 
no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of 
them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before : so that for two } 
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without it ; 
and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them 
out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise 
furbished tip one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to 
put it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I w.-nt 
id, if you add to the former deseript ion of myself, the particular of two pistol^, and 
a great broad-sword hanging at my side in a belt, hut without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting these 

one, to be reduced to my former . -.\\\\\ sedate way of living. All these things tended 

to show me, more and more, how far my condition was from being miserable, compared 

to soi thers; nay, to many other particulars of life, which it might have pieced Coil 

to h;i\e made my lot. It put mo upon reflecting how little repining there would he 
among mankind at. any condition of life, if people would rather compare their condition 
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than bo always comparing th> m 
with those which are better, to assist their murmurings ami complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things which 1 want 
indeed, I thought that the frights I had been in aloiit these savage wretches ami the 
concern 1 had been in for my own preservation, had taken fV the dge of my invention 
for my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good de-ign, which I had once bent 
m.- thoughts upon, and that was to try if I could not m of my barley into 

then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, ami 
1 reproved myself often for the simplicity of it : for I presently saw there would be the

want of several things necessary to the musing my beer, that 
would ! impossible for me to supply; as, first, i-asks to ; in, whic-h 

tiling that, as I have observed already, I conld never compass ; no, though 
I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in a'temptinij it, but t

cruel, bloody entertainment ; ami, if possible, save the victim they should bring hither 
to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended t 
to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for 
the destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their 
coming hither any more : but all was abortive ; nothing could be possible, to tako 

t, unless I was to bo there to do it myself: and what could one man do among 
them, when perhaps there might be twentv or tliirtv of them together with their d iris, 
or their bows and arrows, with which they could .shoot as true to a mark as I could 
with my gun ? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made their fire, 
and putting in live or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, 
would consequently take lire, and blow up all that was near it : but as, in the first place, 
I mid In; unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within 

[tr.intity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain 

. when it might surprise them ; and, at best, that it would do little more than just 
blow the lire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them for 
the place : so I laid it aside ; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush 
in some convenient place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of 
their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps 
:iot ; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and 

my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This 
pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed 
of it, and sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep. I went so 
far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself several days to find out proper 
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went frequently 
to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while my mind was 
thus filled with thoughts of revenge and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to 
the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of tho 
barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length I 
found a phu-e in the side of the hill, where 1 was satisfied I might securely wait till I 

.my of their h.-ats coming; and might then, e\en before they would be ready to 
come on shop-, OOdTey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which 
there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely ; and there 1 might sit and 
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were 

'. >se together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or 
that I could fail wounding time or four of them at the first shot. In this place, then, 
I revived to fix my design; and accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my 
ordinary fowling-piece. The two mu.-kets I loaded with a brace- of sings each, and 
four or live smaller bullets, about the si/.e of pistol bullets; and the fowling-piece I 
loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest si/.e; I also loaded my pi 
with about four bullets each ; and in this posture, well pro\ ided wilh ammunition for a 

id and third charge, 1 prepared my .-elf for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the srhemo of my design, and in my imagination put it in 

rice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of ihe hill, which 

from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, i e,. if I could observe any 

upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over towards it; but I began 

to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or tlnve nmnths constantly kept my 

watch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that

this as a (rime ; it is not against their own consciences repr..vi:;i_', or their 1 
reproaching them ; they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit i 
d "fiance of Divine justice, as we do in almost all the >ins we commit. Thev think ii 
more a crime! to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; or to eat human 
lle.-h, than we do to eat mutton." 

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly in the 
wronir in it; that these people were not murderer--, in the sm-e that F had before con- 
demnel them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who often 
put to death tho prisoners taken in battle ; or more frequently, upon many - 
put whole troops of men to the sword, without X' v ' n n quai-trr, though they threw 
down their arms, and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the 
usaj^e they i,'ave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothii 
me. These people had done me no injury; that if they attempt, d m -. or I >aw it 
sai-v, for mv immediate preservation, to fall np:>n them, something mi^'ht, be said for 
it : but that I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowle l^e of me, ami 

'i|uently no design upon me ; and, therefore, it could not be just for me to fill n 
them. That this would justily th;! conduct of the Sp-iniards in all their barbai 
p!-aetisrd in A merica, where they destroyed millions of tlioe people j who, lnv. . 
the\- were idolators and barbai'ians, and had several blood v and l)arbarous ritt.s in their 
ciisto'.ns, such as sacrificing, human bodies to their id<-ls, were yet, as to the Spaniards, 
very innocent people; and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with 
the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards tln-ms, -Ives. at this time, 
and by all other Christian nations in Kurope, as a mere butchery, a .bloody and unnatural 
pi. -ce of cruelty, unjustifiable eitlr-r to (Jod or man ; and such as for which the very name 
of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity or of 
Christian compassion ; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularlv miuent for the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



product of a race of men who were without principl i< -mess, or the 

If of pitv to the miserable, which is reckoned to I-*,- a uuirk of a generous temper in 

the mind. ft 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full stop ; and I began, V 

by little and little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in fl 

my ivs.ilut .ck the savages ; and that it was not my business to meddle with ^ft 

them, unless they first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent : U 

but that if 1 wen- discovered and attacked by them, then 1 knew my duty. On the other Jj 

hand, I argued with myself that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but ^l 

entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for, unless I was sure to kill every one that not I 

only should be on shore at that time, but that shouM ever >me, on shore afterwards, if A 

but one of them escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they would f l 
come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only 
| UJKHI myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner of occasion 

I" pon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one r-j 

i other, to concern myself in this afi'.iir ; that my business was, by all possible 

means, to conceal myself from them, and not to Lave the least sign for them to guess :[ 
by that there were any living creatures upon the island I mean of human shape. 

'ii joined in with this pYudential resolution ; and I was convinced now, many n 
ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for }| 
the destruction of innocent creatures I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes J| 
they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them ; these were Y 
national punishments, to make a just retribution for national offences, and to bring M 
public judgment uj>on those who oilend in a public manner, by such ways as best $Y 
please God. This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satis- 
faction to me than that I had not been sullered to do a thing which I now saw so J 
much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I ^j 
had committed it ; and I gave most humble thanks, on my knees, to God, that He had rj! 
thus delivere 1 me from blood-guiltiness ; beseeching Him to grant me the protection of 
His providence, that 1 might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might /* 
not lay my hands upon them, unless 1 had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in m 
d. -f.-nee of my own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far was I from n 

Mg an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I never once JM 

went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether ijj 

any of them had been on shore there or not, that T might not bo templed to renew ;my jjj 

of my contrivances again-t them, or be provohed by any advantage that might J 

t itself, to fall upon them: only this I did ; I went and ivmov. d my boat, VL 

whieh I had on the other side of the island, and earned it d .\vn to the east end of W 

the whole Maud, where I ran it into a little cove, whieh I found under .^.mi- high 

and whei.- I knew, by reason of the currents, the sav.i not, ut, 1 

wonM not, come with their boats upon any account whatever. With my b...it I < mi.,1 \L 

a\v:iy everything that I had left there belonging to her, though v for the fl 

thither, viz., a mast and sail which 1 had m:.de f,,r h r, and a thing like an M 

anchor, but which indeed could not be called either anchor or grapnel ; however, it was /Vw 

the be.t I could makj of its kind : all these I removed, that then- might not be the til 

hadow fur discovery, or any appearance of any 1 :' any habitation upon K! 

the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said more retired than ever, and seldom A

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



' went from my evil, except upon my constant employment, viz., to milk my she goats, 
\ and manage my little flock in the wood, which, ns it was quite on the other part of the 
island, was nut of danger ; for certain it is that these savage people who sometimes 
haunted tliis island, never eame with any thoughts of finding anything here, and 
c >ns--quently ii'-ver wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not hut they might ha\ 
been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, 
as well as before. Indeed, I looked hack with some horror upon the thoughts of what 
my condition would have been, if I had chopped ujxm them and born discovered 
iv that ; when, naked, and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often 
only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island t 
what 1 could get; what a surprise should I ha\e been in, if, when I discovered the 
print of a man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found 
th.iu pursuing me, and by the swiftness of tin ir running, no possibility of my 
escaping them ! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and 
distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should 
have done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even 
should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done ; much 
Ali-it now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might lie able to do. 
Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be very melancholy, and, 
sometimes, it would last a great while; but I resolved it all, at, last, into thank- 
fulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and 
had kept me i'mm those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in 
delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such thing depend- 
ing, or the least supposition of its being possible. 

This renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in former 
times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers 
we run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know 
nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a doubt or hesitation 
whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we 
intended to go that way : nay, when sens" "iir own inclination, and perhaps business, 
has called us to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from 
we know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us to 
go this way; and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that wav whieh \\ e 
should have gone, and even to our imagination ought, to ha\e gone, we should ! 
been ruined and lost, Upon the>e, and many like reflections, I afterwards made I 
it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found tl . t hints or prc->ii> L 

mind, to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going this way or thi:t way, 
I never failed to obey il.e secret dictate; though I knew m> other reason Cor it 
than that. su-li a pn->uiv, or sir h a hint, hung u] on my mind. I could give many 
examples of the success of this conduct ill tl)C coin>eof my life, but more especiallv 
in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy i.-land : besides many o.-.asjons 
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen A\iih the 

then that I see with now. Hut. it i Oarer tOO Iftte I" be \\i : and I cannot 
but advise all considering men, whose lives are atl.-nded with such extraordi; 
incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret ' 
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they will. 

1 shall not di-russ, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his will, as we 

nd ga-ping for lift-, and -lying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a little t.i 

t I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to rai>e himself; 

and I thought with myself lie might even lie there; for if he had frightened me, so 

he would certainly fright any of the savag.-s if any one of them should be so hardy 

as to come in there while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I found 
the ca\e \\.i- but very small, that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in 
no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever been employed in 
making it but those of mere Nature. I observed also that there was a place at the far- 
ther >ide of it that went in farther, but was so low that it required me to creep upon 
my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no 
candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to come again the next day provided 
with eandles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets with 
some wildfire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day 1 eame provided with six largo eandles of my own making 
(for I made very good candles now of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle- wiek, 

Dj sometimes rag-; or rope yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed likenettl 
and going into this low place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours, as I have s-iid, almost 
t.-n yards which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I 
knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the 
. 1 found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such 
a glorious sight seen in the island, T dare say, as it was to look round the s : d^ and roof 
of this vault or cave ; the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two 
e >ndl.-. What it was in the rock whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or 
gold which I rather supposed it to be I knew not. The place I was in was a most 
delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level ami had 
a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous crea- 
ture to \>,> >erii, m-ith.-r w.i> there any damp or wet on the side- <u roof; the only dilli- 
eulty in it was the entrance which, however, as it was a pla-v of security, and such a 
retreat as I wanted, I thought was a convenience so that I was really rejoiced at the 
M-ry. and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which 1 wai 
about to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine 
of powder, and all my >pare arms ; vix., two fowling pieces tor I had three in all 
and three muskets for of them T had eight in all; so I kept in my castle only live, 
which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost defence, and 
ready also to take out upon any expedition. I'p" 11 t' 1 '^ "ecasion of removing my 
ammunition. I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, 
and which had been W et, and I found that the water had penetrated alx.ut three or four 
inches into tho powder on every side, whieh caking and growing hard, had preserved 
the inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder 
in the centre of the ea-k : and thi i \ 'agreeable discovery t o me at that tim 

I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me 
in my eaMle, f..r fear of a urpri-e of any kind ; I also carried thither all the lead I had 

M-ied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live in 
an 1 holes in the rocks where none could come at them ; for I per-uaded myself, while 
I was lii-re. that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never lind me out

moment, till T had laiil me down and died, like the old goat in the MW I had al-o 

arrived t-> some little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass more 

pleasantlv with me a great deal than it did before : first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted 

before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it 

was very pleasant tome, and lie lived with me no less than six ami-twenty years. How 

lie mi;ht have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in 

i ': a/ils that they live a hundred years. IVrhups some of my Pols may be alive there 

still, calling after poor Robinson Crusoe to this day : I wish no Englishman the ill-luck 

ue there and hear them; but if he did he would certainly believe it was the devil. 

as a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my 

. and then died of mere old age. As for my rat*, tiny multiplied, as I have observed. 

to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from 

devouring me ami all I had ; but, at length, when the old ones I brought with me were 

gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no 

provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which 

I k. nd whose young, when they had any, I always drowned ; and these were 

f my family. P>esides these I always kept two or three household kids about me. 

whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which talked 

pretty well, and would all call "Robin Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, in 

did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had al.-o se\eral 

fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their 

wind's; and the little stakes which I had planted before my castle- wall being now grown 

up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there. 

h was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to l.e very well 

i with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the dread of the Bai 
it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet 
with my story to make this just ob>ervation from it: viz., how frequently, in the course 
1C evil which iu itself \\ e seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen 
. is the mo.- 1 dieidful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, 
by which alone we can be raised again from the alHiction we are fallen into. I could 
tmples of this in the course of my unaccountable life, but in nothing 
it more particularly remarkable than iu the circumstances of my last years of 
solitary re.-idenee in this i>land. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third year : and 
thi-, bein._r tli- southern solstice (for winter 1 cannot call in, was the particular time of 
my harve.-t, and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, g<>ing 
out pretty early in the morning, even before it wBfl thorough daylight, I was surprised 
with seeing a light of some fin; upon the shon . i.ince from me of about two 

mile.-, toward- the end of the i-land where I had ob.-crvrd some BftVftget had been, as 
id not on the other side, but, to my great atlliction, it was on my side of 
the island. 

[ wa.- indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, imf 
daring to go out. lest I might, be surprised ; and yet I had no more peace within, from 
fie ap prehensions I had that if tie . in rambling over the i-land, should find 

my o 'ii .-fanding or rut, or any of my works and improvement-, t|,,,y w ,.nld immediately 
iude that there wen- people in the place, and would then never rest till they had 
found me out In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the 
ladder alter me, having made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.

!uit the expectation of evil is more bitter than tin- MiiK-rim:. especially it 
is no room to shake <>(f that .-\- jactation or those apprehensions. 

During nil this tiimj I was iu the murdering humour, and sjient most of my hours, 
which should have been Iwtter employed, in r.mtri\ ing how to circumvent and fall upon

were the last time, into two parties; nor did I con-ider at all that if I killed HIM' party 
suppose ten or a dozen I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, 
and so another, even ad in/in itum, till 1 should be, at length, no less a murderer than they 
were in being man-eater* and perliaps much more so. I spent my days now in great 
perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall into the 
'/and* of these merciless creatures ; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not 
without looking around me with the greatev 1 caution imaginable. And now I 

found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame ll..rk or herd 
of goats ; for I durst not upon any account tire my gun, especially near that side of the 

I where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had lied 
from me now, I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hui 
canoes with them iu a few days, and then I knew what to expect. However, I 
out a year and three months more before I ny more of the savages, and then 1 

found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there once 
or twice, but either they made no stay, or at least I did not hear them ; but, in the 
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-aud-tweutieth year, I had a 
very strange encounter with them ; of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months interval was 
very great ; I .slept uiKpiietly, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out 
f my sleep in the night. In the day, great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; and in 

.iirht. I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify 

ioing of it. Hut to waive all this for awhile. It was in the middle tin- 

sixteenth day, I think, a.s well as my poor wooden calender would reckon, for 1 marked 
nil u|>on the post still ; I say, it was on the .sixteenth of May that, it blew a very great 
storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night

reading in the JJible, and taken up with :ons thought^ an-mt my present mdi- 

tion, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, liivd at MIL Tlin \\ 
be sure, a surprise of A quite different nature from any I had met with before ; for the 
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind. 1 started up in

help them, it might be they might help me ; so I brought together all the dry \vo,,l I 

1 get at hand, and. making a good handsome pile. I lire upon the hill. 

The wood was dry, and bla/ed freely ; and though the wind blew \erv hard, vet it 
burned fairly out, so that I was certain, if there wax any such thing as a ship, thev must

I all night lung, till daybreak ; and when it was broad .lay, and tin- air cleared up. I siw 

Bonn-thing at a great distance at sea, lull east of the i.-land, whether a sail or a hull I

to 1..- sa'i-'ied. 1 took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of the island, 
to the rocks where 1 had formerly been carried away with the current : and getting uj 
tin-re, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to mv great 
sorrow, the wreck of a ship, ca-t away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I 
found when 1 WM out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of 
the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my 
:u the must desperate, hopeless condition that ever J had been in in all 
my life. Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ; for it seems 
the^ men, whoever they were, heing out of their knowledge, and the rocks heing \\holly 
under water, had been driven upon them in the night, tin' wind blowing hard at K. 
and K.N.K. Had they seen the island, as I mil-' ily suppose they did not. they 

mu-t. as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves Oil shore by the help of 
their boat; but their firingolf their guns for help, especially when t hey saw. as I imagined, 
my tire, tilled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing mv light, 
they might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured to make the shore; 
but that the >ca running very high, they might have been cast away. Other tim<- . I 
imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many wavs; 
rtieularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which manv times obliged men 
or take iu pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their 
own hand-. Other times, I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, 
who. upon the signals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them oil'. 
Other times. I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried 
irrent that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean ? 
where thru- was nothing but mi-ery and perishing ; ami that, perhaps, they might by 
this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.

which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very 
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart 
began to foil me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I 
should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or .-ight of tin- 
island again ; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should 
rise, I should be inevitably lost 

a thoughts so oppiv^ed my mind, that 1 began to give over my enterprise ; and 
having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon 

ing bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my 

. ge ; when as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the Hood 
came on; upon which, my going was impraetieable for so many hours. Upon this, 
ntly it occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could 
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide, or currents lay, when the Hood 
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expeet 
to be driven another way home, with the same rapidity of the currents. This thought 
was no sooner in my head than I ea^t my eve upon a little hill, which sulliciently oxer- 
looked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of (he em-rents, i.r H 

id which \\ay I was t<> guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the 
nt of ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the current of the 

i set in close by the shore of the north side ; and that I had nothing to do but to 
keep to the north of the island in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set out with 
the first of the tide ; and reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under the L 
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out to sea, full north, 
till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and whieh carried me 
at a great rate ; and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done 
before, so as to take from me all government of the boat ; but having a strong steerage 
with my paddle, I went, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than t\\o 
I niie up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at : the ship, which, by its building, 
immed in between two rocks : all the stern and quarter of her 
beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had 
run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board, that 
M to say, broken short oil'; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared 
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, 
yelped and cried ; and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to me : I 
took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him 
a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a 
fortnight in the snow ; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if 1 
would have let him, he would have burst himself. After this I went on board ; but the 
sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, 
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when 
tlje ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, 
that the men were not able to bear it, and were .strangled with the constant rushing in 
of the water, as much as if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was 
nothing left in the .ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were 
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy, I 
knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could 
see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believe

belonged to some of the seamen ; and I got two of them into the 
boat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been 
fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good 
voyage ; for, by what I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship 
had a great deal of wealth on board ; and, if I may guess from the course she 
steered, she must have boon bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata,

in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the Gnlf of 
.Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of 
no use, at that time, to anybody ; but what became of the crew I then knew not 

1 found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about twenty gallons, 
which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There were several muskets in the 
cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it ; as for the 
muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took 
a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a 
copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came 
\vav, the tide taginning to make home again; and the same evening, about an hour 
within night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I 
iiat night in the boat ; and in tin- morning I resolved to harbour what I had 
got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my ca.sile. After refreshing myself, I got 
all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found 
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at tin- 15ra/ils ; ami, in a word, not at all 
good ; but when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me : 
for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled 
with cordial waters, fine and very good ; the bottles held about three pints each, and 
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good snccades, or sweetmeats, so 
lied also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the 
same, which the water had spoiled. T found some very good shirts, which were very 
welcome to me ; and about a do/en and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured 
neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to \vi;><- 
my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found there 
three great bags of pieces of eight, which hold about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and 
in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or 
we Ig. - i.f g. .Id ; I supjto.se they might all weigh near a pound. In the other ehest, were 

clothes, but of little value ; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged lo the 
gunner's mate; though there was no po-.vder in if, except two pounds of fine glaznl 
powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their f.wling pieces on 
occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any u-e to me ; 
for as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; it was to me as the dirt under 
my feet, and I would have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and 
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for many y. 
1 1. id. indeed. g<>t two pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned 
men whom I ,-,-iw in the wreek, and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which 

very welcome to me ; but they were not like our English shoes, either for case or 
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in the seaman's chest 
al. nit fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold : I suppose this belonged to a poorer 
man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged 
this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which 1 had 
brought from our own ship ; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of 
this ship had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe 
several times over with money; which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have 
lain here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it. 

I i -\ ing now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went back to my 
boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where 1 laid her 
np, and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything safe

unlucky head, that was always to lot me know it was born to make my body miserable, 
was all these two years filled with project*) aud designs, how, if it were poatiible, I might 
get away from this inland; for s.. m. times I was for making another voyage to

of my voyage ; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometime* another ; and I believe 
u rily, if 1 ha. I had the boat that I went from Sal lee in, I should have ventured to sea,'

so as to sleep ; 110, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows : It is impossible 
and needless to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that 
great thoroughfare of the brain the memory, in this night's time : I ran over the 
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming 
to this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to this island. In my 
reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was 
com]>aring the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here, with 
the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print 
of a foot in the sand ; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island 
even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore 
there ; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it ; 
my satisfaction was j>erfect, though my danger was the same, and I was as happy in 
not knowing my danger as if I had never really been exposed to it. This furnished 
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particularly this one : How 
infinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its government of mankind, 
such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things ; and though he walks in the 
midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would 
di- tract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events 
of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect seriously 
upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this very island, and how I 
had walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, even when 
perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, 
had been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into the 
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I 
would on a goat or a turtle ; and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me 
than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I 
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I 
acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown deliverances were due, and 
without which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in considering 
tin- nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to pass in 
the world, that the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his creatures to 
such inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even brutality itself, as to devour 
its own kind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred 
to me to inquire, what part of the world these wretches lived in ? how far off the D 
W:IN from whence they came? what they ventured over so far from home for] what 
kind of boats they had ? and why I might not order myself and my business so, that 
I might be as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me. 

I never go much as troubled myself to consider what I .should do with myself when 
I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the hands of tin ; or 
how I should escape them if they attacked me ; no, nor so much as h>\v it was possible 
for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, without 
any possibility of delivering myself: and if I should not fall into their hands, what 
I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my course : none of these thoughts, 
I. say, so much as came in my way ; but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of 
my imaging over in my boat to the main land. I looked upon my present condition as 
the inobt miserable that could possibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself into i

anything but death, that could be called worse ; and if I reached the shore of the main, 
J nii;ht j>erhaps meet with ivlief, or I might eoiust along, as I did on the African shore, 
till 1 s,,me inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and, after 

all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in; and if the 
worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries 
at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, 
made, as it were, desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and the disappoint- 
ments I had met with in the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so 
near the obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, namely, somebody to speak to, and 
to learn some knowledge of the place where I was, and of the probable means of my 
deliverance. I say I was agitated wholly by these thoughts ; all my calm of mind, in 
my retaliation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed 
to be suspended ; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to anything but 
the project >f a voyage to the main, which came upon me with such force, and such an 
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such violence 
that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if I had been in a l 
merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been 
Mnl exhausted with the very thoughts of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One 
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything 
ing to it : but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual, from 
my e istle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and 
that they brought with them another savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to 
ini ; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and 
ran for his life j then I thought* in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick 
grove before my fortification, to hide- himself ; and that I, seeing him alone, and not 
]>erceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling 
upon him, encouraged him : that lie kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist 
him ; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up it, and earned him int.. inv 
cave, and he became my servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to 
It", "Now I may certainly venture to the main land, tor this fellow will serve me 
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, ;in ,l \\-Jiither 
not to go for fear of being devoured ; what, places to venture into, and what to escape." 
I waked with this thought ; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the 
pr.. -pert of ni\ my dream, that the disappoint meiits \\hieh 1 felt upon coming 

to myself, and finding that it was no m,>re than a dream, were equally extravagant the 
other way, and thn-u- up- into a good dejection of .spirits. 

U|K>n this, however, I made this conclusion ; that my only way to go about an attempt 
MI escape was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession ; and, if possible, 
it should IK; one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should 
bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this ditliculty, that it 
was impossible to effect this without attacking & whole caravan of them, and killing 
them nil; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, 
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled tho lawfulness of it to me ; and my heart 
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance, 
d not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being tho same 
mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now viz., that those men 
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could ; that it was self-

and avoid being wen by them, mow eager to be upon them, i:

this affair; but nothing still presented; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, 
IV : .-ame ne.ir me for a great while. 

it a year ami a half after I entertained ih -e notions (and by \\\^ n. 

Ived tlie-m all into nothing, for \vant of an occasion to put them i 

tion), I was mirprUed one im rising t-arly ly seeing no less than five canoes all on shore 

heron my side tin- island, and the, people who belonged to them all landed and 

out of my H.u'ht. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and 

knowing that tln-y always came four or six, or I >uld not 

tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men 

.'-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put 

If into all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was 
just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening 
t.. In-ar it they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the 
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as n.* 
standing so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could 

i n eive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, 
that they \\rc no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that 
th.y had meat dressed. How they had cooked it, I knew not, or what it was ; but they 
were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own 
way, round the lire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspc' rable 

wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now 
brought, out for the slaughter. I j>erceived one of them immediately fall; being 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



knocked down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for that was their way ; and 
two or three others were at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while 
the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should bo ready for him. In 
that very moment, this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound, 
Nature inspired him with hopes of life and he started away from them, and ran with 
incredible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me ; I menu, towards that part of 
the coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, that I must acknowledge, 
when I perceived him run my way ; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him 
pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that part of my dream was coming to 
pass, and that ho would certainly take shelter in my grove : but I could not depend, by 
any means, upon my dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and 
find him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I 
found that there was not above three men that followed him ; and still more was I 
encouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained 
ground on them ; so that, if lie could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he 
would fairly get away IV. mi them all 

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned often in the 
first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw 
plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there ; but 
when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then 
up ; but, plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and 
ran with exceeding strength and swiftness. "When the three persons came to the creek, 
I found that two of them could swim, bat the third could not, and that, standing on the 
other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon after went softly back 
again ; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the 
two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek than the 
fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upo:i my thoughts, and indeed 
istibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or 
assistant ; and that I was plainly called by Providence to save this poor creature's life. 
I immediately i i dwu the ladder with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, 
for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I observed before, and getting up again 
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea ; and having a 
very short cut, and all down hill, clap'd myself in the way between the pursuers and 
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as 
much frightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back ; 
and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed ; then ru.shin^ 
at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I was 
loth to fire, because I would not have the rest hear ; though, at that distance, it would 
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not 
have known what to make of it Having knocked this fdj.iw down, the other who 
pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards him : but 
as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to 
shoot at me : so I was then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him 
at the first shot The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his 
enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise 
of my piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward IXT went backward, 
though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on. I hallooed again to him, 
and made signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way ;

then stopped again, and then a little farther, arid stopped 

: and I could then perceive that ho stood trembling, as if he 
had been taken prisoner, and had just been to bo killed, as his two 
cneniii -s were. I beckoned to him again to como to me, and gave him all 
the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and 
nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledg- 
ment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, an ' 
to him to come still nearer ; at length, he came close to me ; and then he kneeled 
down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and, taking 
me bv the foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swear- 
> be my slave for ever. I took him up and made much of him, and 
eneoura-_'ed him all I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I 

1 the savage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with 
the blow, and begnn to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him 
the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to in- 
tJiough T could not underst-ind them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear: 
lor they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own exrepted. 
for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for such reflections 
now ; the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as 

sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to 
be afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the 
man, as if I would shoot him; upon this, my savage, for so I call 
him nmv, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which 
hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no 
sooner had it. hut he runs to his enemy, and at one blow

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 






' cut off liis liead as cleverly, no executioner in (in-many could have <I,.IH> it sooner 
or bettor; which I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never 
saw a sword in his life 1 a- fore, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I 
, learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is 
I so hard, that they will even cut off heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one 
blow too When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and 
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand, 
laid it down, "with the head of the savage that he had killed just before me. But that 
which astonished him most, was to know how I killed the other Indian so far off; so 
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him ; and I bade him go, as well 
as I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning 
him first on one side, then oft the other; looked at the wound the bullet had made, 
which it M-ems was just in his breast, where it had made a li<>]e, and no great quantity 
of blood had followed ; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took np 
his bow and arrows, and c:ime back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to 
follow me, making signs to him that more might come after them. 

Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might 
not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do .so. 
He fell to work ; and in an instant he had scraped ahole in the sand with his hand-. IHL: 
enough to bury tin; first in, and then dragged him into it, and CON ered him ; and did BO by 
the other also ; I believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling 
him away, T carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther part 
of the island ; so I did not let my dream come to pass in that part, that he came into 
my grove for shelter. Here 1 gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a 
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for from his running ; 
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing 
him a place where I had laid some rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to 
p up-ill myself sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight, strong limbs, 
not too largo, tall and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. 
II- 1 had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have 
something verv manlv in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a 
Kuropejin in h is countenance, too, especially when he smiled. His hair wa- long and 
l'la-k, not curled like, wool ; his forehead very high and large ; and a great vivacity and 
sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not -quite black, but verv 
tawny ; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Lra/ilians and Virginians, and 
other natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in ii 
something \ cry agreeable, though not \ cry easy to describe. His ; loundand 

plump ; his nose small, not flat like the Negroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his 
line teeth well set, and as white as ivorv. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour, he awoke again, and 
ramo out of the cave to me; for I had be.-n milking m \hich I had in the 

iiK losurc just by : -when he espied me, ho eamo running to me, laying himself do\\ n 
again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, thankful disposition, 
making a great many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the 
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done before ; 
and atter this, made all the signs to mo of subjection, servitude, and submission 
imaginable, to let me know how IK* would serve me so long as ho lived. I under

alteration, fitted him very well ; and then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as 
my skill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor) ; and I gave him a 
cap which I made of hare'* skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough ; and thus he 
was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself 
almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at 
first ; wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat 
galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms but a little easing them where ho 
complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to them very 
well 

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to consider 
where I should lodge him ; and, that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy 
myself, I made a little tent, for him in the vacant place botween my two fortifications, 
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first. As there was a door 
or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it 
of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; and, causing the 
door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too ; so 
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without 
making so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken me ; for my first wall 
had now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to 
the side of the hill ; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, an I 
then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which wat strong, like iv 
and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by tho ladder, I had placed a 
kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have 
opcued at all, but wouU have fallen down and made a great noise : as to weapons, I 
took them all into my side every night But I needed none of all this precaution ; for 
never man liad a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without 
passions, sullen nesn, or designs, perfectly obliged and engird ; his very alleetions wen- 
tied to me, like those of a child to a father ; and I dare say ho would have sacrificed his 
life for the saving mine, UJHUI any occasion wliatsoever : the many testimonies he gave 
me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced mo that I needed no precautions 
for my safety on his account 

t"re.|uently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that however it 
M yitiifi 1 God in his providence, and in the government of the works of his hands, to 
take from so great a ]art of the world of his creatures the beat uses to whieh their 
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that ho 1 d u;>n th.-.u

and obligation; the same passions an 1 r- nhnents of wrongs; the saiie sense of

that he has given to us ; ami that when h" j.!- ise,s to offer them oc f exerting

and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding ; and why it has p! 
God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might 
judge by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than wo did. From 
hener, I sometimes was led too far, to invado the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it 
.were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



sight from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from Kuih ; hut I 
shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion : first, That we did not know 
by what light and la\v these should In- condemned ; but that as (Jo. I was neeessai -ily, 
and, by the nature of liis b"ing, infinitely holy ami just, so it could not be, but it' the-e 

tared were all s"ntnced to absence fi-om himself, it was on account of sinning 
against that light, which, as th ; Scripture si\-, \\.is a law to themselves, and by such 
rales as their consciences \vou-ld acknowledge to be ju<t, though the foundation was not 
discovered to u; and, secondly, That still, as we are all tin- clay in the hand of the 
Potter, no vessel could say to Him, " Why ha-t tlnm formed mo thus ?" 

JJut to return to my now companion : 1 was greatly delighted with him, and made 
it my business to teach him e\er\ thing that was pmper to mala; him useful, handy, and 
helpful; but especially to make him speak, and understand me when I spoke; and he 
was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was BO merry, so constantly 
diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make me understand 
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began to be so 
easy that I began to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more s;i . .._ I 
caret I not if I was never to remove from the place while I lived. 

: I had 1 11 two or three days returned to my ea>tle, I thought that, in order 

to bring Friday oil' from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's 
stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning 
to the wools. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it 
home and dress it ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and 
two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday; "Hold," said I, "stand 
still ; " and made signs to him not to stir : imm -diately I presented my piece, shot, and 
killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill 
the sa\a-e, his enemy, but did not know nor could imagine how it wa* done, was 
sensibly surprised ; trembled, and shook, and looked so ama/ed that I thought he would 
have sunk down. He did not sec. the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but 
ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded ; ami. as I found presently, 
thought I was resolved to kill him : for If came and kneeled down to me, and embracing 
my knees, said a great many things 1 did not understand ; but I could easily see the 
meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. 

! ..n found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm ; and taking him 
up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned 
to him to run and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wondering, and looking to 
6 how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again. I'.v-and-by I saw a great 
fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree within shot ; so, to let, Friday understand a little 
what 1 would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a 
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my 
gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see 1 would make it fall, 1 made 
him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird ; accordingly, I tire. I, and bade 
him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, 
notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and I found he iNf the more ama/.< d, because 
he diil not see me put anything into the gun, but thought that tin-re must be 
wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, 
or anything near or far oil'; and the. astonishment this created in him was such as e.uihl 
not wear otl' for a long time ; and, I believe, if I would have let him, he would 
worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much 

14- 




I '.I.' ' >M l..s I'M. I I I 



touch it for several days after ; but he would . it and talk to it. a-* if 

answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I at hi,,,, waa to 

desire it not to kill him. Well, after his aMoni>|,mei,i was a little over at this, 
I pointed to him to run and fetch tho bird I had shot, which he did, but 
time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance from tin- 
place where she fell : however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and 
as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge 
the gun again, and to let him see me do it, that I migl. ny oth,-r ; 

might present ; but nothing more offered at that time : HO I brought home the kid. 
the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and ha. 
fit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the ilexh. and made some very good 
broth. After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad 
of it, and liked it very well ; but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat 
salt with it. He made a sign to .me that the salt was not good to eat ; and putting a 
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and .-putter at it, 
washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some 
into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of Halt, as 
fast as he had done at the salt; but it would not do ; he would neve: salt 

with his meat, or in his broth ; at least, not for a great while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast him tin- 
next day with roasting a piece of the kid : ; this I did by hanging it before, the fire on a 
string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, one on 
side of the fire, and one across on the top, and tying the string to the cross .stick, ) 
the meat turn continually. This Friday admired very much ; but when he came to 
taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not 
but understand him : and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would n \er eat 
man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting it in the 
manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he soon understood how to do it a> \\ell 
as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it \\a> to make 
bread of; for after that, I let him see me make my bread, and bake it, t..,, ; and 
in a little time, Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well a- I c.mld d" it 
myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one, I must 
provide more ground for iny harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to 
do ; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
before, in which Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but did ii \.-ry 
cheerfully : and I told him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more 1.. 
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too. 
He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought 1 had much 
more labour upon me -on his account, than I had for myself; and that he would work 
the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasant t'st year of all the life I led in this place. Friday be^an 1-. 
talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost everything I had occasion to call 
for, and of every place I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to me ; so that, in short 
I began now to have some iise for. my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little 
occasion for before ; that is to say about speech. J'.esides the pleasure of talking to him, 
1 had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself : his simple, unfeigned homely appeared

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



to me more and more erery day, and I began really to love the creature ; and on his side 
I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love anything before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his own country 
again ; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me almost any 
question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle. 
At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always fight the better ; " that is, lie meant, 
always get the better in fight ; and so we began the following discourse : 

Muter. You always fight the better; how came you to be taken prisoner tin MI, 
Friday! 

Friday. My nation beat much, for all that. 

M'uttfr. How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken 1 

Friday. They more many than my nation, in the place where me was ; they take 
one, two, three, and me : my nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where me no 
was ; there my nation take one, two, great thousand. 

Matter. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your ennui. -s 
then f 

Friday. They run, one, two, three, and me, and make me go in the canoe ; my 
nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they take ? Do 
they carry them away and eat them, as these did ? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too : eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Matter. Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place. 

Matter. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. Yes, I been here (points to the N.W. pidc of the island, which, it seems 
was their side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the savages 
who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on the said man-eating 
occasions that he was now brought for : and, some time after, when I took the courage 
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the 
place, and told me he was there once, when they eat up twenty men, two women, and 
one child : he could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by laying so 
many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows; that after tliis discourse 
I had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether 
the canoes were not often lost He told me there was no danger, no canoes ener 1 < ; 
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a. current and wind, always one way in 

UM morning tl th.-r in tin- afternoon. This I underwood ti- lie no more ilian the 

eta of the tide, a* going nut or coinjnir in; lnt I afterwards understood it was occa- 
sioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth of 
which river, as I thought afterwards, our island lay ; and that this land which I perceived 
to the W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth 
of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions alx>ut the country, the inhabitants, 
the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he knew, with the 
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several n iftiom f his sort 
of people, but could get no other name than Carilw : from when- < 1 < i ily and : 






'^ 



that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America which 
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. 
He told me, that up a great way beyond the moon (that was, beyond the setting of the 
moon, which must be west from their country), there dwelt white-bearded men, like UK-, 
and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed 
much mans, that was his word : by all which I understood ho meant the Spaniards, 
whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, and were remem- 
bered by all the nations from father to son. 

HS 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this island, and get among 
those white men : he told me, " Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe." I could not 
understand what he meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he 
meant it must be in a large, great boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Friday's 
discourse began to relish with me very well ; and from this time I entertained some 
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from 
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it 

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he began to 
speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious 
knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked him one time wh'o made him. The poor 
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked him who was his father : 
but I took it by another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we 
walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, "It was one Benamuckee, that lived 
beyond all;" he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, 
" much older," he said, " than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars." I asked 
him then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all things worship him ? 
He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, " All things said ! 
to him." I asked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere. He 
said, "Yes; they all went to Benamuckea" Then I asked him whether those they eat 
up went thither too. He said, " Yes." 

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true God : I 
told him that the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up towards heaven ; 
that he governed the world by the same power and providence by which lie made it ; 
that he was omnipotent, and could do everything for us, give everything to us, take 
everything from us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with givit 
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem 
us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to hoar us, 
even into heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the 
sun, ho must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way 
off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to 
speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him. He said, " No ; 
they never went that were young men ; none went thither but the old men," whom he 
railed their Oowokakee ; that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or 
clergy ; and that they went to say O ! (so he called saying prayers) and then came back 
and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is priestcraft 
even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world ; and the policy of making 
a secret of religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not 
only to be found in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even 
among the most brutish and barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and told him that tho pre- 
tence of their old men going up to the mountains to say 1 to their god Benamuckee 
was a cheat ; and their bringing word from thence what he said was much more so ; that 
if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit ; 
and then I entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his 
rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the 
dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and tlie many 
stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin ; how he had a secret access 
to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as 

146 ,1 



FRIDAY RECEIVES RELIGIOUS 1 N Yi RUCTION. 



to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run upon our own destruction by our 

own choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in 1m mind about the devil as it 
was about the being of a God : nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even 
tho necessity of a great First Cause an overruling, governing Power a secret directing 
Providence ; and of the equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and 
the like : but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit; of hi* 
original, his being, his nature; and, above all, of his inclination t.xlo evil, :md t., draw 
us in to do so too: and the poor creature pu/./h-d me once in such a manner, by a 
question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I h;t<l 
been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, His omiiipottMiri', His avrr.-i.n 
to sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as Ho liad made us 
all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment ; and he listened with great 
seriousness to me all the while. After this, I had been telling him how the devil was 
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good 
designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like. 
" Well," says Friday ; " but you say God is so strong, so great ; is he not much strong, 
much might as the devil ? " " Yes, yes," says I, " Friday ; God is stronger than the 
devil : God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under 
our feet, and to enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts." " But," 
says he again, "if God much strong, much might as the devil, why God no kill the 
devil, so make him no more do wicked ? " I was strangely surprised at this question ; 
and after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill quali- 
fied for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties ; and at first I could not tell what to say; 
so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said ; but he was too earnest for 
an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words 
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, "God will at last 
punish him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and he is to be cast into the 
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday ; but he 
returns upon me, repeating my own words, "'Iteserve at last! ' me no understand : but 
why not kill the devil now ; not kill great ago ? " " You may as well ask me," said I, 
" why God does not kill you or me, when we do wicked things here that offend Him : 
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He muses awhile on this : " Well, 
well," says he, mightily affectionately, " that well : so you, I, devil, all wicked, all 
preserve, repent, God pardon all." Here I was run down by him to the last degree : 
and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will guide 
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the 
supreme being of Gad, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but Divine revelation 
can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us ; of a 
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God's throne ; I 
say, nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul ; and that, therefore, 
the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the 
Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely 
necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the means 
of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man, rising up hastily 
as upon some sudden occasion of going out ; then sending him for something a good 
way off, I seriously prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this 

147 ^r.^--^.

; poor savage ; assisting by His Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive 

J the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to Himself, and would 

guide me to speak BO to him from the Word of God, that his conscience might be 

convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered 

| into a long discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour 

of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven viz., of repentance 

towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as well as 

I could why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature of angels, but the seed 

of Abraham ; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption ; 

that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the lika 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I took for this 
poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the 
same principle will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really informed and 
instructed myself in many things that I either did not know, or had not fully considered 
before, but which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for the 
information of this poor savage ; and I had more affection in my inquiry after things 
upon this occasion than ever I felt before : so that, whether this poor wild wretch was 
the better for me or no, I had reason to be thankful that ever he came to me ; my grief 
sat lighter upon me ; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure : and when 
I reflected that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had not only 1> -n 
moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek the hand that had brought me here, but 
was now to be made an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for auglit I 
know, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of 
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom is life eternal ; 
I say, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through every part of 
my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever 1 was brought to this place, which I had so 
often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me. 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my time ; and the conver- 
sation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such as made the three 
years which we lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any such tiling 
as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary state. This savage was now a good 
Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, 
that we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We had hero the 
Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to instruct, than if we had been 
in England. I always applied myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as 
well a-; I could, the meaning of what I read ; and he again, by his serious inquiries and 

i- minus made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture know! . 
than I should ever have been by my own mere private reading- Another thing I 
t refrain from observing here also, from experience in this retired part of my life 
viz., how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of 
the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God, 
so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me 
capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of 
sincere repentance for my sins, and of lay ing hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a 
1 refi.nnation in practice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this without any 
T or instructor, I III-MII human ; so the same plain instruction suHi.-iently serv.-d 
to the enlightening this s.iva^e creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I 
have known few equal to him in my life. ,

As to the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have happened in the world 
about religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church government, they were 
all perfectly useless to us, and, for aught I can yet see, they have been to the rest of the 
world. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz., the Word of God ; and we had, blessed be 
God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by His word, 
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the instruction of 
His word. And I cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed 

149 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



points of religion, which have made such confusions in the world, would have been to 
us, if we could have obtained it ; but I must go on with the historical part of things, 

and take every part in its order. 

i After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could und-r- 
i stand almost all I said to him, and sjxjak fluently, though iu broken English, to me, I 
acquainted him with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my coining 
into this place ; how I had lived there, and how long : I let him into the mystery, for 
such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him 
a knife, with which he was wonderfully delighted ; and I made him a belt, with a frog 
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a 
hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but 
much more useful upon many occasions. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, particularly England, which I came from . 
how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we 
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I 
had been on board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay : but 
she was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite gone. I showed him the ruins of 
our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole 
ngth then ; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday 
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied 
upon. At last, says he, " Me see such boat like come to place at my nation." I did 
not understand him a good while ; but, at last, when I had examined further into it, I 
understood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country 
where he lived ; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I 
presently imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon their coast, 
and the boat might get loose and drive ashore ; but was so dull that I never once 
thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might 
come : so I only inquired after the description of the boat. 

1'riday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought me better to understand 
1dm when he added with some warmth, " We save the white mans from drown." Then 
I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he called them, in the boat. " Yes," 
he said ; "the boat full of white mans." I asked him how many. He told upon his 
fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of them. Ho told me, " They live, 
they dwell at my nation." I 

Thi> put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently imagined that these might be \ 
tin- men In-longing to the ship that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now ' 
called it ; and who, after tin- ship was struck on the rock and they saw her inevitably 
lost, had saved themx-lvrs in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shoro among 
the savages. Upon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them. 
He assured me they lived still there ; that they had been there about four years ; that 
the savages left them alone, and gave them victuals to live. I asked him h.,w it 
came to pass that they did not kill them and eat them. He said, " No, they make brother 
with them ;" that is, as I understood him, a truce ; and then he added, " They no eat 
mans but when make the war fight ; " that is to say, they never eat any men but such ' 
as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle. A 

It was after this some considerable time, that l>ein^ upon the top of the hill, at the J 
east aide of the island, from whence, as I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the \ 
main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very J 

150 /) 



CRUSOE INDULGES IN GROUNDLESS JEALOUSY. 



earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and dan< 
and calls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what was the 
matter. " Oh, joy !" says he ; "oh, glad ! there see my country, tln-ro my nation ! " I 
observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, 
and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in hi 
own country again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which 
made me, at first, not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before ; and I made 
no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he would not only 
forget all his religion, but all his obligation tome, and would be forward enough to give 
his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of 
them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with 
those of his enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest 
creature very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy 
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar 
and kind to him as before : in which I was certainly in the wrong too ; the honest 
grateful creature having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best prin- 
ciples both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend ; as appeared afterwards to 
my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day pumping him, 
to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected were in him ; 
but I found everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing 
to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely 
his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could 
not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea, so that we 
could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself 
in your own country, your own nation 1 " " Yes," he said, " I be much O glad to be 
at my own nation." " What would you do there ? " said I : " would you turn wild 
again, eat men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you were before 1 " He looked full of 
concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no; Friday tell them to live good ; tell them 
to pray God ; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk ; no eat man again." " Why, 
then," said I to him, " they will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said, 
" No, no ; they no kill me, they willing love learn." He meant by this, they would be 
willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 
boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told 
me he could not swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe for him. He told me 
he would go, if I would go with him. " I go ! " says I ; " why they will eat me if I 
come there." " No, no," says he, " me make them no eat you ; me make them much 
love you." He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his 
life, and so lie would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how 
kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came 
on shore in distress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly 
join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese ; 
not doubting but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being 
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than I could from an island 
forty miles off the shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, T took Friday 
to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go back 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



to his own nation ; and, accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other 
side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water)> 
I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it I found he was a most 
dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift and fast again 
as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, " Well, now, Friday, shall we go to 
your nation ? " He looked very dull at my saying so ; which it seems was because he 
thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I had a bigger ; so the next 
day I went to the place where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I 
could not get into the water. He said that was big enough ; but then, as I had taken 
no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had split 
and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me that such a boat would do very well, 
and would carry " much enough vittle, drink, bread ; " that was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over with him 
to the continent, that I told him we would go and make one as big as that, and he 
should go home in it He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I 
asked him what was the matter with him. He asked me again, " Why you angry mad 
with Friday ? what me done ? " I asked him what he meant I told him I was not 
angry with him at all. " No angry ! " says he, repeating the words several times ; " why 
send Friday home away to my nation ? " " Why," says I, " Friday, did not you say 
you wished you were there ? " " Yes, yes," says he, " wish we both there ; no wish 
Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not think of going there without 
me. " I go there, Friday ? " says I ; " what shall I do there ? " He turned very quick 
upon me at this. " You do great deal much good," says he ; " you teach wild mans be 
good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new life." 
"Alas, Friday !" says I, " thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant 
man myself." " Yes, yes," says he, " you teachee me good, you teachee them good." 
" No, noj Friday," says I, " you shall go without me ; leave me here to live by myself, 
as I did before." He looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of the 
hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. " What must 
I do with this ? " says I to him. " You take kill Friday, ' says he. " What must I 
kill you for?" said I again. He returns very quick "What you send Friday away 
for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly that I .sw 
tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him 
to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would 
never send him away from me, if ho was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to me, and that 
nothing could part him from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his 
own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, ami his hopes of my doing 
them good ; a thing which, as i had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, 
or intention, or desire of undertaking it But still I found a strong inclination to my 
attempting an escape, founded on the supposition gathered from the former discourse, 
that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore, without any more delay,*! 
went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to f.-ll, ami miko a largo 
periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There wero trees enough in the island to 
have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good largo vessels ; but 
the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the wator that wo mijjht launch it 
whfii it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched 
upon a tree ; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



it ; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it 
was verv like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was 
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of 
this tree out, to make it into a boat, but I showed him how rather to cut it with tools ; 
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in about a month's 
hard labour, we finished it and made it very handsome ; especially, when, with our axes, 
which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape 
of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it 
were, inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water ; but when she was in, she would 
have carried twenty men with great ease. , 

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see with what 
dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her 
along. So I asked him if we would, and if we might venture over in her. " Yes," he 
said ; " we venture over in her very well, though great blow wind." However, I had a 
farther design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to 
fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get ; so I 
pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which there 
was great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave 
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular 
care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough ; but as I had had 
them now six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, 
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but 
they were all rotten ; and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two pieces^ 
which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of 
pains, and awkward, tedious stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length 
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton 
sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually 
our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage, because it was 
such a one as I used in the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related 
in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work viz., rigging and fitting my mast 
and sails ; for I finished them very complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail 
to it, to assist if we should turn to windward ; and, which was more than all, I tixed a 
rudder to the stern of her to steer with. And though I was but a bungling shipwright, 
yet as I knew the usefulness, and even the necessity of such a thing, I applied myself 
with so mueh pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass ; though, considering the 
many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much 
labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man I-Yiday to teach as to what belonged to the 
navigation of my boat ; for, though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe, In- knew 
nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder ; and was the most aina/ed when In- siw 
me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail giblu-d, ;md 
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; 1 say, when ho saw (his, 
In- stood like one astonished and ama/. -d. However, with a little use, I made all these 
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that as to the com] 
could make him understand very little of that On the other hand, as there was very 
little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the less 
occasion for the compass, seeing the stara were always to be seen by night, and the sli<, 



ANOTHER ARRIVAL OF CANOES 



by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad <-Lil,, -r l.v lau-l 
or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of ray captivity in 
though the three last years that I had this creature with inn ou-_:M i at K.-r to be left out 
of the account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of my 
timo. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness t<- ' 
for his mercies as at first : and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had 
much more so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over 
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had 
an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that 
I should not be another year in this place. However, I went on with my husbandry ; 
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did 
every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within doors 
than at other times. I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her 
up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; 
and hauling her up to the shore at high- water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little 
dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to 
float in ; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, 
to keep the water out ; and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea : and to keep the 
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as 
a house ; and thus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I 
designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design returned 
with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage. And the first thing I did 
was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage ; and 
intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I 
was busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid 
him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we 
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not 
been gone long when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like 
one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to 
speak to him, he cries out to rne, " master ! O master ! sorrow ! bad ! " 
" What's the matter, Friday ? " said I. " Oh ! yonder, there," says he 5 " one, two, three 
canoes ; one two, three ! " By this way of speaking, I concluded there were six ; but 
on inquiry I found there were but three. "Well, Friday," says I, "do not be 
frightened." So I heartened him up as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow 
was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come back to 
look for him, and would cut him in pieces and eat him ; and the poor fellow trembled 
so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and 
told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him. 
" But," said I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday ? " 
" Me shoot," says he ; " but there come many great number." " No matter for that," 
said I, again; "our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I aske.l him 
whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do judfi 
as I bid him. He said, " Me die, when you bid die, master." So I went and 
fetched a good dram of rum and gave him ; for I had been so good a husband of my 
rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I made him take the two 

155 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



fowling-pieces, wliich we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot, as big 

* as small pistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, 
and five small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each. 
I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet 

S When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went up to the side 
of the hill, to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly by my glass, that there 
were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; and that their whole 
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies ; a 
barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with 
them. I observed also that they landed, not where they had done when Friday made 
his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood 
came close almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these 
wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to Friday, 
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him if 
he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a little 
raised with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he 
would die when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury I took first and divided the arms which I had charged, as before, 
between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his 
shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three myself; and in this postur* 

* marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large 
bag with more powder and bullets ; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close 
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, aud in the mean- 
time not to speak a word. In this posture 1 fetched a compass to my right hand of 
near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come 

fc within shot of them before I should be discovered, which 1 had seen by my glass it was 
^ easy to do. 

r While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to 

L abate my resolution I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their number, 

I for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them nay, 
I though I had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, 

f much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people 

Ft who had neither done or intended me any wrong ? who, as to me, were innocent, and 

\ whose barbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's 

u having left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity, and 

K to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their 

ft actions, much less an executioner of His justice that whenever he thought fit He 

would take the cause into His own hands, and by national ven^eanee punish them 

for national crimes; but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business- -that it 

I was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in a state of 

war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them ; but 1 

A could not say the same with regard to myself. These things were so warmly pressed 

fl upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and i>lai-e 

II myself near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then 
I? as God should direct ; and that unless something offered that was more a call to me than 

yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them. 

k With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible wariness and silence, 

K) Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came to the skirt <>t' tin- wood on

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



the side which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and 
them. Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at 
the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could e 
there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came immediately back to me, and 
told me they might be plainly viewed there that they were all about their fire eating 
the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little 
from them, whom he said they would kill next ; and this fired the very soul within me. 
He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had 
told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the very 
naming of the white bearded man.; and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a 
white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with 
flags, or things like rushes, and that he was a European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to 
them than the place where I was, which, by going a little way about, I saw I might 
come at undiscovered, and that then I should be within half a shot of them ; so I 
withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; and going 
back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I cam.- 
to the other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of 
them at the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat upon the 
ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor 
Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they were stooping 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday ; " Now, Friday," said I, " do 
as I bid thee." Friday said he would. " Then, Friday," said I, " do exactly as you see 
me do ; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon 
the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim 
at the savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him if he was ready, he said, 
" Yes." " Then fire at them," said I ; and at the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he shot ho killed 
two of them, and wounded three more ; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two. 
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them that wero 
not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way to ran, or 
which way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday 
kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, ho might observe what I did ; so, as 
soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, 
and Friday did the like ; he saw mo cock and present ; he did the same again. " A re 
you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," says he. "Lot fly, then," said I, "in the name 
of God !" and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Frid iy; 
and as our pieces wero now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-Indicts, 
we found only two drop ; but so many were wounded, fchat they ran ah ml yelling and 
screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably wound' 1 ; 
\\ hereof three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

" Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up tho 
musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which he did with a d of courage ; 

U]ou -which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and I-Yiday close at my foot. 
As soon a* I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and hi h: Frid t; 
so too, and running as fast as I could, which by the way was not very fast, beini; 1 
with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying

.id put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and bad cut

thru), s.i tho poor creatures were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that 

11 down for mere amozem* nt and fear, and had no more power to attempt their 

own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot : and that was the case of those five 

i lut I-Yiday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, 

so tin- ether two fell with the fright 

I kept my pie.-e in my luiiid .still without firing, being willing to keep my charge 

. because I had gi\. n the Spaniard my pi>tol and sword; so I called to Friday, 

ami bailc him run up to the tree from wh. IK-.- we :irms which 

lay there that had br-n discharged, whirh h- di<l with great swiftness; and then giving

them, but the other was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, yet had 
plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two who were 
left in the canoe ; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not 
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands, of one-and-twenty. The 
account of the whole is as follows : Three killed at our first shot from the tree ; two 
killed at the next shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Friday, of 
those at first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three killed by the i 
Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by I 
Friday in his chase of them ; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not II 
dead twenty-one in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, and though Friday | 
made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday 
would fain have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them ; and, indeed, I was 1 
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they '! 
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by 11 
mere multitude ; so I consented to pursue them, by sea, and running to one of their 
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in the canoe, J 
I was surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the 1 
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was 
the matter ; for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was 
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really little life 
in him. * 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound him with, and 
would have helped him up ; but he could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, 
believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday 
came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance \ and pulling out 
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with the news of his being 
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him I 
speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen h\v 
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, 
danced, sung ; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head ; and then 
sung and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I 
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when he came a J 
little to himself, he told me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstacy and filial J 
affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and of his being I 
delivered from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagances of his affection 
after this j for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great many times : when I 
he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head 
close to his bosom half an hour together, to nourish it; tli"ii In- 1 > '< Ins ann- 
ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, an 1 oh*fftd and nibbed them with \ 
his hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to 
rub them with, which did them a great deal of good 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages, who were 
now gotten almost out of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew 
so hard within two hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of their way, and I 
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was against them 
that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that they e\vr reached their own coast. J

But to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father, that I could not find in 
my heart to take him off for some time ; but after I thought he could leave him a littlo 
I called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 
extreme ; then I asked him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head, 
and said, "None ; ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a cake of hn-ad, out of a 
little pouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for himself; but he would not 
taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of 
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his lather. lit- had no sooner given his 
father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been be- 
witched, for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at 
such arats that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I call< 

hallooed out too, after him, it was all one away he went ; and in a quarter of an

: hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went ; and, as he came nearer, 

t I found his pace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up to me, 

I foud he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some 

4 fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread : the bread he gave 

j me, but the water he carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took 

a little sup of it This water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had 

given him, for he was just fainting with thirst 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any water left : 
he said " Yes ;" and I bade him give to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want 
of it as his father ; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard 
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under 
the shade of a tree ; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with 
the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming to 
him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went 
to him and gave him a handful of raisins : he looked up in my face with all the tokens 
of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, 
notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon 
his feet : he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were 
so swelled and so painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his 
ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps less, all the 
while he was here, turned his head about, to see if his fatH^was in the same place 
posture as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which hr 
started up, and, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could 
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : but when he came, he only 
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me 
presently ; and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and 
1 -ad him to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take 
care of him. But Friday, a lusty young fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon Ins 
back, and earned him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side or 
gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it ; and then lifted him quite in, and 
set him close to his father ; and presently stepping out again, launched the boat oil', 
and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty 
hard too ; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, 
runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him, and a>ked him 
whither he went. He told me, " Go fetch more boat ; " so away he went like the wind, 
for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and he had the other canoe in the CM. < k 
almost as soon as I got to it by land ; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our 
new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but they were neither of them able to walk ; 
so that poor Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to bid them .-it 
down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them 
on, and Friday and I carried them up both together upon it between us. 

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we were at a 
worse loss than before,for it was impossible to get them over, and 1 was r< -solved nut to 
break it down ; so I set to work again, and I-'riday and I, in about two hours' time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with boughs of ti 
being in the space without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of young j

My island wai bow peopled, and I thought myself very rich in swbjr, was 

a merry reflection, which I fr.-,u-ntly made, how like a king I looked. Fiwt of all, the 
w hole country was my own ID :-ty, no that I h > ubUxi right of dominion. 

Secondly, my people wei , *ubjeet<-d : I wan aliwilutvlv lord and lawgiver : they 

all owed their live re ready to Uy down their lives, if there had been 

occasion t too, I had but three subjects, and they were 

of three different religion-* : my man Ki iday wan a Protestant, his father was a Pagan 
and a cannibal, ami t he Spaniard was a Papist However, I allowed liberty of conscience 
throuxh"iit my dominions : But this is by the way. 

\ soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them li 
and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some provUion for them ; 
and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a 
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed ; when I cut off the hinder quarter, and 
chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made 
them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice 
also into the broth ; and as I cooked it without-doors, for I made no fire within my inner 
wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat 
down, and ate my own (Tinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them 
and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, 
"to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I or lay to take one of the canoes 

and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of time, we had 
upon the place of battle ; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would presently bo offensive. 
I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, v. 
not think of doing myself: nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that way ; all 
which he punctually performed, and defaced the very appearance of the savages being 
there ; So that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by 
the corner of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects ; and, 
first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of the ravages 
in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them, with a power too great 
for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out 
the storm which blew that night they went off, but must, of necessity, be drowned, or 
driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were 
to be drowned if they were cast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe 
on shore, he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully 
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he 
believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by 
the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and I, were two heavenly 
spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This he said 
he knew, because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to anot 
it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and 
kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now : and this old savage was 
in the right ; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages nearer attempted to

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



go over to the island afterwards ; they were so terrified with the accounts given by those 
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that 
enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew 
not ; and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, ami kept alwavs 
upon my guard, I and all my army : for, as we were now four of us, I would have 
ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their coming wore 
off ; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into considerati* in ; 
1>< ing likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage from 
their nation, on his account, if I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended 
when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there 
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away and 
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars 
of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to 
the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and 
silver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there; that they 
had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck ; that five 
of their own men were drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped 
through infinite danger and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, 
where they expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me they had some 
arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, 
the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a little, which they used at 
their first landing, to provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had formed 
no design of making any escape. He said they had many consultations about it ; but 
that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils 
always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an escape ; and whether, if they were all 
here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery 
and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent 
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations 
they had received, so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it 
would be very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that they 
should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Kiiulishman was 
certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever brought him 
thither; and that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, 
than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be earned into the Iiu|iiisitinn. I 
added that, otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we mi-lit, with so many 
hands, build a barque large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils south- 
ward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward ; but that if, inrec|nital, they should, 
when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their own people, I 
might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before. 

Hi- answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their romlition 

miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor 

the thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance ; and 

that, it' I pleated, he would go to them, with the old man, and diseoui-. M - \\ith them about 

it and return again, and bring me their answer ; that he would make conditions with 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



them upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction, as their 
commander and daptain. ; and they should swear upon the holy sacrament and gospel, 
to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other ; 
and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in 
such country as I intended ; and that he would bring a contract from them, under their 
hands, for that purpose. Then he told me ho would first swear to me himself, that he 
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders ; and that he would 
take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach of 
faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, 
and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, 
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages ; out of all hopes of ever 
returning to their own country ; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, 
they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible, and to send 
the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when we had got all thinga 
in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not 
but be very well satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades 
for at least half a year. The case was thus / he had been with us now about a month, 
during which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assistance 
of Providence, for my support ; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had 
laid up ; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient, 
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four ; but much less 
would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive, should 
come over ; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if .we should 
build one, for a voyage f to any of the Christian colonies of America; so he told me he 
thought it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some 
more lancyas much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, 
that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come ; for 
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, 
otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. "You know," says he, "the children 
of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled 
even against God himself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the 
wilderness." 

His caution was so seasonable, arid his advice so good, that I could not but be very 
well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity ; so we fell to 
digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; 
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much 
land cured and trimmed up, as we sowed two-and- twenty bushels of barley on, and 
sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare ; indeed, we left 
ourselves barely sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our 
crop ; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for it-is 
not to be supposed it Is six months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us out of fear of 
the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been very great, we went freely 
all over the island, whenever we found occasion ; and as we had our escape or deliver- 
ance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out 
of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our

work, and I net Friday and hw father to cut thorn dawn ; and than I caused the SpanUni, 
to whom I imparted my thought* on that aflkir, to overate and direct their work. 1 
showed them with what indefatigable pain* I had hewed a Urge tree into angle 
planks, aud I caused them to do the like, till they had made about a down Urge plank* 
of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-Eve feet long, and from two inches I- 
inches thick : what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imgint 

lie same time, I contrived to increase my little stock of Ume goat* as much a* I 
could ; and t<>r tliis purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go oat one day, and 
myself with l-Yiilay the next day (for we took our turn*), and by *Kfa means we got 
about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest ; for whenever we shot the dam, we 
saved the kids, and added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing toe 
grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I 
believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could bare 
filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with our bread, formed a great part of our food 
very good living too, I assure you, for they are exceeding nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order ; it was not the most plentiful 
increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer our en 
from twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred 
and twenty bushels ; aud the like in proportion of the rice ; which was store enough 
for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore 
with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have 
victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that U to ay, of 
America. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work 
to make more wicker-work, viz., great baskets, in which we kept it ; and the Spaniard 
was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make 
some thing!* for defence of this kin 1 of work ; but I saw no need of it. 

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests expected, I gave the 
Spaniard leave to go over the main, to see what he could do with those he had left 
behind him there, I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with him who 
would not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old savage, that he would no 
way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should tind in the i.-hnul, who was so 
kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but that they would stand by 
him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went, would be 
entirely under and subjected to his command ; and that this should be put in writing, 
and signed with their hands. How they were to have done this, when I knew they had 
neither pen nor ink that, indeed, was a question which we never asked. Under these 
instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, tin- fath-r of Friday, went away in one of 
the canoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought in, when 
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a musket) 
with a fire-lock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to 
be very good liusbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasion. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view of my 
deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them provisions of 
bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient for all 
the Spaniards for about eight days' time ; and vi>hini: them a good voyage, I aa\\ 
go, agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I 
should know them again, when they came back, at a distance, before they came on 
shore. T^ey went away, with a fair gale, on the day the moon was at full, by my 

167 ' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



account in the month of October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had 
once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the nnmUer of years 
so punctually as to be sure I was ri^lit ; though, as it proved, when I afterwards 
examined my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no leas than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and unii-i 
Accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was 
fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and 
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they are come!" I jumped up, and, 
regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could get my rl-.tln-s <>n, through my little 
grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, 
regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do : but I 
was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league 
and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they 
call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in : also I observed. j.ivs. -ntly, 
that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southern- 
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, and hade him lie close, for these 
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were 
friends or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see 
what I could make of them ; and, having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top 
of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my 
plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when n> 
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance 
from me, 8.8.K, but not above a league and a half from the shore. By my observation, 
it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long- 
boat. 

I cannot express tlje confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship, and one 
that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and e,,i,,,-,pientlv 

"la, was such as I cannot describe ; but yet I had some secret doubts hung al 
me I cannot tell from whence they came bidding me keep upon my guard. In the 
first place, it occurred to me to consider what business an Kn^lL-h ship could have in 
that part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where 
the English had any traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms to dri\e I..-IM in 
there, in distress ; andth.it if they were really Kn-lish, it was most probable that they 
were here upon no good design ; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into 
the hands of thieves and murderer*. 

Let no man despise the secret hint* and notices of danger which sometimes arc 
him when be may think there is no possibility of its being real. That su.-h hinu and 



notices are given us, I believe few made any observations of things ran d- 

that they are certain discoveries of an invi.nil.lo world, and a convene of spirit*, we 
cannot doubt ; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of dan-..,-. hy 
should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whrt ! 
and subordinate, is not the question ), and that they are gi r -..,] /

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



: formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a 
J mile from me ; which was very happy for me ; for otherwise they would have landed 
just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and 
perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied 
( they were Englishmen, at least most of them ; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it 
did not prove so ; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were 
unarmed, and, as I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of them were jumped 
on shore, they took those three out of the boat, as prisoners : one of the three I could 
pe*eeive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a 
kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hand sometimes, 
and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly 
confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called 
out to me in English, as well as he could, " O master ! you see English mans eat prisoner 
as well as savage mans." " "Why, Friday," says I, " do you think they are going to eat 
them, then I**" Yes," says Friday, "they will eat them."" No, no," says T, "Friday ; 
I am afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may be sure they will not eat 
them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood trembling 
with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the three prisoners should be 
killed ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the 
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men ; and I expected to see him fall 
every moment ; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I 
wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I 
IttA any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have secured 
the three men, for I saw no fire-arms they had among them ; but it fell out to my 
1 another way. After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by 
the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the land, as if they 
wanted to see the country. I observed also that the three other men had liberty to go 
where they pleased ; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and 
looked like men in despair. This" put me in mind of the first time when I came on 
bore, and began to look about me ; how I gave myself over for lost ; how wildly I 
looked round me ; what dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how T lodged in the tree all 
night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasta. As I knew nothing, that night, of t ho 
supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the 
storms and tide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported ; so these 
three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they v 
how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in a conditioi 
safety, at the same time th.-y thought thenwclves lost> and their case desperate. So 
little do we tee before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully 

> the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures so absoln 
destitute, l.ut that, in tho worst circumstances, they have always something to bo 
thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine ; nay, aro 
even brought to their deliverance by the means by win. -h tln-y seem to be brought to 
their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore ; and whil< 
rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the . 
tide WJM spont, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. 
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too ^

DELIVERANCE IN AN UNCOUTH FORM. 



h brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the ot 
an 1 lin-liji^ the boat too fast aground f*r him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who 
were straggling about ; ujxjn which they all soon came to the boat ; but it was past all 
th* ir strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side 
In ing a soil oozy sand, almost like a quicksiml. In this condition, like true seamen, 
who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and 
away they strolled about the country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to 
another, calling them off from the boat, "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll 
float next I was fully continued in the main inquiry of what couir 

men they were. All this while I kept myself close, not once daring to stir out of my 
castle, any farther than to my place of observation, near the top of the hill ; and 
glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours 
before the boat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, an<l I might be at 
more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their <li~< -<>urse, if they had any. In the 
meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with more caution, knowing 
I hud to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first I ordered Friday also, 
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I 
took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was 
very fierce ; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned* 
a naked sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it was dark ; 
but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found, in short, they were all gone 
straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep. The three poor 
distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down 
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought* 
out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and 
learn something of their condition ; immediately I marched as above, my man Friday at 
a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so 
staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and 
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, " What are ye, gentle- 
men ? " They started up at the noise, but were ten times more confounded when they 
saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I 
thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English : 
" Gentlemen," said I, " do not be surprised at me : perhaps you may have a friend near, 
when you did not expect it." " He must be sent directly from heaven, then," said 
one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time ; " for our 
condition is past the help of man." "All help is from heaven, sir," said I: "but 
can you put a stranger in the way to help you ? for you seem to be in some great distress. 
I saw you when you landed ; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes 
that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looked like one

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



have mutinied against me ; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, 
at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me one 
my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing the place to be 
uninhabited) and know not yet what to think of it" Where are these brutes, your 
enemies I " said I ; "do you know where they are gone ? " " There they lie, sir," said 
he, pointing to a thicket of trees ; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, 
and heard you speak ; if they have, they will certainly murder us all." " Have they 
any fire-arms t " said I. He answered, * They had only two pieces, one of which they 
left in the boat** " Well then," said I, " leave the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep ; 
it is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners ? " He told 
me there were two desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any 
mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty. 
I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them, 
but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct " Well," says I, " let us 
retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So 
they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them. 

" Look you, air," said I ; " if I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing to 
make two conditions with me ? " He anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he 
and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in everything ; 
and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the 
world soever I would send him ; and the two other men said the same. " Well," said 
I, " my conditions are but two ; first, that while you stay on this island with me, you 
will not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon 
all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, 
and in the meantime be governed by my orders ; secondly, that if the ship is or may 
be recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free." 

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of a man could devise that 
he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to 
me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. " Well, then," said I, 
" here are three muskets for you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what you think i 
proper to be done." He showed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able, 
but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing 
anything ; but the best method I could think of was to fire on them at once as they lay, 
and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, 
and so put it wholly upon God's providence to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, 
that he was loth to kill them, if he couM lu-lp it ; but that those two were incorrigible 

:ns, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we 
should be undone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's company, 
and destroy us all " Well, then," says I, " necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the 
only way to save our Jives," However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I 
toM him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon after we saw 
two of them on their feet I asked him if cither of them were the men who he had said 
were the heads of the mutiny! He said, "No." ' W, 11. th.-n," said I, "you may let 
them escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save them- 
selves. Now," gays I, if the rest escape yon, it is your fault" Animated with this, he 
took the musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two com- 
rades with him, with each man a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going

first made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, 
and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for the 
moment he cried out they fired I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving 
his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one 
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; but not being 
dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other ; but the 
c:il't;iin, stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call 
upon God to forgive his villany, and with that word knocked him down with the 
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more : there were three more in the 
company, and one of them was slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and 
when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. 
The captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance 
of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be 
faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to 
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their 
sincerity that could be desired; and he was willing to believe them, and spare their 
lives, which I was not against, only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot 
while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the boat, with 
orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they did ; and by-and-by 
three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back 
upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now 
their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete. 

173 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another's cireum- 
I began first, and told him mj whole history, which he heard with an attention 
even to amazement, and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished 
with provisions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of 
wonders, it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and 
how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran 
down his face, and he could not sjieak a word more. After this communication was at 
Ml end, I carried him and his two men into my apartments, leading them in just where 
I came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I refreshed him with such provision as 
I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long inha- 
biting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; but above all, the 
captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a 
grove of trees, which, having been now planted near twenty years, and the trees growing 
much faster than in England, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable 
in any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage 
into it I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the 
country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show 
him that too another time ; but at present our business was to consider how to recover 
the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what 
measures to take, for that there were still shc-and-twenty hands on board, who, having 
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, 
would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that if 
they were subdued they should be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, 
or to any of the English colonies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them 
with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very rational con- 
clusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw 
the men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, 
and destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the 
ship's crew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat, would 
certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that then, perhaps, 
they might come armed, and be too strong fur us : this he allowed to be rational Upon 
this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the 
beach, so that they might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave her so 
far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arms whi<-h 
were left on board out of her, and whatever else we fouud there, which was a bottle 
<>f tirandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump 
of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or MX pound*) ; all which was 
welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the can, most, sail, and rudder of the 
boat were carried away before), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if the\ 
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was 

much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my view was, 
that if they went away without the boat, I <lil u-.t n,u. h jur--ti..n to make her again 
fit to carry us to the Lwward Islands, and call upon our frimrl* the Spaniards in my 
way, for I had them still in my thoughts. 

'74 ' 



PREPARATIONS FOR A CONT 



While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength, heaved 

the boat upon the beach, BO high that the tide would not float her off at high-water 

mark, and besides, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and 

were sat down musing what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a 

ith her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on boanl : but no boat stirred ; 

ami they fired several times, making other signals for the boat At last, when all 

i^Tials and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw 

them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row toward* the shore ; 

t >und, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men in h< 
that they had fire-arms with them. 

As the slii|> lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of them as 
they came, and a plain sight even of their faces ; because the tide having set them a 
little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same 
place where the other had landed, and where the boat lay ; by this means I say, we 
had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men 
in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, 
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that 
as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, 
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no cfoubt made desperate in 
their new enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful 
for us. I smiled at him, a:id told him that men in our circumstances were past the 
operation of fear ; that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that 
which we were supposed to be in, wo ought to expect that the consequence, whether 
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the 
circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for. 
" And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save 
your life, which elevated you a little while ago ? For my part," said I, " thero seems 
to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." " What is that ? " says he. " Why, 
said I, "it is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them, which 
should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should hare thought 
God's providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands ; for depend upon 
it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us." 
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it - 
encouraged him ; so we set vigorously to our business. 

\V- luul, upon the first appearance of the boats coming from the ship, considered 
of separating our prisoners ; and had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, 
of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of tlie 
three delivered men to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of 
being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods, if they could have 
d livn-ed themselves; here they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and 
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or 
two; but that if they attempted tlu-ir i-scapf, they should be put to death without 
mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and wrre 
very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and a light left them : 
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort ; and they 
did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were kept pinioned, indeed, 
: the captain was not free to trust them ; but the other two were taken into my 



WT 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



service, upon the captain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live 
and die with us ; so with them and the three honest men we were seven men, well 
armed; and I made no doubt we should bo able to deal well enough with the ten that 
were coming, considering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men 
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran 
their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which 
I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor 
some distance from the shore, with some hands in. her, to guard her, and so we should 
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to 
their other boat ; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her 
stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they 
had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all 
their might, to try if they could make their companions hear ; but all was to no purpose : 
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, 
we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring ; but it was all one ; those in the cave, 
we were sure, could not hear ; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well 
enough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at the surprise 
of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to their 
ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; 
accordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing they would 
go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he 
should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered ; but he was 
quickly as much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them all coming 
on shore again ; but with this new measure in their conduct, which it seems they 
consulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on 
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows. This was a great disappoint- 
ment to us, for now we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore 
would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape ; because they would row away 
to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so 
our recovering the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and 
see what the issue of things might present. The seven men came on shore, and the 
three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came 
to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the 
boat Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little 
hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see them plainly, though they could 
ii.it ] i. < i\r us. "We should have been very glad if they would have come nearer to us 
so that we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we 
ini^ht come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the hill where they 
could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east p;nt, 
and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary : and 
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat 
down together, under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to .sleep 
there, as the other party of them h;nl dmu-, they had done the job for us ; but they were 
too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell 
what the danger was they had to 1- 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs, viz., 

176 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, 
and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all 
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. 
I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to 
them before they could load their pieces again. But this event did not happen ; and we 
lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to take. At length, I told them there 
would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night ; and then if they did not return to 
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might 
use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great 
while, though very impatient for their removing ; and were very uneasy, when, after 
long consultation, we saw them all start up, and march down towards the sea : it seems 
they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go 
on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their 
intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as it really was, 
that they had given over their search, and were for going back again ; and the captain, 
as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it : but I 
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end 
to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over tin- little creek westward, 
towards the place where the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so 
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them 
halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that 
as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again ; and 
then keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the others hallooed, to 
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel 
about again to me by such ways as I directed. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed ; and they 
presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice 
they heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the water being up, they 
could not get over, and called for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, indeed, I 

, '. i. vTbtttiMjLftd ' 'I.'!!! I'.. --..Ver, I ..l.^erved tliat ll,.- l,..:it l.eili:,' U 'nr U|.:l 

good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within tho land, they took one of 
the three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having 
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished ir ; 
and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest 
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised tho two men before they 
were aware ; one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The fell< > w 
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up ; the captain, who was 
foremost, ran in U|MH him, and knocked him down ; and tli. n railed out to him in tho 
boat to yield, or he was a dead min. Tin-re needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield, wh. -n he saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down : 
besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as tho rest 

i of the crew ; --fore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards lo 

rely with us. In the mean time, Friday and tho captain's mate so well 

i#-d their business with the rest, that they divw tin-in, ly hallooing and answering, 

:i one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired 

them, but left them where they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; 

i and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back to us. 



IH1-; MUTINEERS CAPITULATE. 



We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall upon 
them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours after Friday came back 
to me before they came back to their boat ; and we could hear the foremost of them, 
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along ; and could also 
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any 
faster : which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat : 
but it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in 
the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to one 
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an 
enchanted island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all be 
murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away 
and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a 
great many times ; but no answer. After some time, we could see them, by the little 
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they 
would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves : then come ashore again, and 
walk about again, and so the same thing over again. My men would fain have had me 
give them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them 
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and especially 
I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were very well 
armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and therefore, to make sure 
of them ; I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep 
upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be 
discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was the principal 
ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited 
of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of the crew ; the captain was 
so eager at having the principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have 
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue 
before ; but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, 
let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot : the next man was shot in the 
body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after ; and the 
third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army, 
which was now eight men; viz., myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; 
the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with 
arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number ; 
and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, call them by 
name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps reduce them to terms ; 
which fell out just as we desired ; for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition 
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could 
to one of them, " Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! " Tom Smith answered immediately, "Who's 
that 1 Robinson ? " for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay ; for 
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment." " Who must we yield to ? Where are they ? " says Smith again. " Here 
they are," says he ; " here's our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you 
these two hours ; the boatswain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; 
and if you do not yield, you are all lost." " Will they give us quarter then 1 " says Tom 
Smith, " and we will yield." "I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," said Robinson : 
so he asked the captain ; and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, you 

179 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



know my voice ; if you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have 
your lives, all but Will Atkins." 

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, "For God's sake, captain, give me quarter; what 
have I done ? They have been all as bad as I : " which, by the way, was not true ; for, 
it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain, when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious 
language. However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and 
trust to the governor's mercy : by which he moant me, for they all called me governor. 
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their lives ; and I sent the man 
that had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then my great 
army of fifty men, which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized 
upon them, and upon their boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for 
reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship ; and as for the 
captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the 
villany of their practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of their design, and 
how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the 
gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he 
told them they were none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island ; that they 
thought they had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God 
so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman ; that 
he might hang them all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he 
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, 
except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, 
for that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect ; Atkins fell 
upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his life ; and all 
the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was come, and that it would 
be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the 
ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a governor 
they had, and called the captain to me ; when I called, as at a good distance, one of the men 
was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the commander calls for 
you;" and presently the captain replied, "Tell his Excellency, I am just coming." 
This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was just by, 
with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing 
the ship, .which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution next 
morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I told 
him we must divide the prisoners, and that In- should %<> ami take Atkins, and t\vo more 
of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave, when- the others lay. This 
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They 
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially 
to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I 
have given a full description : and as it was fenced in, ami they pinioned, the place was 
secure enough, considering they were upon their l>eha\ iour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley with 
them ; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or 
not to go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, 

180 > 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



of the condition they were brought to, and that though the governor had given them 
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England, 
they would be all hanged in chains ; but that if they would join in such an attempt 
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in their 
condition ; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest 
imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should 
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over the world ; that they would own 
him for a father to them as long as they lived. " Well," says the captain, " I must go 
and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it." 
So he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed 
they would be faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should 
go back again and choose out five of them, and tell them that they might see that he 
did not want men, that he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the 
governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle 
(my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in 
the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This 
looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in earnest ; however, they 
had no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now the business of the prisoners, 
as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : first, the captain, his mate, 
and passenger; second, then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their 
character from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms ; third, 
the other two whom I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, upon the captain's 
motion, had now released ; fourth, these five released at last : so that they were twelve 
in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board the ship ; 
for as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having 
seven men left behind ; and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder, 
and supply them with victuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them 
fast, but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries ; and I 
made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who told them 
I was the person the govemor had ordered to look after them ; and that it was the 
governor's pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did, 
they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons : so that as we nrvt /rsuH'm <! 
them to see me as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the 
governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now hail n<> difficulty before him, but to furnish lii.s two boats, stop tin 1 
breach of one, and man them. He made his j> : Attain of one, with four oihrr 

men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they contrived 
their business very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they 
came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought 
off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them, and 
the like ; holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the captain 
and the mate entering first with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate 
and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by 
their men ; they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and 

182 



'II IF. SHIP RECOVERED. 



began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below ; when the other boat 
and their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the 
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there 
mis. When this was done, and all safe u|>on deck, the captain ordered the mate, 
with three men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who, 
having taken the alarm, hod got up, and with two nun and a boy had got fire-am. 
t In-ir hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and 
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which 
broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling 
for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, 
shot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, coming out 
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest 
yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be fired, 
which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, which, you 
may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near 
two o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; 
and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something 
surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting up, I heard a man calling me by 
the name of " Governor ! Governor ! " and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when 
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced 
me in his arms. " My dear friend and deliverer," says he, " there's your ship ; for she is 
all yours, and so are we, and all that belongs to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there 
she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore ; for they had weighed her 
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought 
her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek ; and, the tide being up, 
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I first landed my rafts, 
so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for 
I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship 
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was 
not able to answer one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by 
him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately 
pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on 
purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground ; and though it 
brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All 
this while the poor man was in as great an ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise as I 
was ; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to 
myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into con- 
fusion : at last it broke into tears ; and, in a little while after, I recovered my speech ; 
then I took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told 
him I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the whole trans- 
action seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that such things as these were the testimonies 
we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye 
of an Infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help 
to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not to lift up niy heart in thankfulness 
to Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miracu- 
lous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but 
from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed ?

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



VSPIT" 



When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some little 
refreshments, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches that had been so long 
his masters had not plundered him o Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, and 
bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the governor ; and, indeed, it was a 
present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away along with them, 
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and they were to go without 
me. First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six 
large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of 
excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, 
with a bag of peas, and about a hundredweight of biscuit ; he also brought me 
a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, 
and abundance of other things. But besides these, and what was a thousand times 
more useful, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair 
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit 
of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little : in a word, he clothed 
me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may 
imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but never was anything in the world of that kind 
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at their first 
putting on. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought into 
my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners wo 
had ; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them away with 
us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the 
last degree ; and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no 
obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be 
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come at ; and I found that 
the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired 
it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request 
that he should leave them upon the island. " I should be very glad of that," says the 
captain, " with all my heart" " Well," says I, " I will send for them up, and talk with 
them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, 
their comrades having performed their promise ; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, 
and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there 
till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit ; and now I was 
called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be 
brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villanous behaviour 
to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to commit 
further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that 
they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know that by 
my direction the ship had been seized ; that she lay now in the road ; and they might 
see by-nnd l>ye that their new captain had received the reward of his villany, for that 
they might flee him hanging at the yard-ami ; that, as to them, I wanted to know what 
they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my 
commission they could not doubt but I had authority to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to say but this, 
that when they were taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly 
implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them ; for as 
for myself I had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage

with the captain to go for England ; and as for the captain, he 
could not carry them to England, other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried 
for mutiny, and running away with tho ship ; the consequence of which, they 
must needs know, would be tho gallows ; so that I could not tell what was the 
best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they 
desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it, 1 had some inclination to 
give them their lives if they thought they could shift on shore. They seemed 
very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to stay there 
than 1)0 carried to England to be hanged. So 1 left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as it' lie durM 
not leave them there. Upon this L seemed a little angry with the captain, and 
told him that they were my prisoners not his; and, that seeing I had o lie red 
them s.0 much favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did not 
think lit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as F found them ; and if 
he did not like it, he might take them again it' he could catch them. Upon 
this, they appeared verv thankful, and 1 accordingly set them at liberty, and 
bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would

lome fire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should live 
they thought fit U|xm this I prepared to go on board the ship ; but told 
I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on 
board in the mean time, and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore 
next day for me ; ordering him, in the mean time, to cause the new captain, who was 
killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that tin-so men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me in my apartment, and 
entered seriously into discourje with them of their circumstances. I told them I 
thought they had mde a right choice ; but if the captain had carrie 1 th.-m away, th.-y 
would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm 
of the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect 

When they bad all declared their willingness to stay, I told them I would let 
HMM into the story of my living there, and put them into the way o? making it easy to 
them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the ]>! ic-, and of my coming to 
it ; showed them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my .-..m. < 
my grapes ; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them 
story also of the sixteen Spaniards, that were to be expected, for whom I l--n a letter, 
and made them promise to treat them in . .mmon with themselves. 

I left them my fire-arm*, viz., five muskets, three fowling -pi. -co, and three swords. 
I had above a barrel and a half of powder led; for after the first year or two I used but 
little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed the goats, 
and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese. In a w< 
gave them every part of my story; and told them I should prevail with the captain 
to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and Home garden-seeds, whi, -h I told them 
I would have been Tory glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of peas which the captain 
had brought me to eat, and hade them be sure to sow and increase them, 

Having done all this, I left the next day, and went on board the ship. We 
prepared immediately to sail, but weigh that ni-ht. The ,

to bear this ; and remembering what he had done for mo, how he hod taken me 
op at sea, and how generotulr be bad used me on all occasion*, and particular! 
sincere a ft lend 1st wan now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what be had 
Mud to me ; therefore, fir^t, I asked him if his circumntancoM admitted him to spare so 
much money at that time, and if it would not Ktraiton him ) Hi* told me ho could not 
*y hut it might straiten him a little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might 
want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly refrain from 
tram while he spoke ; in short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen 
k to give him a receipt for them : then I returned him the rent, and M-i him if 
ever I had possstaion of the plantation I would return the other to him also (as, i 
I afterwards did); and that as to the bill of wle of his pert in his son's ship. I 
not take it by any means ; but that if I wanted the money, 1 found he wan honest enough

would nrrrr have a penny more from him.

Mcure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use : and as there 
were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter 
my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, 
and that I was the same person who took up the land for th- planting the said

Secondly, there wns the account of four yean more, while they kept the effects in 
their btin^, before the gOTirnmsnl ffhiintrii the ^ministration, as ^ring the effects of a 
per** not to be found, which they oOled civil death ; and U balance of this, tbe value 
of the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six 
erawlua*, being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidorea. 

Thirdly, there was the Prior of the Augustine*' account, who bad received the profits 
lor above fourteen yean ; but not being to account for what was disposed of 
hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not

he acknowledged to my account : as to the king's part, tlwt refunded 
nothing. 

o was also a letter of my partner'*, congratulating me very affectionately upon m y 
1" i !._' .1 mo an account how the estate wan improved, and what it produced a 

year; \\ith tin? particular* of the nuinl r of squares or acres that it contained, '

blessings, told me he had said so many Jr Mariu to thank the BletMod Virgin that I 
was , i ting mo very passionately to come over and take possession of my own ; and, 

in tln mean time, to gi iers to whom ho should deliver my effect*, if I 

com concluding with Ji hearty tender of his fii.-nddiip, and that of his family ; 

and M-nt me, as a present, seven fine leopard* skins which h-- liad, it seems, received 
from Africa, by some other ship that IK- had .-. nt thither, and which, it seems, had made 
a better voyn. me also five chests of excellent sweetmeat*, and a 

hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet, my 
two m. : tees shipl>e4 mo one thousand two hu .sts of iragar, eight 

tolls oftoboooo, ami the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the '. than the begin- 

:npossible to express the fluttering of my very heart when I looked over 

illv when I found all my wealth aKout me; for as the Brazil 

ships come all in fleets, the same ships which Kp'ti^ht my letters brought my goods : 
ami the effects were safe in the :<>re the letters came to my hand. In a 

w.ird, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man run an<i ue a 

cordial, I believe the sudden surprise < tset nature, and 1 had died u|--n 

the spot : nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician 
being sent for, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered 
me to let blood; after which I f, and grew well : but I verily believe, if 

I had not been eased by the vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died. 
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above fifty thou- .md pounds sterling in money, 
and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a 
year, as sure as an estate of lands in K:i_;und : and, in a I was in a condition 

which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose n\\ uent 

o The frr>t tiling I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old 
Captain, who had } iiaritable to me in my distress, kind to me in the beginning, 

honest to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent to me ; I t->ld him that, 
next to the providence ,,f Heaven, which disposes all tiling, it ivas owing to him : 
that von me to reward him, I would do a hundred-fold : so I first 

; IHH! to him the hundred nioido:v.s I had received of him ; then I sent for a notary 

caused him to draw np a gem-ral release or discharge from the four hundred and 
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owe. the fullest and firmest 

manner possible. After u huh, I caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to 
bo the m ts of my plantation ; and appointing my partner to 

account him, and make the rctu tlcets, to him in my name; and 

by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him during his 
s, and fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life : and 

v to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do with the 
Btat- us put into my hands ; nnd indeed, I had more care upon 

my head now i .in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted nothing

Having than settled my aflairs, aoM my carg<s and turned all my effect* into good 
bilk of exchange, my next difficulty waa which way to go to England : I had been 
gh to the tea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea 



at that time ; and though I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increase*! M\*-I 
me so much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered 
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times. 

It u true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and that might bo one of the reasons ; 
hut Irt no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment : 
two of the ships which I had singled out to go in I mean, more particularly singled out 
than any other having pot my things on board one of them, and in the other having 
agreed with tne captain ; I my two of these ships miscarried ; viz., one was taken by 
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people 



so that in either of those 






which most, it was hard to say. 

Having been thus harassed in ay thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I communicated 
rrrrything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by hm< 1 1' 
and nw over the Bay of Biscay to Bpehelie, from whence it was but an easy and safe 
Joaiasj by bad to Paris, and so to Odais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and wall 
the way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepossess^ against my going 
by eta at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land ; 
which, as I wan not in haste, an 1 did not value the charge, was by much thr plcaauiter 
and to make it more so, my old captain brought an English getitl<<iun. the son 
of a merchant in l.il..n. wh.. wan willing t travrl with me; after which we ; 
up two ore English merchant ,| two young Portuguese gentlemen, the Ut 

going to Paris only ; to that in all, there were six of us, and five servaiK 
evahants ami t rtuguse contenting themselves with one servant between 

two, to save the chargn ; and as for me, I got an English sail h me as a 

atrvant, btsides my man Friday, who was toomuchasUmngrrtobeca|blfnfiiup|>]\iti^ 
the place of a servant upon the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company Wing very w<>ll m< 
and armed, we made a littlr tr-.p, whnW they did roe the honour to call me c 
M "rll because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servant*, and, index*!, was 
the origin of the whole journey.

stay aome time to see the - j wiin, and what was worth obse

middlo of October; hut when we came to the edge of Navarre, 
way, with an account that HO much snow was 
., that several traveller* were obliged to come 
::''. -i- li i\ ing attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on. 

When wo came to Pampeluna it-. -If, \v.- t . n, 1 ii M indeed ; and to me, that had 

been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could scarce bear any 

cold was iiiHiiflurabln ; nor, indeed, was it moro jminful than it W;LS 

MirpriMtur, to . VH before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not 

only warm. hot. :md immediately to feel ft wind fruu the Pyrenean Moi 

. keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, an 1 t., . n danger benumbing and 

<>f our fingers and t< < . 

Poo rat really frightened when h- saw the mountai ered with snow, 

it col. I weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the 

matter, after we c.ime to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much violence, and 

,', that tin- people said winter was come before its time ; and the roads, which were 

diiHi-ult hefmv, were now quite impassable; in a word, the snow lay in some places 

too thick liir us to travel, and ln-ing not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern 

countries, th-iv WM no going without being in danger of being hurif 1 alive every step. 

in twenty days at Pampelnna ; when (seeing the winter coming on, 

and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over i 

.id l>een known in many years) I proposed that we should go away t. 

arabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while 

I was considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped 

MI the r'reneh side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, 

: he country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains 

by such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow ; for where they met 

with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen liard enough to bear them and their 

horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same 

ith no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed -nfliciently to protect our- 

from wiM Least > ; for, he said, in these great snows, it was frequent for some 

wolves to show them-elves at the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want 

of food, the ground being covered with snow. We told him wo were well enough 

prepared for such creatures as they were, if ho would insure us from a kind of two-legged 

. whi.-h, we are AVIV in mo<t danger fn> : ,. ly on the I 

..f the mountains. He satisfied us that there wn- no danger of that kind in the way 
re to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentle- 
in. 11. with their servants, some Fn Spanish, who, as I said, had atteni; 

go, and were obliged to come hack n 

'idinu'ly, we s. i out fro;,! I'ampeluna with our guide, on the 1 ->th of November ; 
i.lerd, 1 WM Mil-prised, when, instead of going forward. In- 6 
us on road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles; \\ '. 

passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm 
climate again, wh.re the eountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a 
sudde I to his left, he approached the mountains another way ; and though it 

t'.i" hills and piveipi.vs ]o,,ked dreidful. yet he made so many tours, such 
au I VJ us hy Mich winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the 

195 






ins without being much sncumbnrtil with the snow ; and all on a 
us the pleasant and fruitful province* of Lsngnedoe and Qescony, all green and 
hough, indeed, they were at a great distance, and we had some rough 
way to pate still 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day and a 
night so met that we could not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past 
it all : we fond, indeed, that we began to descend very day, and to come mote north 
than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on. 

U was about two hours before night, when, our guide being something before us, and 
not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, i 
hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolvea new n )M .n the guide, and, had 
be IM to befeitns, he won)* have been devoured belb^ have helped him, 

one of them fclTn il upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence 
that he had not time or presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and 
cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday being i>. -id., him ride up, and 

see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out 
as loud as the other, "Oh, master! Oh,master: a bold follow, rode din vtly ,, to 



It wae happy lor the poor man that it was my man K. . i..y ; f -r. having been need 
to such uealures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went clone up 
hot him ; whereas, any other of us would have fired at a farther distance, add have 

Bat it was enough to have terrified a bolder man tl 1. indeed, it alarmed 

all our company, when, with the noise of Friday*! pistol, we heard on both sides the moat 
dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, 
that it was to us aa if there had been a prodigious number of them ; and perhaps there 
wse not sneh a lew an that we had no cause of ap|ehensioti ; however, as Friday had 
killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and 



fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fiwtened u,*,n hi. head, where the 
bosses of the bridle had stock in his teeth. But the man wa* mo r the raging 

rrmtnre had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; 
he was just, as it were, tumbling down by the disorder of his bone, when Friday came 
up and -hot the wolf. 

easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mcnd<*l our pace, and 
rode up as fsst as the way, which was very difficult, would give tu leave, to sse what was 
the matter. As soon as we came clear es, which blinded us before, we saw 

plainly what bad been the ca% and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though 
we did not piMnUy discern what kind of cwaturo it was he had killed. 

nrr^r was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner, as that 
which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, though at fir* we were 
uqvised and afraid for ym, the greatest diversion imaginable. As the boar i a heavy, 
clumsy creature, and doss not gallop as the wolf dose, which U swift ami light. *o he has 
two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions; first, as to men, 
- not his proper prey (he doss not usually attempt them, except they first attack 
him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it b probable might now V the case, the 
ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, ho will not meddle 
with you ; but then you must take care to be very civil to him. and p-o |,i m the road, 
for he w a very nice g nUeman ; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince ; nay, 

196 






if you are really afraid, your best way is to look aaotker way and keep going ,.- 
isiiiiiisii if you atop, and stand still, and lotik ateadmstly at him, h- :,. r an 

affront ; but if you ikrow or toss anything at bim, and it hiu him, though it wen- l.ut a 
lick a* big as your finger, be takes it for an affront, and sets all other business 
aide to pursue kis revenge, and will have satbrfaetion in point of honour that is hi. 
iret qwuity : Ike next U, tkal if be be once affronted, be will never leave you, night or 
day. 101 be bas bad bis revenge, but follow at a good round rato till be overtakes you. 

toaa Friday bad delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he was 
helping him off from ki. korse, for Ike man was both hurt and frightened, and indeed 
Ike last more than tbe finrt, when on a sodden we e|.i.-.l the bear com. 
wood, and a vast, monstrous one it was, tbe biggest by far that ever I saw. We 
were all a little surprised when we saw bim ; but when Friday mw him, it wa. easy 
to see joy and courage in Ike fellow's countenance : * Oh, ok, ok !" * thm- 

times, pointing to kirn; "Ok, master! yon give me te* leave, me shakee to hand ith 
bim ; me makee yon good laugh." 

I was svrprissd to see Ike fellow so pleased: You fool," said I, -he will eat 
you up."" Kale* v* up! ealee m up !" say* Friday, twice over again ; " me eatee 
bim up ; me makeo you good laagk ; yon all stay here, me show yon good laugh." So 
down be rita, and get. bk boot, off in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call 
Ike flat akoea Ikey wear, and which he In I in hit i^-k.-t), give, my other servant hi* 
kone, and wiib kis gun away ke flew, swift like th- * 

Tke bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till Friday 
coming pretty near, calls to him, a. if the bear could understand him, " Hark ye, bark 
ye," says Friday, * me upeakec with you.** We followed at a distance, for now being come 
down to Ike Oasoony aide of Ike mountains, we were entered a va*t, groat forest, where 
Ike country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scatter* 

and took up a great stone, and tho-w it at him. m,d hit hi., 
kirn BO more karm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it answered F> 
end, for Ike rogue was so void of fear that be <1 y to mnko the bear follow him, 

and skow us some laugh, as ke call- soon as Ike bear felt the stone, and mw 

kirn, ke tarns about, and comes after him, taking very long strides, and shuffling on at a 
atwifs rate, so as would nave p it a horse to a middling gallop ; away runs FridV 
tokes kis course a* if h ran toward, as for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once ti|.u 
Ike bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at kirn keartih ugtkehear 

back npnn us when be was going about bis own business another way ; and especially I 
was angry thai ht bad turned Ibe bear upon a* and then run away ; and I called out, 
M Youdog! M sidf. M tbUyourmakiiigiislaiigkt Come away, and lake your bom, that 
we may boot the creators." He bean) me, and cr Xo shoot, no .boot ; stand 

j grt i.meb laugh;" and as Ike nimble creature ran two feet !'? f',. l*M' 
one, ke turned on a sodden CM one aide of us, and using a great oak tree fit t 
purpnws ke beckoned as to follow; and doubling hi. pace, be got ninthly up the tree, 
laying kis gun down upon Ike ground, at about five or six yard, from the bottom of the 
tree. Tbe bear soon came to Ike tree, and we followed at a di.uner ; tbe fin* thing he 
did, be stopped at tbe gun, smelled at it, hut let it lie, and up be scramble, into the tree, 
climbing like a cat, though an monstrous heavy. I was amassd at the folly, a* I thought 
it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till seeing tbe bear 
get np Ike tree, we all rode near to kirn.

ii we came to t!..- tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a largv 1 i m b 

to tree, and the bear got about half way to him. A* aoon o the bear got out to that 

!> tree w.ia weaker " Ha ! " say* he to iw, " now you co me 

teachee the bear dance;" no ho began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the 
bear bega . l.ut Mood -till, and began to look In-hind him, to see how heh

a great <1 . still, ho called out i^ain, an if he had 

supposed tli" bear couU . you no c- : ? pray you come 

farther;" N. he left jumping and .shaking the I-MI-II : and tin- )> ar. just a if he lad 
understood wi a little farther ; then he began jumping again, and 

tin- bear stopped again. Wo thought now was a good time to knock him ou the head, 
I to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear ; but he cried out earn- 
shoot, me shoot by and thru ;" ho would have Kaid hy-and 
M the story, Friday danced so much, ami the bear stood so tickl i>h. 
we had latighing enough ind !, l.ut still conld not imagine what thefeilow would do 

Jit lie depended upon shaking tin: bear nil' : and we found the bear was too 

running for that too ; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung 

with his great l>n>ad claws and feet, so that wo could not imagine what would be 

tin- nul of it, and what thejest would be at last. Hut Friday put us out of doubt ipiickly : 

.: the l>ear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not In- 1 to come 

any farther, " Well, well," says Friday, "you no come farther, me go : yon no come to 

DM come to you;" and upon this he went out to the smaller end of t: 
where it wmild bend with his weight, and gently let himself down l>y i 
the bough till he cam.,' near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his 
gun, took it up, and stood still. " Well," said I to him, " Friday, what will yon do now I 
Why don't you shoot him ? " " No shoot," says Friday, <; no yet ; me shoot now, me 
no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh :" and, indeed, so he did, as you will see 
ntly; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came Lack from the bough 
where lie Mo.nl, hut did it very cautiously, looking behind him ;, and CO1 

ward till he got into the body of the tree; then, with the same hinder 
. lie <ame down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a 
time, v-ry lei-urcly. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind 

the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the : into 

his tar. and shot him dead as a stone. Then the rogue turned about t-- did 

not laugh : and whm lie saw we wen- pi- ;r looks, he began to laugh \ 

loud. ''So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you kill them ." says 1 ; 
"why, you have no guns." "No," -mi, but shoot great much '. 

This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our

many of their sheep and hone*, and some people too. We had one dangerous place to 
pass, and onr guide told us, if there were more wolves in the country we should iiml 
them there ; and this was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a long 
narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then we 
to the village where we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of 
when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain : 
we met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood 
which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full 
peed, oae after another, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in \ i 
they took no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon i 
oar guide, who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready

and uur ye about us ; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, 
which vms nnu- half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as wo came into the j. 
v had OOOMIOO enough to look about us : the first object we met with was a dead 
bre , that i* to say a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of 
them at work, we eould not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had 
eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to dUturl. them at their feast,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



: : 



Ktiow of my wife's brought me a little out of the vapours, and 



I began to consider what I was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to 
argue with myself sedately what business I had, after threescore years, and after such a 
life of tedious suffering* and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner I say, 
what business had I to rush into new ^Mfr 1 *, and put myself upon adventures fit only 
for youth and puieUj to run into I 

With those thoughts I considered my new engagement ; that I had a wife, one child 
born, and my will then great with child of another ; that I had all the world could give 
me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain ; that I was declining in years, and ought 
to think rather of leaving what I had gained tlian of seeking to increase it ; that a* to 
what my wife had said of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my 
duty to go, 1 had no notion of that ; so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled 
with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it ; as I believe jtoople may 
alway* do in like cases if they will ; and, in a word, I conquered it ; composed myself 
with such argument* as occurred to my thought*, and which my present condition 
furnUbed me plentifully with ; and particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved 
to divert myself with other things, and to engage in some business that might effectually 
tU m op froui any more excursions of this kind : for I found that thing return uj.n 
me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of 
before me. To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, and 
resolved to iMiOti myself iMrnm I had a little convenient house upon it, and t In- 
land about it, I found, was cabbie of great improvement ; and it was many ways 
riled to my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and 
improving of land ; and particularly, being an inland county, I was removed from 
convening ainong sailoi^ and thiiigs relating to the remote parts of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, l-.u-ht ploughs, harrows, 
a caH, wagon, bonss, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in one 
half-year a mere country gentleman ; my thoughts were entirely Uken up in managing 

j mi Mil. HsU I Hint 1 1141 1. 1 slug |1 nlii ^ i . and I lived, as I thought, 

the most agreeable life thai nature was capable of directing, or that a man always bred 
to misfortunes was capable of retreating to. 

I Canned upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no article* ; I 



up or cut down as I |Jea**d ; what I planted was for myself, and what I 
ImyniMil was for my family ; and having thu left off the thought* of wandering, I had 
ne4 the I**** discomfort in any part of life as to this world. Now I thought indeed that 
I enjoyed the middle state of life, which my father so earnestly recommended to me, 
and livid a Und of iMnvenly life, something like what is oWribed by the pott, upon 
tbe snbjscl of n country life >-

the end they proposed still fled from them loemre every day u 

of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance ; and the men of labour 
spent their strength in daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they 
laboured with; so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but t*. work, ami 
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of wmnsomo life, and a weari- 
some life the only ocovuon of daily bread. 

This pot me in mind of th. life I liv,- 1 in my kingdom, the island ; where I suffered 
no more corn togrow, because I did not wat more goats, because I had 

no more use for them ; where the money lay in i m.xil.ly, an.! 

eme the mvour to be looked upon in t , nty years.

religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search farther than human

ear, or food to one thai has no taste ; in a word, I resolved to leave off hou*ek< 
my farm, and return to London ; and in a few months after I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before ; 1 had no n-ii .1, f., r

Upon thw, w concluded it must \>c some ship on lire at ueu ; and as, by our hearing the

ward* it, and were preaentlj satisfied we should li-.-..\.-r it, because tin- faith* i 
aailcd, the greater the light appeared; though, the weather being hazy, \** rould

some .ship miirht h.ij'p.'ii to ho atsea, and mL'ht take them in. Th.-v had Hails, oars, and

In the midst of th MM- being hopeless and ready to despair,

f hearing a gun tin-, and after th.it fonr nunv : these were the five guns which I caused

tpon the hearing of these guns that they took down their masts and

thi>, hearing n<> more guns, they fired three nm.-kets, one a considerable while after 
another ; but these, the wind being eontiar r heard. 

Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our 
li'_rhtN and hearing the L.MIIIS which, as I have -aid, I caused to be firetl all the r< 

ighi Tiii- -M them to work with their oars, to keep their Innate ahead, at least, 
that we might the sooner come up with them ; and, at last, to their in> I joy, 

they found hem. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange ecstacies, the 
variety of postures which these po-r delivered people ran into, to express the 
of their souls at so unexpeet.-d a delivej-anee. (Jrief and fear are easily d- 

-, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands, make up the sum of 

ariety; but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it. 
There were some in tears; some raging and tearing them-t l\es. as if they had been in 
the greatest agonies of sorrow ; some stark raving and downright lunatic; some ran 

i the >hip stamping with their feet, other- \\ rin-jing their hands ; some were 
dam-ing, some sing e laughing, more crying, many .juite dumb, not able to

I would not wrong them either ; there might be many th it were thankful afterwards;

master ami hi* two companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them on 
shore in the island, came a little way towards it ; lut nothing was to compare to this, 
either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show themselves in that 
different manner I have mentioned, in different Arsons only ; hut all the variety would 
appear, in a short miccemion of moment*, in one and the same person. A man that we 
w this minute dumb, and, M- it were, stupid and confounded, would the next minnte 
be dancing and hallooing like an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or 
pulling his clothe* to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a madman ; in a 
few momenta after wo would have him all in tear-, then sick, swooning, and, had not 
immediate help been had, he would in a few minutes have l,..,-u dead ; and thus it was 
not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them ; and, if 1 
member right, our surgeon was obliged t<> let l>lo<>d of about thirty of them. 

There were two prieste among thorn : one an old man, and the other a young man ; 
and that which wan strangest was, the oldest man was the worst. As soon as he s. ; 
m board our ship, and -aw him- If -.if.-. ln> dropped dow n stone dead to all aj.j 
ancr ; not the least sign of lite could be perceived in him : our surgeon immediately 
npplied proper remedie* to rec..\ r him, and was tin- only man in the ship that believed 
he was not dead. At length he opened a vein in hi- arm, having tirst chafed and 
rubbed the part, M> an to wan: -h as p-'-^ible. I pon this, the blood, which only 

dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the man opened his eyes; and a 
quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew 1 I in a little time quite well, 

After the blood was stopped, h- walked aU.ut, t..!d us he was perfectly well, took a dram 
of eordial whirh the surgeon gave him, and had come to him-. -If. Al>otit a .Barter of an 
hour aftrr this, they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a 

h woman tlmt had fainted, and told him the priest wan gone stark mad. i 
be bad-begun to revolve the rh.uo- !' his , H in hi- mind, and again this put 

htm into an etar> H <:ts whirled al...ut I'.-ter than the vessels could 

-m, the blood grew hot and feverish ; and the man was a^ tit f..r Pn-dlam aa 
any creature that ever wan in it. The surgeon would not Meed him again in that 
oooditioB, but gave him somethini; to do/e and put him t. ..!,,;, ; \\-hieh, at- i .-m.- 
operated U)mn him, and he a" .m]...,, d and well. 

The younger prient Mm\-d with ^iea- d waa really an 

example of a serious, well-govenxd mind. At his t;i . romingon board th- 
threw himsflf flat on his (ace, pro-*' uuw-lf in thankfuln. , i.,r his d.-liverun.-e, ,,,

WOOD; but ho s|H>ke caluilv, thanked m--. t..ld me ho wa- giving i;..-l thank 
dfli veranoe, begged me to leiive h;n

I was hewrtily w.rry th j.ot only left him. but kopt .. 

from inUrmpting him also. He roiitinucd in that jtotituro nUnit time minutes or 1 
more, after I left him, then came to me, a.s he had said he would, and, with a great deal , 
of neriousnem and afTecti )> t, .,,, i,, 1,,, eyes, thanked me. that had. under God, 

given him and so many miserable creatures their lives. I told him I had n m-ed to t. 11

ROBINSON 



for if an extern of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the read 
their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, 
carry us to t And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding wau h 
our parHit of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sorrow and 

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among oar new guest*, f. 
first day ; tat after they had retired to lodgings provided for them as well as our ship 
would allow, and they had slept heartily as most of them did, U>ing fatigued 
frightened they were tjuito another sort of jwople the 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledge >< kindness shown them, 

was wanting; the Freud., it i, known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that 
The captain and one ..f ti,,. priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak with 
me and my nephew. The commander began to consult with us wh:it hould be done with 
them ; and, first* they told as we had saved th-n In . - N *> all they had was little enough 
for a return to as for that kindness received. The captain said they had saved some 
things of value in their boats, caught hastily out of the flames, 



we would accept it, they were ordered to make an u all to us ; they only desired 

to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get a passage to 
France, My nephew wished to accept their money at first word, and to consider what 
to do with them afterward* ; l.ut I overruled him in that jMirt. r what it was 

to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if t ;ucae captain that took me up 

at sea had served me so, and taken all I had for my deliverance, 1 must have starved, or 
have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been st Barbary, the mere being sold 
to a Mahometan excepted ; and perlia|M a Portuguese U not a much better master than 
a Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in their digress, it 
was true, tat that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures ; and we v 
desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity ; that we had done 
nothing for them tat what we believed th--y w..uld 1., >t' we had been in 

their ca^e, and th. t we took thorn up to *ive them, i... to pl, : 

them ; and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little fi..m them whid, 
had wved out of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave th. m . that ti,i - \\.-uld 
be first to mvc them from death, and then kill them ourselves : wort 1 .; owning, 

and abandon them to at* nd, therefor. . I wool '"' l't thing bo t;. 

from them. As to setting them on shore, 1 told them, indeed, that was an excer 
difficulty to us, for that the ship was l.-.und t > the East Indies ; and though we were 

n out of our course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were directed ly 
Heaven on purpose deliverance, yet it was impoaxiM' for m wilfully to change 

our voyage on their particular account ; nor could my nephew, the . -aptain, an 
the freighters, with whom he was under eharter to pursue his voyage by way < : 
and all I knew we could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with 
other ships homeward bound fro,,, the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, 

! ' . i : !>,. - 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could not but be very 
thankful for it ; tat they were in very great consternation, especially the passengers, at 
the notion of being carried away to the East Indies ; they then entreated me, that as I 
was driven so far to the westward before I met with them, I would, at least, keep on 
the same course to the Bunks of Newfoundland, where it was prokihh- I might n

h some ship or .slo,,p -to carry them back to Canada, from wh 

s-hi this won but a reasonable reqnent on their part, and therefor*- I inclined to 
agree to .deed, I oonaidered that to carry thin whole cornjmny to the East

against the \\ind that they durst not take in pass<-' f.-ar of wanting ; :sfor 

the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in ; go we were obliged to 
-about a week after this that wn made the 1 Junks of Newfoundland; where, 
to shorten my story, we put all our r'n-neh people on board a barque, which they hired 
at s. put them on slime, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they cot ild 

get] bo \ietual themselves with. \vhen I say all the r'n-neh went : 

should remember, that the young priest I spoke _' we were bound to the ! 

Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of 

i.-l ; whieh I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had 
good reason, as will ap)>ear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered themselves on 
our .ship, and proved verv u-ft'ul l\-'. 

i hence we directed our course for the West Indie*, steering away 8. and S. by 

twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind at all ; when we 
with another subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deploraMe as 

before, 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the l!th day of March, 
; >, \\hen we spied a sail, our course S.E. and by S. We soon perceived it was a 
laix'e vessel, and that she bore up to us, hut could not at first know what to make of her, 
till, aft i ! e< >ming a little nearer, we found she had lo>- mast, foremast, and 

1 presently she tired a gun as a signal ..I 'distress. The weather was j>i 
\.N.\V. a fre-h gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

\\ : .mid her a ship of Bristol, bound h..m. -from Harbadoes, but had been blown 

of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible 

hurricane, while the , -apt ain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that, besides

But that which wiui wont of all, wan, that they were almost starved for want of

they had not one ounce left in tin- ship, and had had IK-H-- tor eleven ,1.,\ .. The

evening before the hurricane began ; and having no jn.. \i-i.iiis of their own i. t't. they 
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest: for th< >am*n. i- m- reduced i<> 
aneh an extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be MI re, t the pr 
passengers; ami they were, indeed, in such a condition that th.-ir mi-.- . hard 

to describe. 

I had |>erha|is not known thiit jmrt, if my curiosity had not led mo (the v . 
being fiur t and the wind abated) to go on board tin- slii). Tin- second mate, \\lio \i|>on

My he, a I beliere they lire dead, fi-r I have li.-ard nothing of them for al*<>v tw<> d 
and I wa* afraid to inquire after them," raid ho, "for I had nothing to relieve them 
with." 

We immediately applied onraelves to give them what relief we could spare : and. 
indeed, I had no far overruled things with my nephew, that I would 1 led 

W had goat away to Virginia, or any other part of the (XNUrf <>f 
to have supplied oumelve* ; but there was no necessity i'.-r that. 
OW they were in a new danp lioy were afraid of eat m,' t<, nnoh, 

tle we gave them. The mate, or commander, brought six men with him in 
but these poor wretches looked like hkeht<>ns. and were so weak that th.-y 
eoold hardly sit to their oars. The mate himnelf was very ill. and hali > he 

declared he )wd reserved nothing from the mm. and w ,-nt hharc and share alike \\ith 
them in every bit thev ate, 

I catttioued him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately ; and 1 
Mi eaten three mouthful* before he began to be *iek ami out of order ; no he strj 
awhile, and onr utirgcoi i-li wime broth, which he said w<mld

meantime. I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to i hem, and 

creature* rather devoured than ate it : they were so exceedingly hungt y that they were 
in a manner ravenous, and Imd no command of them., ; --. ; and two of them ate 
so much greediness, that they were in danger of their lives the next m.-min^ 

night of these people's distress was very moving to me, and 1 

what I had a terrible pronjnvt of at my fint coining on nho.e in my island, where I had 
never the least mouthful of fo,*l, or ant |>nwpc< any ; Inside-* the hourly 

rehensions I had of being made the -her creatures. But all the while tip- 



as thua relating to me tl.- -. of the ship's .- -nij. .r. \ . I . ,, u ld not 

put out of my thought the st<.ry he had t<ld me of the three jK>or creatures in the

their own extremities being so great : by which I undorstood, that they had really 
given them no food at all, and that therefore th.-y mu-t I..- perished, and be nil lyin- 
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin 

At I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board with his m.-n. 
to MfluA them, to I also forgot not the starving crew that were left on board : 
but oideted my own boat to go on board the *hip. ami, with my nmt> and t \\vlvc men, 
to carry them a sack of bread, and four or ii\ .- pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon 
charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while th. v stayed, and to keep guard 
in the cook-room, to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the 
pot before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very Intl.- at a time : 
and by this caution he |nsjunud the men, who w,,,,i,i ,,then* i>- h.i\ kilh-.l th.-m<.-h 
with that very food that was given them on purpose to save thrir lives, 

At the same time, I ordered tho mate to go into tho groat !*,> what con- 

dition the poor passengers were in : and if they were alive, to comfort t h.-m, and give 
tliem wmU refreshment waa proper: and tho surgeon gave him a largo pitcher, with 



of the 






ed brotli which ho had given the mate that wax on board, nn<l which 



he did not Question would restore them p 

I wms not satisfied with this : but, as I mid above, having a great mind to see the 
of misery which I know tho ship it.--lf would prvoiit me with, in n mon Im-ly 
I could have it by report, I took the captain of th- ship. > wo now mlh-.l 
Um with mo, and went myself, a little after, in thrir boat 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get th< \j. tuaU ,. u t of the 
boiler before it was ready ; but the mate observed his orders, and kept a good guar 
the cook-room door ; and the man ho placed there, after using all possible pentun 
to hare patience, kepi them off by force : however, he canted tome biscuit cakes to 
be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, whi. h th. v < ,11. ,1 }.,,.wis, 
and gave them every one tome, to stay th. ir tomacli. and told them i*. wai f.r th. ir 
own mfrty that he was obliged to give them but Intl.- t a tin.,-. Hut it WOK all 

and had I not come on board, an-1 tl ommandor and nfficor* v 

me, and with gnod words, and tome throata alan of giving them no more, I believe 
they would have broken into tho cook-room by force, and torn tho meat out of the 
furnace; for words are indeed of very small force to a hungry U-lh h.-wovrr, we 
pacified them, and fed them gradually ami cautiously for the first, and the next time 
gave them more, and at Us* filled their bellies, and tho mon .1,1 w. 11 enough. 

the miner? of tho poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature, and 
yond the rest ; for aa, first, the ahip's company had so little for themselves, it was 
too true that they had at fimt k.-pt them very low, and at hut totally neglected 
them : sn that for six or tevr had really no food* at 

for severs) days before very little. The poor nn- . AS tho men reported, wa* a ' 

woman of sense and good breeding, had |*rrd all iOio could ao affectionately for her 
ton, that at last abe entirely sank und- 1 when the mate of our ship went 

h .tt n ( .i, the floor or deck, with hor back up against the tides, between two chains

he was sure would not hurt him ; and ax for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, 
he would be very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The surgeon 
represented the case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we took them both on 
board, with all their goods except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed 
or come at ; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his commander si-n 
a writing, obliging nrmself to go Ml soon as ho came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a 
merchant there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter which I 
wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow ; which I suppose 
wa not done, for I could never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is m-i 
probable, lont at sea ; being in so disabled a condition, and so fur from any 1 aid, that I

but, to shorten my story, shall observe that I cam.- to my old habitation, tin- islan-i. 
the 10th of April, 1695. It was with no small difficulty that I found tin- place ; for n^ 1 
ease to it, and went from it, before, on the south and east side of the isl md. coming 
from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the main and the island, and having no chait 
for the coast,, nor any landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I >a\\ 
U or not 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in the mouth of 
the great river Oronooque, but none for my purpose ; only this I learned by my coasting 
the shore, that I was under one great mistake before, viz., that the r..ntim-nt whi. h I 
thought I saw from the island I lived in, was really no continent, but a long island, or 
rather a ridge of island*, reaching from one to the oth.-r side of tin .-xt.-nd. d mouth of 
that great river; and that the savages who came to my island were not prop 
those which we call Caribeeis but Ulanders, and other barbarians of the * 
inhabited nearer to our aide than the rest 

.art I visited several of these islands t.. no purpose ; some I found u... in 
habited, sncf some were not; on one of them I found >..., Spaniard*, and thought i 
had lived there; but |*aking with them, found tin \ hsd a sloop h ing in a small creek 
hard by. and came thither to make salt, and to catch some pearl-mussels if they could . 
but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in th, latitude

and, in short, they had to much more manners Uian I, that I scarce knew how to receive 
their cmlitiea, much leai how to return them in kin-1. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, th- island, after my going away, Uso 
very lenmrkable, and has ao many incident*, which (ho former jwrt of my relation will 
help to unOjenUml, ami which will, in moat of the ]wrticulans refer to the account I 
bar* already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, to the reading 
tf that* that come after me.

told him V and the like ; but I shall collect the fact* historically, as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory, from what they related to me, and from what I met with in 
my mnmniig with them, and with the place. 

* In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as 1 can, 1 must go back t 
dHUMtaoces hi which I left the Uland, and in which the j.<-rsous were of whom I am 
to apeak. And first* it is necessary to repeat that I had sent away Friday's father an.l 
the Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued from the savage*) in a large canoe to 
the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the8|aniard'sconi|MUiion.Htlmt 1.,- 1. it Uhiu.l

or OSJT deliverance ancrwanis. 

When I tent them away, I had no visible ap|arance of, or the least room to hi- 
for, my own deliverance, any more, than I had twenty years before -much less had I 
any foreknowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an Kn^li-l. .ship coming on 
ahore there to fetch me off; and it could not he but a very great surprise to tl 
they cane back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left <>n the 
of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise have been th< ir 



The fin* thing, however, which I ii,. { .ii. ,.) into, that I might begin where I left off, 
vaa of their own part ; and I desired the Spaniard would give me a particular ace 
of his voyage back to his countrymen with tl,.- boat* when I sent hi. 

told me then was little variety in that part, f.r nothing remarkable happen< 
them on the way, having had very calm weather, and a smooth sea. An for his o.untry- 
% it could not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see hitr. (it seems

rxalution in Pharaoh's court ; but when ho showed them the arm*, the powder, the

down, ttMp 0MW to the Spaniards < hom understood Kn-li>h well enouh) : nor 

did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for they agreed N 
well for some time. They gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave. 
they began to live very sociably ; and the h.-ad Spaniard, who had seen p h <>f 

and Friday's father together, managed all their aff.iir- 1-ut as f.-r the 
they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrot*, nnd 
; and when they came home at ni^ht. the s.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



jpBJnf the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they came both 
..ut with their muskets, and the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the 
fellow down thai began the quarrel, with the stock of his musket, and that before the 
otfccir two could come to help him ; and then, seeing the rest come at them, they stood 
together, and |HiwliiMJ, the other end* of their pieces to them, bade them stand off. 

The oihiui had fire-arm* with them too ; but one of the two honest men, bolder than 
hi* comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told them, if they offered to move hand 
or foot, they were dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. They 
did not, indued, lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a 
parley, and they oooamtod to take their wounded man with them and be gone ; and, 
indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow. However, they were 
much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not disarm them 
effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and 
given them an account how the) rnjIMM bad treated them ; for the three villains studied 
mrtMng but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of their rogueries, such 
as treading down their corn ; shooting three youn^ 1 id- and a she-goat, which the [><><>r 
men bad got to breed up tame for their store ; and, in a word, plaguing them night and 
day in this manner ; it forced the two men to such a desperation, that they resolved to 
tight tbrm all three, the find time they hud a lair opportunity. In order t<> d<> 
this, they resolved to go to the castle, as they culled it (that was my old dwelling), where 
Ue three rogue* and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intrndin.u' to have a 
fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play; so they got up in the 
morning before day, and came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their names, 
lellirg a Spaniard, that answered, that they wanted to speak with them. 

It happened that the day before, two ,,(' the Spaniards, having been in the woods, had 
MB CM of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I called the honest men, nnd he 
had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they ha.i met with 
from their three countrymen, and l.-.w thry had mined tin ir plantation, and 
their corn that they had laboured so hard to bring forward, nnd killed the milch-goat 
and their three kids, which was all they had provided f.-r their sustenance ; and that if 
be and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist thorn again, they should l.e 
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at 
thrm took the freedom to reprove the tin,- Englishmen, though in very gentle and 
mannerly terns, and asked them how they could he so cruel, they being harmless, 
umfTrTwure fellow*: that thry were putting themselves in a way to subsist 1>\ 
labour, ami that it had cost them a great deal of (minx to bring thing* to mi. -1. JH-I f <

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly. " \VI,i had they to do there t that 
tVy came on ebon without leave; and that they should i...t plant ,., t.uiM up..,, the

do thea, seignior T mid the Spat. other of the brutesrehm

tho Spaniard ; - they are not bought with your money ; you have no right

given it to them, and no man had anything to do there but themselves ;" nnd with th at,

swore by }\\^ .Maker that they would go and hum all their new hut- : they should luiild 
none upon tin ir land. " Why, sei-nior," >.iys the Spaniard, "by the same rule, we must 
be your servants to- M bold dog, hall, too, before we have 

done with you ; " mixing two or three oaths in t. :nterv.il> of hi-> -peec-h. The 

iard only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, thi- little discourse 
had heated them ; and starting up, one says to the other (I think it was he they called 
Will AtkiiiN), "Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other hru>h with them ; we'll demoli-h 

castle, I'll warrant v>u ; they shall plant no e..l..ny in our dominions." 
Upon this, they went all trooping away, %\ith every man a gun, a pistol, and a 
.], and muttered some insolent things among themselves, of what they would do to 
la too, when opportunity offered ; hut the Spaniards, it seems, did not so 
md them as to know all the parti.-u! in general, they 

them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time th; Spaniards 

said they did not know ; hut t hey wandered aboir of the 

night, and th.n. lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they were 
weary and overslept themselves. The case was this th> y had resolved to stay till 
midnight, and so to take the two poor men when they were asleep, and as they

am! with that they shook hands *nd "wore to one another that they would be revenged 
of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell t<> w..rk with 
the jtoor men's habitation ; they did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but they pulled 
down both their houses, ami pulled them so limb fro in limb that they left not the least 
stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood ; they ton- all 
little collected household stuff in pieces, and throw everything about in -n.-h a m:.i 
that the poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off their habitation. 
When they had done thus they pulled tip nil the young trees whirh th. had

they begged they would send them out some bread in the mean tim?, which they did, 
ending, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, and a boiled parrot, \\ hieh they 
aU> rery heartily, for they were hungry enough. 

After half an hour a consultation, they were called in, and a long debate ensued, th -ir 
two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to mu 
them; all which they owned before, and therefore could not deny now. rp.ni the 
w'jole, th) S^uiards acted the moderators between them ; and as they had obliged il,,- 
two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, so they MOW 
obliged the throe to go and rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to ba of the same and the 
other of larger dimensions than they were before; to fence their ground again where 
they ha J pullei up their fences, plant troes in the roo:n*of those pulled up, dig up the 
land again for planting corn where they had spoiled it, ani, in a word, to restore every- 
thing to the same state as they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it could not 

be, too season for the corn, an! the growth of the treas and hedges, not being possible to

! -.!! 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty of provisions given 
all the while, they grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live pleasantly an 1 
agreeably together again ; only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work 
I Bean for themselves except now and then a little, just as they pleased ; however, 
the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly toge- 
ther, and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, 
and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased ; and thus, having lived pretty 
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them 
liberty to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went abroad, before the 
ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as ever ; but, however, an 
accident happened presently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all ; ami 
they were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the preservation of their 

It happened one night that the Spanish governor, as I call him that is to say, the 
Spaniard whose life I had saved who was now the captain, or leader, or governor of 
the rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any sleep : 
he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only found his thoughts tumul- 
tuous ; hi* mind ran upon men fighting and killing one another; but he was broad awake, 
and could not by any means get any sleep ; in short he lay a great while, but, growing 
more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, on 
goat-skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, and not 
in hammocks and ship beds as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do, when they 
were willing to rise, but to get ui>on their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, 
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided 
than. Being thus got up, he looked out ; but, being dark, he could see little or nothing ; 
and, besides, the trees which I had planted, as in my former account is described, and 
which were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see 
that it was a clear Atari ight night, and, hearing no noi.se. h- n tuin-l aixl laid him down 
again ; bnt it was all one : he could not sleep, nor could he compost- himself to anything 
like rest ; but his thoughts were to the last degr. -e un-a-v. and he knew not for what. 

ng made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and coming in, 
another of them waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was up. The governor told

surprised with swing a light as of fire, a very little way off from thorn, and hearing t i,, 
voieei of men not of one or two, but of a groat number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the aavagei landing on the island, it was my 
constant care to prevent them making the leant diaoovery of there being an. ml. .il.iuuit 
u[-.ii the place ; and when by any occasion they came to kuw it, they felt it ao ertV< tu 
ally that they that got away were scarce able to give any account of it ; for we disappeared 
as soon as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me, eaoape to tell anyone else, except 
it was the three savages in our last encounter, who junt|Hl into the boat ; <>f \vlinu, I 
I was afraid they should go home and bring more I.-!,, Wl,,-t 1,,-r it was 

of the escape of those men that ao great a nuiulier came . 
together, or whether they came ignoranUy, and by accident, <u thrir usual 1. 1.-,. 
the Spaniards could not, it seems, understand ; but, whatever it waa, it h.t.l 1.,-,-t, t 
hnsJness either to have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them at all, much leu 
to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitant* in the place ; or to have 
mUen upon them so effectually as that not a man of them xliouM have escaped, * i 
could only have been by getting in between them and their boats : 1m t this pruaeuoe of 
mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin >t tin ir tnini|iiillity for a grunt while. 

u need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, mii-prixed with this 
sight, ran hack immediately and raised their fellows, giving them an account of the 
imminent danger they ware all in, and they again as readily took the alarm ; l-.t it was 
imposMbto to penmade them to stay close within where they were, but they must all run 
out to *> how things stood 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had opportunity enough,

one another ; what they were doing they knew not, and what U> do themselves they 
knew not : t, the enemy were too nun condly they did not keep

upon tin- Englishmen : tln-ir .-uriosity was iiiij>ortunat- upon tli.-ir pn; 

they must run out anl s.-.- th. how r eveT| th.-y used some caution, too; they did 

not go openly, just by their own dw.-llin^, l.ut w.-nt farther into the woods, and placed 

themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as 

they thought, not be seen by them ; but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall 

find hereafter. 

little was very fierce ; and, if I might Iwlieve the Kni:li>hmeii. <.ne ,,f them said 
he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery, of invim-ihle spirits, and 
of great policy in guiding tin- ti.u'ht. The l.attle, tliey wiid, held two hours before t 
e.nild guess which party would be beaten ; but then that party which was nearest our 
people's habitation began to appear weakest, and after some time more, some of them 
began to fly ; and this put iur men a^.un into a great consternation, lest any one of those 
lied should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and theix-l.y involun- 
tarily diseover th-- place; and that, I >y consequence, the pursuers would do the like 
in si-an-h of them. Upon this, they resolved that thev would stand armed within tin- 
wall, and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally <>ut over the wall and kill 
th.-m. so thai, if po-.sil.le, not one .should return to give an account of it ; they erdered 
also that it .should be done with their >y knocking them down with the stocks

As they exited it fell out; three of the routed army lied for lit'--, and crossing the 

creek, ran dire.-tly into the place, not in tin- least knowing whither they w-nt, l.ut 

running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave 

within, with this addition, to our men's great satisfaction. the 

. i.-n.rs had not pursued th-m. or ^-<\\ hieh way they were gone; ujon this, the

and the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to their 
mtt ~*- Ad thus the S|wniards had the Island again free to themselves, their fright 
was over, and they saw BO savages for several years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and viewing the field 
of tattle, they found about two-and- thirty men dead on the spot ; some were killed with 
great long arrows, nome of which were found sticking in their bodies ; but most of them 
were killed with great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the 
field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many arrows. These swords were strange, 
great unwieldy things, and they must be very strong men that used them ; most of 
those men that were killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, 
or, as we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs 
broken; so that it is evident they fight w it h inexpressible rage and fury. We found 
not one man that was not stone dead ; for either they stay by their enemy till they lm\ 
killed him, or they carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them. 

Thin deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while ; the sight had filled them 
with horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to the last degiv. ,-],., -ially upon 
f^m^fig that some time or other they should fall into the hands of those creatures, who 
Wold not only kill them as enemies, but kill them fur food, as we kill our cattle ; and 
they professed to me that tho thoughts of being eaten up like beef and mutton, though 
it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible 
that it nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, ami 
filled their minds with such unusual terror, that they were not themselves for some weeks 
after. This, a* I amid, tamed even the three English brutes I have been speaking of; 
and lor a great while after they were tractable, and went about the common business of 
the whole society well enough planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised 
to the country. But some time after this they fell into such simple measures again, as 
brought them into ft great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed : and these three being lusty, stout 
young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them to work for them ; and as 
lave* they did well enough ; but they did not take their measures with them as I did 
by my mat^ Friday, viz., to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their 
lives, and then instruct them in the rational principles of life, much less of religion 
civilizing and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguments ; but as they 
gave them their food every day, so they gave them their work too, and kept them fully 
employed in drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they never had them 
t Mftiat them and fight for them as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the 
very flesh upon my bone*. 

But to cme to the family part. Being all now good friends, for common danger, as 
I said above, had effectually reconciled them, they began to consider their p IM m 
cnmstancea ; and the first thing that came under consideration was whether, seeing the 
savages particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there were more remote 
and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to their 
advantage, they should not rather move their habitation, and plant in some more proper 
place for their safety, and especially for the security of their cattle and ->rn. 

Upon this, alter long debate, it was concluded that they would not remove their 
habitation ; because that, tome time or other, they thought they might hear from, tin Mi- 
governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I should In- 
sure to direct them to that side, where, if they should find the ],laee demolished, they 



-w; 



r~> 



would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were gone, and so our 
supply would go too. But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove 
th. ia int.. tin- valley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for both, 
and when-, iudr< -d, then- \va- 1 .nden -u-h ; however, upon second thoughts, they 
altered one part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of 
their cattle thither, and plant part of tln-ir corn tin-re; and so if one part was 
destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part of prudence they used, 
wlii,-h it was very well they did, that they n.-v.-r trusted those three savages, 
which they had taken prisoners, witli knowing anything of the i 
had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the cave 
there, which they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe retreat ; and thitln T they 
carried also the two barrels of powder, \vhi< h I had sent them at my coming 
away. But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation ; yet they 
agreed, that as i hud carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



and then with a grove of treee, so seeing their safety consisted entirely in their 
being uunciesUiil, of which they were now fully convinced, they set to work to c 
and conceal the place yet more effectually than before. For this purpose, as I 
treee, or rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for 
good ittrinnm before the entrance into my apartments, they wmt on in the same 
manner, and filled up the rent of that whole space of ground from the trees I had 
set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I said, I landed my floats, and 
even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to Ian. 1. 
or any sign that there had been any landing thereabouts : these stakes also being of a 
wood very forward to grow, a* T have noted formerly, they took care to have them 
generally much larger and tiller than those which I had planted ; an.', as th.-y gi < -\\ 
*j**cr, ho they planted them so very thick and close together, that when they had hi m 
thmc or four years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any r,.n>ideraUe way 
into the plantation ; and as for that pan which I had planted, the t; 
thick M a man' thigh, and anp-n^ th. m tiiey placed so many other short ours, and M> 
thick, that, in a word, it stood like a palisado a <( < mile thick, and it 

to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little army t. rut it all down for a little 
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. 

Bat this was not all ; f-r they did th.- .si me by all the ground to the right han 
to the left, and round even to the side of the hill, leaving no 

themselves, to come out but by the ladd.-r plae -d up to the side of the hill, and then 
lilted up, and placed again from the first stage up to the top : and when the ladder 
takm down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them. 
This was excellently well contriv, d ; nor was it less than what th. y afterwards found 
oimiion for, which served to convince me, that as human prudence ha- t i 
Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless the direction of I to work ; 

and If we lUtened carefully to the voi am persuaded we might prevent n. 

of the diaastcm which our lives are now, by negligence, subjected to. 

I return to the story. They lived two year* after tins m | 
no more vUiu from the savages. They had, indeed, an aln 

which put them into a great consternir . Home of the S|mni:irds being out early 

one morning on the weH aide, or rather end, of the island (which wo* that end here I 
never went, for foar of bring discovered), they were surprised with seeing atx 
canoes of Indiana just coming on shore. They made the br way hon 

v enough ; and, giving the alarm to their comnul i-t el,..,,- all that da 

the next, going out only at night to make their obeerv y had the good luck 

- mistaken, for wherever the savages went, they did i,t ],,.d that time ,,u the i 1

While thry were l.-l.ating thus, came the three Englishmen, and, standing wi- 
the wood, whieh was new plnntcil, hallooed to them. They presently knew 
voices, and so all the wonder ceased. But n..w th. admiration was turne*!

It was not long before they brought the men in. ami in.|uiring where they had been, 
and what they had been doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in a few 
words : that th. -y reached the land in two days, or something less; but fun ling the

such as they took in the wars ; and then, they owned, they made a great feast, and ate 
their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that kind ; nd th. 
them about two noons ago, pointing to the moon and to two fingers ; and that their 
great king bed two hundred prisoners now, which he had Ul war, and they 

were feeding them to make them fat fo, foist The Kn-li-.hiM.-n seemed mi. 

ilosiiesjj of seeing those prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought they were 
desirous to have some of them to' carry away for their own eating. Ho they beckoned 
to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising ; which was to iu- 
that the next morning at sun-rising they would bring some for them ; and, accordingly, 
list next morning they brought down five women and eleven mm. and guv- th<-m to th<> 
Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows 
and oxen down to a sea-port town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their sbi. .-d.it thi-* 

sight, and they did not know what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been 
highest affront to the savage gentry that could bo offered them ; and what to do with 
them they knew not However, after some debate they resolved to accvj.t of t !. 
and, in return, they gave the savages thai brought them one of ttcheU, an old 

knifiv and six or seven of their bullets ; which, though they did not under 
their use, they seemed particularly pleased with ; and then tv ,. x>r creatures' 

hands behind them, they dragged the prisoner* into the lMt f.. r 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them, or else they 
that gave them this noble present would certainly have expected that they should have 
gone to work with them, have killed two or three of thmi ti,.- n-\t m<>n. 
perhaps, have invited the donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with all the 
respect and thanks thai could well pass between people, where, on either side, they 
esjdsrstuud not one word they could say, they )>< U their boat, and came back 

towards the first island ; when-, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at 
liberty, there bring too many of them for their occasion. 

ctr voyage they endeavoured to have some communication with their |ui*tner4 ; 
but it was impossible to make them understand anything. Nothing they could say to 
tfcen, or give them, or do for then, but was looked upon as going to murder the. 
first of all unbound then ; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the 
as if they had jusi felt the knife at their throats ; for they immediately con- 
they were unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them anything to eat, 
it was the sane thing ; they then concluded it was lor fear they should nink in flesh, and 
so not be fat enough to kill If they looked at one of then more par . ir ty 

presently concluded it was to see whether he or she was mttesA and fitt.st to kill t 
nay, afar they had brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and treat 
then well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper for th.-n new 



When the three wanderers had given this nnnooounUble history or journal of 
voyagts the Spaniard asked then where their new family w<t ; and l>cing t<>' 
they bad brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huU, and were come 
up U> beg some victuals for then, they (the Spaniards) and the other two Engli 
that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place and sec them ; and 
did* lays fiUher with then. 

Wnen they came into th<* hut, th^re they sat, all Ixtund : for when they had Im-uglit 






them on shore, they bound tlu-ir hand*, that they mi-hi not tnkc the Uut nnd make 
their escape ; them, I ar, they sat, all of them stork naked. First, there were three 
men, lusty, oottely fellow*, well-shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty t<> thii 
fire years of age; and five women, whereof two mi-ht ! from thirty t ,vo 

nir not above four or fire and twenty; an*l tin- I'lfth, a toll, comely i. 

> ur seventeen. The women were well-favoured, agreeable persons Imth in shape 
and features, only Uwny ; and two of thn.i, 1. i-l they been perfectly white, would have 
for vrry handsome women, even in I/mdon itoelf, having pleasant* agreeable 
and of a very modest behaviour ; especially when they carao afterwai 



to be cloihrd and dressed, as they called it, though that dress was very indifferent 
mot be confessed 

The sight, yoa may be sure, was something iin.-.>uth to our Spaniard*, who were, to 
ifive them a just character, men of the best behaviour, of the most calm, sedate 
and perfect good humour, that ever I met with ; an 1. n r...f th.- most modtv. 

I say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked m--n ..<..! five naked women, all 
together bound, and in the most miserable circumstance* that human nature could be 
supposed to be, viz., to be expecting every moment to be dragged out, and have ti 
brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that , for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's father, to go in, and 
see, fir*t, if he knew any of them, and th. u if ],.- understood any of their speech. As 
soon a the old man came in. he looked seriously at them, but knew none of th 
neither could any of them understand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except 
one of the women. However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy 
them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they 
abhorred eating men or women ; and that they might be sure they woul.l i,..t l 
As soon as they were assured < y discovered such a joy, and by such awkward

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask th.-:,. if 

they were willing to be servants, and to v ; mm ; . h.i-1 ).i..-i-ht them

Another observation I moat make, to the honour of a diligent application on 

raeeofa alothfol, negligent, idle temper on the other, that when I 
came to the place, and viewed the several improvements, plantings and management of 
the several little colonies, the two men had so fer outgone the three, that there was no 
They had, indeed, both of them aa much ground laid out for corn a- 
the mnoa was, because, according to n-/ hat it w** 

more corn than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultivation, 
of the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to be seen at 
imtTiow. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts, so that, when 
you came to the place nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and though they had twice 
had their jOanUtioo demolished, once by their own count M .... -n. and once by the enemy, 
aa shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and everything wai 
.* and flourishing about them: they had grapes planted in ordi-r. nml managed 
like a vineyard, though they had themselves never *xm anything of that km i . and, by 
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the other* 
TVwy hod alao found ihsmaslves out a retreat in the thickest part of the woods, wl,. r 
though there waa not a natural cave, aa 1 had found, yet they made one with incessant 
labour of their band* and where, when the mischief uh followed happened, tl,. y 
their wivte and children so as they could never be f.mud: they having, by st. 

i and poles of wood which, as I amid, grew so readily, made the grove, 
> ime places, where they climbed up to get over the outside part, 
oa by ways of their own leaving. 

Aa to the three reprobate* aa I justly call them, though they were much civilised by 
comjai-vd to what they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, 
having not the same opportunity, yet one of the certain companion* of a profligate 
mirni never left them, and that waa their idleness, It is true, they planted corn, and 
made fauces; but Solomon's words were never better verified than in them* 1 1 went 
by the vineyard of the slothful, and it waa all overgrown with thorns ;" for when the

ami there a dead bash waa crammed in, to stop them out for the piumot, 
as only ahattiof the Uble door alW the steed was stolen : whereas, when they 
looked on the cnlouy of the other two, there was the very fece of industry and success

I'.nt 1 now come to & soene difiere&l from all that had happened before, either^

all the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only

This was, without doubt, very ri-ht ; but a ,iled all ' Mires, 

and made it known an .savages that th- inhabitants there; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. After the canoes 
with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again ; and some of them 
had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to see what they had l.e,-n 
doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lyinic 
fast aleep upon the ground, It was supposed they had either been so gorged with 
their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep when the others went, or 
they bad wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time to ! taken in. 

The Spaniard* were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a loss what to 
do, Tbe SjwuUh governor, as it happened, was with them, and his advice \\as a-k.-.i. 
but he professed ho knew not what t. do. As for .slaves, they had enough already ; and 
as to killing them, there were none <-t them inclined to do that : the Spaniard governor 
told me, they could not think of ; innocent blood ; for as to them, the poor 

creature* had done them no wrong, invaded none of their pr .p.-rty. and they thought 
they had no just quarrel against them to take away their lives. And here I must, in 
justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in M.-\!.-., 
and Pern be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoe 
in any foreign country, who were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so \ 
good humoured, and so courteous, as these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had 
nothing of it in their very nature : no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passi< 
and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit Their temper and ealmn.-- had 
appeared in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three Kn-IUhmen ; and their 
justice and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages, as above. After s 
MMUltation, they resolved MI-,,, this: that they would lie still a while longer, till, if 
possible, these three men might be gone. But then the governor Spaniard recollected ' 

three savages- bad no boat; and if they were left to roam about the M.u.d. 
would certainly discover tint there were '- in it ; and so they should be 

undone thai way. Upon this, they went back again, and then 1 ,\ t fast 

aslwp still, no they resolved to awaken them, and take tiiem pi i ey did so. 

Tbe poor fellow* were strangely frightened when they were seize I 1 M >u nd ; a n I 

afraid, like the women, that they should be murdered and ea hose 

people think all the world do as they do, eating men's flesh ; but* they were soon made 
easy M to thai, and away they carried them.

much, for not a nun <>f tin -m would have escaped; but the case differed now, 

much, tor two in. -ii to fifty was too much odds. The two men had th<> happiness 

to discover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour before they landed ; 

and as they landed a mile from their huts it was some time b ; could come at 

No\v, ha\ ing great reason to believe that they were 1 they 

did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of the three men whom 

th.-y brought with tin- women (who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to lead them, 

with their two wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to the 

s in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows 
hand and foot, till they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and that they had bent 
their course directly that way, they opened the fences where the milch cows were k 
and drove them all out ; leaving their goats to straggle in the woods whither they pleased, 
that the savages might think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with 
them was too cunning for that, and gave them an account of it all, f .r they went 
directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had --cured their wive, and goods, they sent the 
other slave they had of the three who came with the women, and who was at their place 
by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire 
speedy help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms, and what ammunition they 
had, and retreated towards the place in the wood where their wives wen i'i'>g 

at a disiamv, yet so that they might see, if piible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone A ar, but that from a rising ground they could see the little army 
of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, and, in a moment n. I see 

all their huts and household stull' ilaming up together, in their great grief and mortifica- 
tion ; for they had a very great loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some time. 
They kept their station for a while, till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread 
themselves all over the place, rummaging everyway, and every place they could think 
of, in search of prey ; and in particular for the people, of \\ln>m now it plainly appeared 

they had intellL 

The two Kngli>hnien seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where they stood, 
because it was likely some of the wild people might come that way, and they might come 
too many together, thought it proper to make another retre.it about half a mile 

.'r; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther they stro!. wer 

i be together. 

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick -grown part of the woods, and 
where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree 
they both took their standing, resolving to See then- what mightoffer. They had not stood 
there li.ng before two of the savages appeared running directly that way, as if they 
alreidy had nope,- where they stood, and were coming up to attack .d a little

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand and keep 
their posture, or fly ; but, aAer a very short debate with t)u-niM?lvs they coiuidered, 
that if the savage* ranged the country thus before help mine, they might perhapa And 
oat their retreat in the woods, and thru all wouUl be lost ; no they reaolved to stand them 
there, and if they were too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the 
tw% Irom wheace they doubted not to defend themael res, fire excepted, a long as their 
ammunition mated, though all the savages that were landed, which wan near fifty, were 



to 



them. 
Having resolved upon this, 



whether they should fire at the first 



two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by v. two and the five 

that followed would be separated ; at length they resolved to 1, t il>, first two past by, 
they should spy them in the tret, and come to attack thorn. The first two 
firmed them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them towards 
another part of the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, came forward directly 
to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come to 
stiisjnl towards them, they resolved to take them in a line as they came ; and as they 
resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit thru, all th,. 
which purpose the man who was to \ line or four msll bull. -u into his piece ; 

awl having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure 
aim, without being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, to 
that he could not miss. 

While the/ were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly taw that one 
of tSe three was the runaway savage that had escaped from them ; and they both knew 
him oistmetly. and resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, U -ugh they should 
both *r : so the other sU*d ready with hi. piece, that if be did not u *p at the first 
shot, he saoald be mum to nave a second. But thr first was too good a marksman to 
miss his aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in a line, be fired, 
and hit twn of thni directly: the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head; the 
iiaaj which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and fell, but was not 
qtiat dead ; and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the tame ball 
that w*t through the body of the second ; and being dreadfully fi ;!, t.-ned, though not 
to muh hurt, sat down upon the ground, streaming and yelling in n hideous mm 

The five that were b-hrnd, more frightened with the noise than sensible 
insyr, stood still at first ; for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger than 
it rrally was, th oehoti rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 
p*rt* MTnsminjc. and every son making a different noise, according to their kind ; jmt

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



However, they made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by ; 
AIM! one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine, which he had by great chance 
in hit pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they left him and with what 
peed they cookl made after the other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any 
of them, should find their way to the covered place in the woods, where their wii 
and Ue few good* they had left lay. They came once in sight of the two men, but it 
WM at a great distance ; however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a 
valley toward* the tea, quite the contrary way from that which led to their retreat, 
which they were afraid of; and being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree 
whore they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for 
he vat gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just 
at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in at great concern as before, not knowing what course to take, or 
how near the enemy might be, or in what number ; so they resolved to go away to the 
place wjiere their wivea were, to see if all was well there, and t<> make ili.m easy, \\h> 
were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the savages were their own countrymen. 
jrrt they were moid terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge 
they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in the wood, and very n--.ii- 
that place, bat had not found it ; for it was indeed inaccessible, from the trees standing 
ao thick, anlcai the penona seeking it had been directed by those that knew it, which 
these were not ; they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 
fright. While they were here, they bad the comfort to have seven of the Span! 
come to thrir aniatance ; the other ten, with their servants, and old Friday (I mean 
Friday's &ther), were font in a body to defend their bower, and the corn ami 
that were kept there, in case the savages sh< .M have roved over to that side of the 
country ; but they did not spread so far With the seven Spaniards came one <>f the 
three aavagea, who, at I said, were their prisoners formerly ; and with th

eighth, and brought him along with them ; where, however, they were obliged t.. hind 
him again, M they had done the two others who were left when th. third ran away. 

TW prisoner* now began to be a burden t<, them ; and they were so MY.iid ..f their

knew nothing"!' tin- matt, r till all was over), came and otf, red their help and assist:, 
and .li.l. very lVi.-ii.lly, \v.,rk f..r several days to restore their habitations an.] make neces- 
saries t'.>r them. Ami thus in a little timr they were set upon their legs again. 

in's they Kail tin- farther .-at i>la .-t ion of seeing three of the 

savages' canoes come driving on shore, ami, at some distance from them, two drowned 
which they had ivason to l.,-li,-\-,. tliat they had met with a storm at sea, which 
16 of tin-in ; for it had blown very hard the night after they went off. 

lf"v. >mo illicit miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough of them escaped 

to inform the rest, as well <>( what they had done as of what had happened to them, and 
to wh-t them on to another enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, resolved 
to attempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them ; for except what the first man 
h:nl told them of inhabitants, they could say little of it of their own knowledge, for 
th.-y never >a\v one man ; and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no 
oth.r witness to confirm it to them. 

It was five or six months after this before they heard any more of the savages, in 
which time our men were in hopes they had either forgot their former bad luck, 
or given over hopes of better; when, on a s\ulden, they were invaded by a most 
formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full of savages, armed with 
b..ws and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of war; and thev 
brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost 
rnation. 

AS they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side of the island, our 
men had that ni<,dit to consult and consider what to do ; and, in the first j.la.-e, knowing 
that their being entirely concealed was their only safety before, and would be mm h 
more so now, while the number of their enemies would be so great, they therefore 
resolved, first of all, to take dnwn the huts which were built for the two Englishmen, 
and drive away their goats to the old cave; because they supjui-ed the savages would 
go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old <: im. over again, though they 
did not now land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away all the 
flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the 

.iards; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was 
possible; and the next morning early ted themselves, with all their force, at 

the plantation "f the two men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap- 
1 : these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east end of the island, .ami- 
ranging along the shore, directly towards the place, to the number <>f two hundred and 
tit'ty, as near as our men could judge. Our army was but sni.-'l. indeed ; but, that which 
was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The whole account, it 
seems, stood thus : first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday

(or Friday's father), the three slaves taken with the women, who proved very faithful, 
oil three otiMT bkvtt, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven 
muskets, f pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets or fowling-pieces, which were 
Uken by me from the mutinous teamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three old 
halberU 

To their slavee they did not give either musket or fusee ; but they had each a 
halbcrt, or a long ntuff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened into raeh 
end of it, and by his ride a hatchet ; also every one of our men had a hatchet. Two 
of th* women could not be prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight, and 
they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the 
firt action happened, which I have sjx>ken of, where the Indians fought with one 
another ; and the women had hatchets too. 

The ^p**H governor, whom I described so often, commanded the whole; and 
Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most daring, bold 
fellow, commanded under him. The savages came forward like lions; and our mm. 
which was the wotat of their fate, had no advantage in th-ir >it nation ; only that Will 
At kiits who now proved a most useful fellow, with MX mm, was planted just behind 
a mnall thicket of buxhcBS a< an advanced guard, with orders to let the first of th.-m 
pam by. and then fire into the ini<ldle of them, and as soon as he ha<l liivd, to make his 
rrtrrat a* nimbly as ho could round a part of the wood, ami so come in l>ehind the 
S|%nianU, where the/ stood, having a thicket of trees b -fore th.-m. 

When the aVlgee Ctlie on, they ran straggling al>out every way in heaps, out of 
all manner of order, and Will Atkins let aWit fifty of them pass by him ; th- 
lle rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men to lire, having loa<ll 
their muskets with nix or seven bullets upiecc, about as big as large pistol bullets. How 
many they kill.-d or wounded they knew not, but the consternation ami surprise was 

presftible among the savages ; they were frightened to the ] a >t degree to hear such 

a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, ai> hurt, but see nobody that did it ; 

when, in the middle of their fright. Will Atkins and his other three h-t fly again among

and it was observed that their wound. .1 men, who were not quite disabled, were made 
outrageous by their wound*, ami fought like madm< n. 

When our men retreated, they 1. tt the Spaniard and Englishman that were killed

Hat Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon a rising 
ground, Atkins though he was wounded, would have had them inarch and charge again 
altogether at once : hut the Spaniard replied "Seignior Atkins, you see how their 
wounded men fight ; b-t them alone till mnniing: all the wounded men will be still' 
and gore with their wounds, ami faint with the loss of blood ; and w we shall have the

Well, Seignior Atkins,'* M infaurd, f you have behaved gallantly,

Hut an it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages in great disorder 
*boqt their dead and wounded men, an<l a great noise and hurry among them where 
they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night ; especially if they could 
come t give them hut one volley before they were discovered, which they had a fair oppor

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, n ,,d then divided them-

the occasion of their coining a<^ain in siu-h multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, 
to come so many and so often as would (pute desolate ;arve them. 

Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with n 
the best counsellor in this case ; hi^ advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and 
step in l.rtween them and their beats, and so deprive them of the capa- 
MIL: any more to plague the Mand.

that they should not have any mercy, they fell to work v canoes, and destroyed 

every one thai the storm had not destroyed before ; at the sight of which the savages 
taissd a hideous rry in the woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which 
they ma about the island like distracted men, so that, iu a wor.l. ... mm <li<l not really

ftSMSilm that while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have '. 
good guard at the same time u|m their plantation* ; fr though it ia true, they had 
driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main retreat I mean

at UM bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences atxl |.'.,,,ti.,- aK

did our men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not one farthing'*. 
ofasrvioa, 

Though oar Men were able to fight them uj>on all occasions, yet they were in n 
condition to pursue then, or hunt them <> for as they were too nimble of 

foot for our men when they found them single, so our men durst not go abroad single, 
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers. The best was, they had no weapons ; 
for though they had bow*, they had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any ; 
nor had they any edge tool or weapon among them, 

Tbe mtnrmity and distress they were reduced to was great, and indeed dcplor 
but, at the same time, our men were also brought to very bad circumstances by them ; 
for though their retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, an-i 
harvest spotted, and what to do, or which way t<> turn themselves, they knc 
only rWuge tie? had now was the Hock of cattle they had in the vn cave, 

and sunw tittle corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three Englishmen,

that if any more savages came on shore they might not find one at.

they would daily hunt and lianuw them, and kill as many of them as they could come 
at, till they had reduced their number ; and if they could at last tame them, and bring 
them to anything, they would give them corn, and teach them how to plant, 
upon their daily labour. 

In order to do this, they so followed them, and so terrified them with their guns, that 
in a few days if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, y.-- 
would fall down for fear ; and so dreadfully frightened they were that th it of 

sight farther and farther ; till, at last, our men f..ll. .\\ini: them, and almost every 

g or wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places so mm h 
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food : and many wore afterwards 
found dead in the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to death. 

When our men found this it made their hearts relent, and pity m..\.-d them, espe- 
cially the S|wniard governor, who was the most gentleman-like, generous-mi t 
that I ever met with in my life ; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, 
and bring him to understand what they meant, so tar as to be able to act as interpreter,

; to those people, because we furnished th.-m with 

s, scissors, spa -kaxes, and all things of that kind which they 

.. With the help of those tools, they were so very handy that they came at last to 
build up their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up like basket- 
work all tin- way round ; which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
l>i it was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts of 
v.-nnin : an.l our in.-n were so taken with it, that they got the wild savages to come 
In tin- liki- for them ; so tint when I came to see the two Eu^lUli!. :iies,

these them was a door ; first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, another door 
into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk that was round it ; so that 
walk was aim divided into six equal parts, which served not only lor a retreat, but to 
tore up any necessaries which the family had occasion for. These six spaces not taking 
up the whole circumference, what other apartments the outer circle had were thus 
ctJafd : At 10011 AH you were iu at the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage

feet wide and about thirty feet long, and through that into another not quite so long, 
o that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come

though I cannot repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I rememU-r 1

their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape.

Upon these frank and opi-n Miip, w ajipnin t,-,l lay to

his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and tin- old cook's mate we had on shore 

assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of 

the ship's i : vith our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; and, in particular, I 

cm ten l> and ten bottles of KnglUh beer; things that

the cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered up close, ou board tho 

the seamen, tl fresh meat from on shore, as we did with 

alt meat from on board.

be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, an- ;. \ e, of great learning. 

H-- gave me a mo-t diveiting aee..unt of his lite, and ot

been abroad in the world i.-ularly it was very remarkable, th voyage 

he was now engaged in, he had the mi-fortun 1 and unshipped, 

go to the place whither any of the ships he was in at first designed. 
his first intent was to have gone to Martini.-.., : md that lie went on board a ship bound 
but, being forced into |.i-b.,i, by bad weather, the ship received 
running aground in the mouth of the river Ta-_ r u-. and was obliged to 
unload her cargo there ; but finding a Portuguese ship there bound to the Madeiras, and 
to sail, and supposing ho should . <sel there bou 

he \rvut mi board, in order to sail to the Madeira* : but the master of the 1 
guese sliip, being but an indifferent mariner, had been out of his reckoning, and they 
drove to Fyal ; v \ ever, he happened to find a very good mark cargo, 

whieh was corn, and therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at 
the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this exigence 
but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far as the banks (so they call 
the place wl itch the fish), where, meeting with a French ship bound from France 

to Quebec, in th> Canada, and from thence to Marti nico, to carry 

ight he should have an opportunity to complete his first design : but when he 
came to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel procoede 
the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned when we 
took them up at >ra, ami then shipped with us f,,r the Ku^t Indies, ;w I have already 

Thus he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may cab

I shall not make digression into other men's stories, which have no relation to

I beseech you, flatter not yourself that yon are not, therefore, under an obligation to do 
your utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think but that, let the time past 
lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the futun-, will lie entirely upon you ? because ii is 
certainly in your power now to put an enl to it, and in nobody's power but yours." 

I wa no dull Ktill that I did not understand him right ; but I imagined that, by 
jprUl^g n end to it, he meant that I should part them, and not suffer them to live 
together any longer; and I said to him I could not do that by any means, for that 
would put the whole island into confusion, lie seemed surprised that I should so far 
mintake him. ** Xo, sir," says he, I do not mean that you should now separate them, 
bat legally ami effectually marry them ; and as, sir, my way of marrying them may not 
beeaty to reconcile them to, though it will be etVcetual, even by your own laws, so your 
way may be an well before God, and as vali>l among men. I mean by a written con- 
tract, ftigntd by both man and woman, and by all the v i .resent, which all the 
lawn of Europe would decree to be valid." 

I was amaxed to see so much true pi'-ty. and so much sincerity of zeal, lie-id. - the 
unusual impartiality in his discourse as to hi- ,, wn party or church, and such true 
warmth for prencrving the people, that he had no knowledge of or relation to ; I say, 
far preserving them from transgressing the laws of God, the like of which I had, indeed, 
Mi met with anywhere. But recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a 
written contract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him. and 
Cold him I granted nil that he had .-aid to l><- ju>t, and on his part very kind : that I 
would discourse with the men upon the point now, when I came to them ; and I knew 
why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew well 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in England as if they w< i. mar 
lied bj one of our own clergymen What was afterwards done in this matter, I shall 
peak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he ha 1 t<> make, 
acknowledging that I was very much his debtor for tl d thanked him heartily 

He told me be would use the same freedom and plainness in the second, ami 
hoped I would take it an well ; and thin was, that notwitii>tunding these English sul 
of mine, as he called them, had lived with these women almost seven years, had taught 
them to speak English and even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women 
of tolerable understanding, and capable ,. yet they had not, to this },, -, 

taught them anything of the Christian religion no, not so much a t here 

WAA a God, or a womhip, or in what manner God was to be served, or that their own 
idolatry, and worshipping they k> h..m, was false and abau 

was an unaccountable msjcrt, and what God won dl them to account 

and prrhapft at but tako the work out of their hands. I < toly 

and warmly. " I am persuaded," says 1. -hose men 'he savage country 

whence their wives came, the savages would have taken more {wins to have brought 
them to be idolaters, and to worship the devil, f f these men, so far as I can 

see, have taken with them to teach thnn the knowledge of the true God. Now, i 
aid be, "though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad 
to see the deviTe servant*, and the subject* of his kingdom, taught to know thn general 

iples of the f religion; that they might, at leant, h-

I went from their quarter they all eame to pie, and told me they had I'e.-n 
what I had mid ; that they \v,,.- -lad to hear 1 had a clergyman in my 
company, and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, ami to ! 
formally married sn Hoon as I pleased; for they \\ ! far from desiring to part with 
their wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest when they , > 
them. So I u|i|tointed them to meet m- the next morning; and, in the mean' 
they fthmild let their wive* know the meaning of the marriage, law ; and that it was not 
only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made senHihle of the memingof the thing, and were rerj 
w.-|| mtiftfied with it, a-, indeed, th.-y had reason to be : so they failed not to attend 
altogether at my a|rtim nt n< \t mornini.'. where 1 ln-ought ont my clergyman ; and 
though he had nt mi a minister's gown, after the manner of Knglaml, or the haliit of a 
priest, after the manner of France, yet having a black vest something like 
with a a.-h round it, he did imt look very unlike a minister ; and as for his lanu'ua- i 
was his interpreter. But the seriousness of his l.eha\ -iour to them, and the scruples he 
made of marrying the women, because they were not baptised and professed < 'hristians 
gave them an exceeding reverence for his JM-IHOII ; and there \\ax n.. need.

be will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the" while, and who, we 
flpqH easily perceive, waa more than ordinarily atfeet. d with it ; when being eager, 
and hardly Buffering me to make an end " I know all this, master," says he, "and a 
great deal more; but 1 have not tin- impudence to talk thus to my wife, when CJ...I and 
my conacience know, and my wife will be an undri.iahle e\idem-e against me, that I 
have liveil ait if I had never heard of a Cod or future state, or anything about it ; and 
to talk of my repenting, alas! (and with that he fetched a deep si^h, and [ could seo 
that the tears stood in hut eyes) *tb past all that with m-." " J'ast it, Atkins / " said I : 
h.t doxt thou mean by that?'* " I know well enough what I mean," says he ; "I 
mean 'tis too kte, and that in too tru. -." 

I toM the clergyman, word for won 1, \\hat he said : the pour, /ralmis priest I must 
rail him no, for, be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular affection 
for the good of other men's souls, and it would be hard to thin'.c he had not the like 1-r 
ht own I say, this affectionate man could not refrain from tears ; but, recovering hi m- 
rlf t vid to me, '* A*k him but om> question. Is he easy that it is too late ; or is he 

.bird, and wide- it were not so /" I put the cpie-tiou fairly to Atkins; nnd he 
answered, with a great deal of passion, "How could ny man he easy in a condition that 
munt certainly i.d in eternal destruction? that he was far from being easy ; but that, 
on the contrary, he believed it would one time or other ruin him." " What do you 

meaii bv that I" -aid I. "Why," In- said. "In- heli--\-d he -hoiild one time or other 

i. t, to put an i.d t. tin- terror of it." 

The clergyman shook his head, with gnat eoneern in his face, when I told him all 
hut turning quiek to me U|MUI it, -a\ , " 1 1 that be hi- Case, We may as>ure him it 
Mni-t will gi\e him repi-ntane<. I'.ut pray," says he, "explain this to 
him ; that as no man i* saved but by <'hri>t, and the merit of his passion proem-ing 
hivine merey f.-r him, how i-an it be too late for any man to reeeive m. iw I \ )..

I told Atkins nil tin-, and he heard me uith u''. : b.it it 1 

he tiirni-d nfF the di-nuirsi- to the rest, for he said to me. In- \\<>uld .;. an<l liave -

Upon thU discourse, however, ami their promising, as abo\ loavour to per-

A tfoou a* thi* WHJ* over, we married them ; and after tin- marriage was over, he 
to Will Atkuus and iu a vcr\ affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to per- 
..! tn that good ilU|HwiUon ho wa.s in, but to support the convictions that wore upon 
him bv a rtwolution to reform his life; told him it was in \aiu t say he repented if he 
did not fonake hw crime* : repretieuted to him how God had honoured him with being 
th. instrument uf bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and that 
he should lie careful he should not dishonour the grace of (Jod ; and that if he did, In- 
would m the hen then a better t'hristian than himself ; the savage converted, and the 
instrument ca^t nwav. He aid a great man\ good things to them both; and then, 
rnonmaiilltim ^ tem * God's goodness, gave them the benediction again, I repeating 
vtT>-Uiing to them ill English ; and thu> en. led the <-nvm..iiy. 1 think it was the m<t 
(Icaoaiit and agtveable day to me that ever I passed in my \vh.le life. 

But my clergyman had not donr \.-t : hi- thoughts hung continually upon the eoii- 
wnkm of the thirty-oveu wvagea, and fain he would have stayed upon the i>land to 
\\A\V iindertakeu it ; but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking \\as impracticable 
in itaelf ; and, mjcondly, that )ierhap- I \\ould put it into a way of being done in liis 
abMttce to bin attUfaction. 

Having thtiM brought the aflaii-> o| th, inland to a narrow eompa.-s, I was preparing 
. _. . .:._ U II MJ t,d.< ', Oll< Of the fami-hed shi|''> 

ioiu|wny oiuie in iut% id told me he uiidn *[*{ 1 had a -lergynian with me, and that I 
liad CMit.M.tl thu Kngli-lnm-n t-> le married to the hat he had a match too, which 

in-.l uii-ht in- tinixhed let>re 1 went, ln-tueen two Christians, which he hoped would 
diMtgrevuble t<> 

I knew thi> mu.-t In- th- \ouiiu' woman who \\a-> his motlier'-^ servant, for there was 
no other < 'In i^ti.tn woman on the inland : io I began to perguade him not to do anything 
of that kind ranlily, or because lie f..und himself in this solitary circumstanee. I repi-e- 

ented to him that he had HOI < in the \\->rld, and good frien-l- 

an 1 ttndentood by hiin.M It. and the m.iid also ; that the maid was not only poor, and H 

^.u unequal to him. >h' l-ing -i.\ or level] and twenty years old, and he not 

above cvvotecn or eighteen : tli.it h- might \rr\- pmliahly. with my assistance, make a 



tliw wildernebH, .. .nto hi> own country again ; and that then it would 

be a Uxnuand to one but he would rep.-nt his choice, and the dMike of that circumstance 
might be diwlvantageouji to 1-th 1 \\.i-. going to my m..r.-. but he intei rupte.l me,

customary barbariti*-*, they might come and go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody 
would disturb them ; and they were often ahore, and went away agm,

.-ix- all I'tot^t-tiiU ; Hud u. recommended it earnestly to them, and made them 
promise that they would never make any distinction of Papist or Protest 
tfceir exhorting the savages to turn Chri*tians, but teach them the general knowledge 
of tbe true God, and of their Saviour Jems Christ; and they likewise promised ns that 
they would never have any differences or disputes one with another about religion.

young woman I have mentioned above and Will Atkin-% wife were became intimates ; 
and this prudent, religions young woman bad perfected tbe work Will Atkins bad begmi ; 
and though it was not above four days after what I have related, yet tbe new-baptised 
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have seldom beard of in all my oleiia-

myself leas considering for them than my good friend the widow was for me when she

religion together for Will At I - me with a great deal of joy I asked if they 

were together now, and be aril, vex ; so I went into the house and be with me, and we 
found them together very earne* in discourse. " Oh, air,** aays Will Atkins, - when

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



and use them kindly. I could have procured more women, but I remembered that the 
poor prosecuted man had two daughters, and that there were but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted the rest had wives of their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome to mv 
old inhabitant*, who were now, with this addition, between sixty ami seventy people, be 
little children, of which tin-re were a great many. I found letters at London from them 
all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England, of which I shall also take some 
notice immediately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about it : and whoever 
reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, 
and expect to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much lesa 
by those of other men, to beware : not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and dis- 
appointments ; not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, nor made cautious by 
afflictions and distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full liberty has to go 
to the turnkey at Newgate and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there, and 
-tarve him. Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone directly to the island ; 
had 1 loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, and 
for my people ; taken a patent from the Government here to have secured my property 
in subjection only to that of England ; had I carried over cannon and ammunition, 

uits and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified and strengthened 
it in the name of England, and increased it with people, as I might easily have done ; 
had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might 

have done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again 
foiL our supply, had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a 
man of common sense : but I was possessed of a wandering spirit, and scorned all advan- 
tages : I pleased myself with being the patron of the people I placed there, and doing for 
them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing for 
them as if I had been father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation : but 1 never 
BO much as pretended to plant in the name of any government or nation, or to acknow- 
ledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation more than another : nay, 
I in -vi T s<> much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it, belonging to nobody, 
and the people under no discipline or government but my own; who, though I had in- 
lluence over them a a father and benefactor, had no authority or power to act or com- 
mand one way or "ther, farther than voluntary consent mo ved them to comply; \<t 
e\eu this, had I >t a\ I t here, would have done well enough : but as 1 rambled from them 
and rame there no more, the last letters I had from any f them were bv my partner's 
means, who aft i wards sent another sloop to the place, and whosent me word, though I 
had not the letter till I got to London, several years after ii wa- written, that they went 
on l>ut poorly; were discontent with their long stay there ; that Will Atkins was ,1 
that five of the Spaniards were come away ; and though they had not been much mo], 
by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with them ; and that they 1. egged of 
him to write to me to think of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that they 
might see their country again before they died. 

I was gone a wildgoose chase indeed ! and they that will have any more of m> 
"in ' nt to follow me into a new variety of follies, hardship.-., and wild adventures, 

wherein the justice of Providence may be duly observed; and we may see how easily 

VGQ. am gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishs be our 



VOYAGE TO THE EAST INDIMS. 



atlliction, ami punish us i .-ly wiih tli.,.,- \,-r\ tiling- which w.- think it would he 

our utmost happiness to be allowed in. Whether I had l.u ty I 

went : it is no time now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of m\ own conduct 
but to come to the history, I was embarked for the voyage, and the 

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest I'.. pish ch-r^man ; f,,r let 
their opinions of us, and all other heretics in general. 11 tlfl, bead un> harital.h- 

as it may, 1 verily believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good of all men : 
yet I believe In- was upon (he it-serve in many of i. 

me offence ; for I scarce heard him once call on the Biassed Virgin. r un-mion 3 
or his guardian angel, though so common with the rest of them : boweveY, I say, I had 
not the least doubt of his sincerity and pious intentions; and 1 am lirmly of o pinion, 
if the rest of the Popish missionaries were like him, they would strive to tin- 

poor Tartars and Laplanders, where they have nothing to give them, as well as c 
to Hock to India, Persia, China, Arc., the most wealthy of the heathen countries ; for if 
they expected to bring no gains to their church by it, it may well be admired how 
they came to admit the Chinese, Confucius into the calendar of the Christian saints. 

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me leave to go thither : 
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he began. How happy it 
had been for me if I had gone with him ! But it was too late now : all things Heaven 
appoints for the best: had I gone with him, I had never had so many tilings to be thankful 
for, and the reader had never heard of the second part of the travels and adventur- 
Robinson Crusoe; so I must here leave exclaiming at myself, and go on with my 
voyage. From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good 
Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally south-east, now and then a 
storm, and some contrary winds : but my disasters at sea were at an end, my future 
rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land AVI. 
well prepared to be our scourge as the sea. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who wa> to 
direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain 
number of days for stay, by charter-parly, at the several ports she was to go to. This 
was none of my business, neither did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and 
the supercargo, adjusting all those things between them as they thought fit. 

We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take in fresh water, but made 
tne best of our way for the coast of Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a 
French man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for the 
Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with France., I had some apprehension* of them ; 
but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester th'e reader with a tedious description of places, journals of our 
voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds, <fec. ; it is enough to name 
the ports and places which we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passage 
from one to another. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though 
the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed with lances and bows, 
which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile ; 
they treated us very civilly ; and for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, 
scissors, tkc., they brought us eleven good fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took 
in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to salt for the 
ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished ourselves with

While we were dealing with him for our .j.iuui, it came into my head that 
he wi:;hi |erhapai il--.il lor tli- >hip, t"", and I ordered tin- interpreter t<> jro|,,,x,. 
it lo him ; he shrunk up hi shoulders at ii. when it was first pmpo.srd to him; 
but IU n few he came t" me, with one ol' tin- missionary priests f,,r his 

i interpreter, aud told me he had a propo.-al to make to me, which was this : he had 
bought a great quantity of go< \\ln-iihi-hail no thoUghta of proposals made to 

him ot' iuving the ship ; ami that, therefore, he had not money to pay for tlie sliip ; 
i!' I Would' let the Stunt* men who were in the ship navigate her, lie would hire the 
to go to Japan ; and would send them from thenee to the Philippine Islands with 
Another loading, which he would pay the freight of before they went from .Japan ; and 
that at tlieir ivturn he would buy the ship. 1 began to listen to his proposal, and so 
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a 
_'ing myself with him, and so to set sail from the Philippine Islands away to 
- mth Seas ; aeeordingly, I asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us 
t the 1'hilippim- Inlands and discharge u> there. lie said no, he could not do that, 
then he could not have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, 
at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, ynd p>ing 
myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the 
dangers as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and tivach. . 
|*'op|.. ; lik.-\\i>e those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, eruel, and 
treacherous than t!. 

I5ui to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion ; the first thing we had t" 
ill with the captain of the ship, and with his men, and know if they 
were willing to go to Japan ; and while I was doing this, the young man whom my 
nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels came to me, and (old me that 
h" thought that voyage promised very fail-, and that there was a great JM-. 
advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if I \\--.uld not, and 
would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or as I pleased to order him 

he came to Kngland, and I was there and alive, ho would rend, r i lifnl 

,nt of hi- sue. -ess, which should be as much mine as I pleased. ' dly loth 

ft \\ith him ; but considering the prospect of advantage, which ivall\ 
able, and that he \v.^ a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any 1 knew. I inoll] 
to J.-t him go; but I told him I would consult my {Nirtner, and JIV6 him an ai. 

My partner ami 1 <1 about it, and m\ 

g.-ii.-r..ns otl'ei- : "You know it lias been an unluel;

for travellers ; but nothing \\a- more awkward to me than to see 
such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the mid>t of the grossest simplicity and 
ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to ! very merry upon these 
occasion*, to ce the beggarly pride of these people. !',.] example, coming by the house 
of a country gvutleman, as Father Simon called him, alout ten leagues off the city of 
Nanquin, we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house about two 
miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of po:up 
and poverty. His habit was very proper for a scaramouch, or men -y-andrrw, being a 
dirty calico, with hanging tdeeves, tassels, and cuts and .slashes almost on every side : it 
eorwml a taflety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which testified that his honour must 
U a moat exquisite sloven. His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling creature, ami Ji- 
had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the po,. along ; he had a whip 
in his hand, and he bolahonrnd the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about 
At tail; and thus he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servant-, -oing from the 
city to hts country seat about half a league before u-. \\ . travelled on gently, but 
Hii figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; and as we stopped at a vill.i 
an hoar 10 r< fresh us, when we came by the country ---at of this great man, we saw him 
in a little (dace before his door, eating a repast It was a kind of garden, but he was 
asy to he teen ; and we were given to understand that the more we looked at him the 
r br would be pleased. He sat under a tret-, something like the palmetto, which 
effectually shaded him ..\, r the head, and on the south side ; but under the tree was 
placed a large umbrella, which mad. that part look well enough. He Kit lolling back 
in a great elbow-chair. U-ing a heavy, corpulent man. ami had his meat brought him by 
ii-. . II- had two more, one of whom fed the squire with a spoon, and the 

other held thf dih with QSJC hand, and scraped oil* what he let fall upon his worship's 
. ., ,. . 

Thus leaving the poor wretch t please himself with our looking at him . if ire 
dbni nip. though we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued our journey ; 

only Father Simon had the curiosity to st.iy to inform hi-nself what dainties the country 
jsjstki had to feed on in all his state, which he had the h..nou .f. and which 

was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag 
with gn- ...other plant which they have tl hin- like our

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



The road all on this aide of the country is very populous, and is full of potters and 
.u th- makers that is to say, people that temper the earth for the China ware ; and as 
I IT*H coming along, our Portugal pilot, who had always something or other to say to 
make us incm . eering to me, and told me he would show me the- greatest rarity 

in all the country, and that I should have this to way of China, after all the ill-humoured 
things that I had said of ii, that I had seen one thing which was nob to be seen in all 
the world beside. I was very importunate to know what it was ; at last he told me it 
was a gentleman's house built with China ware. " Well," says I, "are not the materials 
of their buildings the product of their own country I and so it is all China ware, is it 
not f " "No, no," says lie, " I mean it is a house all made of China ware, such as you 
call it in England, or ag it is called in our country, porcelain." " Well," says I, " such 
a thing may be. How big is it ? Can we cany it in a box upon a camel ? If we cai., 
we will luty it." "Upon a camel !" says the old pilot, holding up both his hands : 
' \\hy, there i> a family of thirty people lives in it." 

I then curious, indeed, to see it; but when I came to it, it was nothing hut 
it was a timW house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and 
plaster ; but all this plastering was really China ware that is to say, it was plastered 
with the earth that makes China ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, 
wan glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the 
large China ware in England is painted, and hard as if it had been burned. As to the 
in-i-lc, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, 
like the little square tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China, 
and the figures exceedingly fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed 
with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being 
m.idc of the Ham-- earth, that it was very hard t<. see where the tiles met. The floors of 
the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in 
tueinttcver.il parts of England ; a> hard M stone, and smooth, but not burned and 
painted, except name smaller rooms like closet N which were all, as it were, paved with 
th<- ceiling and all the plastering work in the whole house were of the 
MOM earth . an 1. after all, the r. .\,-ivd with tiles of the, .same, but of a deep

the wonder of the world, was mightv eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it 
a most excellent thing to keep out the Tartars; which lie happ 
meant it, and so took it for a compliment ; but the old pil" 1 

In-]. be, "you speak in colours." -In colon: I b do you mean

l.y that, it is g l for nothing but to keep out Tartar. 1 understand yon, Seignior 

Inglese, I understand you; but Seignior Chinese un<i . "ii his own v. 

\\eil," Myfl I, "seignior, do you think it would stand out an army of our country 

people, with a go. id train of artillery '? or our engineers, with two OOmpfiniefl of miners ? 

\Vould not they batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia 

blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there should .unfit 1 : 

" A . n he, - 1 know that/' The Chinese wanted mightily to know wi 

and I gave him leave to tell him a few <la\ s after, for we were then almost out off 

country, and he was to leave us a little time after this ; but when ho knew wi. 

he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his tine story oi 

Chinese power and greatness while he stayed. 

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like the Pins' wall, 

inoiis in Northumberland, built by the Komans, we began tolind the country thinly 
inhabited, "and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns ..r citie^, MS heing 
subject to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and 
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country. And here 
I began to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we travelled, f.-r ^ 

il troops of Tartar, mving about ; but when I came t<> see them distinct 
wondered more that the Chine-,- Kmpiiv could be conquered by such contemptible 
fellows ; for they are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no ..id, r. and understanding 
no discipline or manner of light. Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, 
and lit for nothing ; and tlris we found the first day we s ;l w them, which was aft. : 
entered tin- wilder part of the country. Our leader for the day gave leave for ;i 
^ixteen of us to go a-hunting as they call it ; and \\hat was this |, u t hunting .>! sheep ! 
However, it may lie called hunting, too, f ,r the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of 

thai ever I saw of their kind : only they will not run a great w.< . ; are sure 

of sport when you begin the chase, for they apjiear generally thirty or forty in ;i ilock, 
and, like true sheep, always keep together when they fly.

stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showing the face of any 

order at all ; hut as MM.II a> tln-y saw us advance, they let fly their arrows, which, how- 
. . , v happily : it seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance ; 
f.r tl, rir arrows all fell a little >hrt of us, but with so true an aim, that had we been 
about twentv \aids nearer, we must, have had several men wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance. \\ e tired, and sent 
thi'ln leaden bullets f,,r wooden arrows, following our shot full-gallop, to fall in among 
them sword in hand for so our hold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a 
merchant, but he behaved with such vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with 
vieh c.M.l outrage too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As soon 
as we e.une tip to them, we tired our pistols in their faces, and then drew ; but they fled 
in the greatest confusion imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on our 
rigl't, where t'uree of' them .stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come back to them, 
having a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Our 
brave OOOimandef, without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to them, and 
with his fusee knocks one of them oft' his horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the 
third ran away ; and thus ended our fight ; but we had this misfortune attending it, 
th; t all our mutton we had in eha> got aw:iy. We had not a man killed or hurt ; but 
: the Tartars, then- were about live of them killed ; how many were wounded we 
knew not; but this we knew, that the other party were so frightened with the noise of 
our guns, that they made otl', and ne\er made any attempt upon us. 

W.- \\ere all this while in the Chineae dominions, and therefore the Tartars were not 
rwards ; but in about five days we entered a vast, great, wild de>ert 
which lnld us three days and nights' march ; and we were obliged 'to carrv our water 
with us, in gre ; ,t leathern Lotties, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard they 
do in the de>ert of Arabia. 

I a-ked our guides whose dominion this was in, and they told me this was a kind of 

bonier, that might be called n< man's land, being a part of (1 real Karakathy, or Grand 

iiy ; that, however, it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but that then- was no 

care taken here to i tr<'iii the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned 

the v. iii the whole, march, though we were to go over some much lar. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me, we saw, two or 

three times, little parties of t 1 . Init they seemed to be upon their own affairs, 

and to hav n design ujoii Us ; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they had 

. we had nothing to say to them : wo let them go. Once, however, 

a pin in came .8O HIM md and ga/.e, at us : whether it was to consider 

if thry ulioiild attack u-< <T n-.:. ire knew not ; l.iit when we had passed at tOUM distance 
by them, we i ..f forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the

only we found they saluted u* with live arrows at then pan ing. which w..nnded a 1.

and his horse standing very quietly by him : anl, looking farther, I saw my champion 
and deliverer, who had ' what the Chinese had done, coining hack with liis 

hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me en my feet, came running to me, and 
cinl.racrd me with a great deal of joy, being atVaid l.et'ore that I had Keen killed ; and 
seeing me bloodv, would see how I wa> hurt : hut it waH not inueli, only what we rail 
a broken head : neither did I afterwards tind any great inconvenience from the blow, 
for it was well again in two or thn , da\ l 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory. fr we lust a camel and gained a 
home. But that which was remarkable, when we came l.aek t.. the village, the man 
demanded to be paid for the camel; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
lefore tie .if the plat . To give him his due, he acted with a great deal 

of prudrne.- and impartiality ; and, having heard both sides, lie gravely asked the 
< 'hinese man that went with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was 1 "I am no 
.nt," ays lie, "hut went with the stranger." "At whose request?" says the justice. 

he. ' Why, then," ays the justice, "you were the 

I servant for the time; and the camel being delivered to his servant, it 
delivered to him, and he must pay for it" 

I coi.fe>> the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say ; but, admiring to see 

-ii, -li just reasoning njwm the consequence, and an accurate stating of the case, t paid 

.igly for th<- cam.], and sent for another; but, you may observe, I did not go to 

my more, for I had had enough of that. 

The city of Xauin is a frontier of the Chinese Empire ; they call it fortified, and so 

i- fortification* go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in 

Inch, I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the walls with 

their b..ws an,] arrows ; but to call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be

that he w just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and Wing

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they were; how 
i -1, but ten thousand, we thought, was the least ; a party of them 

cmmt on fiwt, ftnd viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our 
tine* and, as we found them within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to 
advance swiftly, and give them as ich wing with their shot, which was done ; 

and they went off, I suppose bock, to give an account of the reception they were 
like to meet with ; 1. that salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately 

halted, stood awhile to consider it. and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their 
design, and said no more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our cir- 
cnmxUnces, which were but very indifferent for a battle with such a number. 

Two days after, we came to the city of Nairn, or Naum : we thanked the governor 

for hi* care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts,

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



built in M many places as it is possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, 
something like the stationary soldier* placed by tin- Romans in the remotest countries 
of their empire ; some of which I had r--a 1 't* were placed in Britain, for tlie security 
of commerce, and for the lodging of travellers : and thus it was here ; for wherever we 
cmrae, though at these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians 
and pcotaed Chriltiann. yet the inhabitants were mere jm^ins ; sacrificing to idols, 
and worshipping the *un, moou, and stars, or all the host of heaven ; and not only so, 
but were, of all the heathens and pagans that .-v.-r 1 met with, the most barbarous, 
except onlv that they did not eat men's flesh, as our savages of America did. 

Some instances of Urn we met with in the country between Arguna, where we enter 
tbe Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together, called NWtzi- 
eoaky, in which is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel 
over. In a Tillage near the last of these places, I had the curiosity to go and see 
their way of tiring, which is most brutish and insufferable. They had, I suppose, a 
great Mcrifice that day; for there stood out, upon an old .stump of a tree, an idol made 
of wood, frightful ns tip- d.-vil ; at least as anything we ran think of to represent the 
devil ean be made ; it had a head not resembling any creature that the world e\ er saw ; 
ean as big as goats* bonus and as high; eyes as big as a crown piece ; a nose like a 
crooked ram*s horn, and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion, with hor- 
rible teeth, booked like a parrot's under bill : it was dressed up in the filthiest manner 
that you eould suppose; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward : 
a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through it: it was about 
tigbt feet high, yet IMS! no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of parts. 

TUs scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village ; and when I came near 
. there were sixteen or seventeen creatures whether men or women I could not 
teil, for they made no distinction by their habits all lying flat upon the ground round 
tbw formidable block of shapeless wood ; I saw no motion among them, any more than 
if th*jr bad been all logs of wood, like the idol, and at first f really thought they had 
be* so; but when I eame a little nearer, they started up uj:i their feet, and raised a 
bowling cry. a* if it had been so many d |i-mutln- 1 h<.unds and walke 1 away, aa it' 
.Hay Wrrr dUplm***! at our diHturbin^ them. A little way ..u" from the idol, and at the 
door of trni or but, malf nil >f *h.-.-|. -kin, and oow-sktna dried, stood th ! i.ut. 1 

tbowgbt tbey were wirh when I came nearer to them, for 1 found they had long

nay, I could see in 1 u-e that what I said put his spirit* into an exceeding

, and, as it were, hesitated what he would say to it : but, after he had 

paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures 

as we are, that even our greatest acts of fi-i.-n-Uhip are made snares unto us, and we are 

made tempters of one another ! My dear friend," said he, " your offer is so sincere, has

incognito into our apartment, and his father presented him to me ; and, in short, we 
concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, and 
oeh other fun as are very rich hi that city, in exchange for some of the goods I had 
brought from China; in particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the 
greatest part here, and the reat afterwards at Archangel, for a much better price than I 
could hav got at Irfflffrr ; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose 
business niore particularly than mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our 
May, on account of the traffic we made h< 

It was the beginning of June when I 1 mote place ; a city, I believe, little 

beard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so far out of the road of commerce, that 1 
know not now it should be much talked of. We were now reduced to a very small 
, having only thirty -two horses and camels in all, and all of them passed f< >r miin. 
my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them ; it was most natural, also, that 1 
bould take more servants with me than I had before ; and the young lord paa- 
my steward ; what great man I passed for myself, I know not, neith- ncern 

me to inquire. We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass ov.-r that we met 
with ia our whole journey ; I call it the worst because the way was very d.-.-j. in some 
place* and very uneven in others ; the beet we had to say for it was, that . thought 
w* had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear, and that ih.-y never came on this side 
the rirrr Oby. or at least very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly acquaint, d with 
f, and led w by private roads, so that we avoided coming into the prim ij il 
towme and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen, Soloy Kamskoi, and several 
others; bicauss tne Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and 
rtrmtiutkmi iilm luljinupon travellers, and searching lest any ..i th. banished penont 
of Mle should make their escape that way into Muscovy ; but, by this means, as we 
kept out of the cities, to our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged to 
and lie in our tenta, when we might have had very good accommodation m th- 
on the way; tab the young lord was to tenmble of that he would not allow us to 
tie abroad when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself; with hi, 
servant, m the woods, and met us always at the appointed placet. 

We bad just entered Europe, having named the river Kama, which in these parts it 
the boundary between Europe and Ami, and the first city on the European side was

were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at fint about forty-five in 
number; th. v came n n. u to us as to be within two musket-shots, and, asking no 

questions, suiT.'iindrd us with their hor.M-s ami lo<.k-.l very earnestly upon us twice ; at 
length, they plaeed tlii-n: ir way ; upon which we drew up in a little line, 

before our <.m BIM in all ; ami, Iwin^ drawn up thus, we 

halted, ami sent OUl rvant, wlm attended his h.nl, to 8C6 who they were ; 

f was the more willing to let him _ In- was not a little appn-hensive 

wen- a Siberian troop >ent out after him. The man came up nearer them 

with a flag of truce, ami called to them ; but though he spoke several of their languages, 

I- dialects of languages rather, he could n a word they said ; how. 

after MS to him not to come near them at his peril, the fellow came back no 

t than he "iily that by their dress, he said, he believed them to be some 

: Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes, and that there must be more of them 
upoi, n, though he never heard that any of them were seen BO far north 

About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and rode round our 
little wood to see where they might break in ; but finding us always ready to face them, 
they went oil* again ; and we resolved not to stir for that night. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no remedy ; there was, on our left 
hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a little grove, and very near the road ; I 
immediately resolved we should advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as 
v,'Q could there ; for, first, I considered that the trees would in a great measure cover us 
from their arrows ; and, in the next place, they could not come to charge us in a body ; 
it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency 
attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in 
cases of the most danger. We advanced immediately, with what speed we could, and 
gained that little wood ; the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, 
keeping their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we 
found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece of ground, and on the one 
side a very great spring of water, which, running out in a little brook, was a little 
farther joined by another of the like size ; and was, in short, the source of a considerable 
river, called afterwards the Wirtska ; the trees which grew about this spring were not 
above two hundred, but very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, 
we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they attacked us on foot. 

While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours, without 
peiveivini,' that they made any m<> \ement, our Portuguese, with some help, cut several 
arms of trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in a 
manner fenced us in. About two hours before niu r ht, they came down directly upon us; 
and though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined by some more, so 
that they w<-re near four-core horse; whereof, however, we fancied some were women. 
They . ame on till they were within half-shot of our little wood, when we fired one 
musket without ball, and called to them in tl.- 1 n tongue, to know what they 

wanted, ami bade them keep otf ; but they came on with a double fury up to the wood 
side, not imagining we were so barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old 
pilot was our captain, as well as our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till 
they came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill, and that when we did fire 
we should be sun; to take good aim; we bade him give the word of command, which he 
delayed so long, that they were some of them within two pikes' length of us when we
