 PREFACE. 
 
 
 THE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the 
 study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi- 
 ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the 
 thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture, 
 can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary- study for 
 young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as 
 a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it 
 is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and 
 ready students of mathematics are those who have been most 
 thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic. 
 
 This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes, 
 and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the 
 primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written 
 arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer- 
 cised in this branch of study. 
 
 Only a few of the many points of difference between this and 
 other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior 
 to them, will be referred to. 
 
 It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive In its char- 
 acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys- 
 tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical 
 science. The development of principles, and their applications, 
 are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of 
 appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with 
 those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com- 
 plex and difficult. 
 
 At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap- 
 ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles, 
 and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every 
 principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough 
 review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what 
 he has been over. 
 
 One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most 
 original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and 
 uniform system of ANALYSIS it contains, the result of long expe- 
 rience in the school-room. 
 
 Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per- 
 centage, and Interest ; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to 
 obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the 
 operations in them.

4 PREFACE. 
 
 The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable 
 and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge- 
 bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they 
 may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every 
 principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions 
 of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult 
 fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy. 
 
 In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belie'f, that 
 in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long 
 sought in this department of science, the means of mental dis- 
 cipline and development such as has been furnished by uo 
 similar treatise. 
 
 THE AUTHOR. 
 
 SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
 
 Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be 
 classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the 
 class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine 
 their lesson before being called upon to recite. 
 
 The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly 
 prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons 
 in the latter part of the work. 
 
 Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly, 
 the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand 
 erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will 
 secure close attention. 
 
 Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and 
 the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given, 
 unless better ones can be substituted ; and in no case should he 
 be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore." 
 
 The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in 
 /statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all 
 of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand. 
 
 It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon 
 "Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which 
 may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It 
 will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening 
 exercise.

 ANALYSIS. Since Eli paid 9 shillings for a pair of 
 skates, and 6 shillings for a cap, he paid for both, the 
 sum of 9 shillings -and 6 shillings. The sum of 9 shil- 
 lings and 6 shillings is 15 shillings. Therefore, he paid 
 J 5 shillings for both.

 6. Addition is the process of uniting several numbers 
 of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result 
 is called the Sam or Amount. The sign of addition is 
 written thus, +, and is called plus. When placed between 
 two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be 
 added together. Thus, 5 + 3 + 2 signifies that 5 and 3 
 and 2 are to be added together, and is read five, plus three, 
 plus two. 
 
 The sign of equality is written thus, :=. When placed 
 between two numbers or quantities, it signifies that the 
 latter is equal to the former.

 1 G. Multiplication is the process of finding a number which shall 
 contain one of two given nu:nbers as many times as there are units in 
 the other j the result is called the Product. 
 
 
 The sign of multiplication is written thus, X, and, placed 
 between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to 
 be multiplied together. 5 X 4 = 20, shows that 5 multi- 
 plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called 
 times. 5 X 4 is read 5 times 4.

 * When it is necessary to express a quantity less than a unit, we may 
 regard the unit as divided iiito some number of equal parts, and use 
 cue of these parts as a new unit of less value thau the unit divided. 
 Thus, if a yard be divided into two equal parts, each of the parts is 
 called one half; when into three equal parts, each of tue parts is called 
 one third wuen into four equal parts, each of the j>arts is called one 
 fourth ; when into Jive equal parts, each of the parts is called one-fifth ; 
 two of the parts, two fifths, &c. ; when into six equal parts, each of the 
 parts is called one sixth ; two of the parts, two sixths, three of the parts, 
 three sixths } &c.

 A Compound Number contains two or more names or 
 denominations ; thus, 5 dollars 25 cents, 16 bushels 3 pecks, 
 3 days 10 hours, are compound numbers. 
 
 Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one 
 denomination to another, without altering their value ; thus, 
 changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to

 in 8 halves there are as many whole things as 2, the num- 
 ber of halves in \, is contained times in 8, which is 4 
 times. Therefore, in 8 haloes there, are 4 whole things.

 HEM ARKS. 1. If the numerator be multiplied by any number, the 
 value of the fraction will be multiplied as many times as there are units 
 in the multiplier. 
 
 2. If the numerator be divided by any number, the value of the fraction 
 will be divided as many times as there are units in the divisor.

 therefore be taken for a common denominator. Since in 1 
 there are \%, in % of 1 there must be of -ff , or -fa, and in 
 % of I there must be f of |f , or ^. Therefore and 
 are equal to -fa and -f^.

 4. If the denominator be divided by any number, the value of the frac- 
 tion will be multiplied as many times as there are units in the divisor. 
 
 5. If both numerator and denominator be multiplied by the same 
 number, the value of the fraction will not be changed. 
 
 6. If both numerator and denominator be divided by the same number 
 the value of the fraction will not be changed.

 PERCENTAGE. 
 
 THE term?, percentage and per cent., signify by the hun- 
 dred, or hundredth*, that is, a certain number of parts of each 
 one hundred parts, of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5 
 per cent, is meant f) cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every 
 $100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c. Therefore, 5 
 per cent, equals 5 hundredth?, ( T ff,) or -2\s- 8 per cent., 8 
 liundredths, ( T o?) r & of the given number or quantity. 
 
 1. A man, having $40, lost 3 per cent, of it ; how 
 many dollars did he lose ?

 them at play ; what part of the whole had he left, 
 and how many did he lose ? 
 
 6. What per cent, of a barrel of flour is -f of it ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the whole of any number or thing is 
 equal to 100 per cent., f of one barrel of flour is equal to

 niay retain 68 bushels? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the thresher received T \j 2 jy, or -/$ of all 
 he threshed, the farmer received the difference between -{%$, 
 or J| and 2 \, which is f f . Then 66 bushels is f of the 
 whole number of bushels threshed ; since 66 bushels is , 
 2*5 * 5 sV f 66, or 3 bushels, and f | is 25 times 3 bushels, 
 or 75 bushels. Therefore, fyc.

 86. INTEREST is a sum paid for the use of borrowed 
 money, or on demands after they become due. 
 
 The PRINCIPAL is the money lent, or the sum for which 
 interest is paid. 
 
 The AMOUNT is the sum of the principal and interest. 
 
 The RATE PER CENT, is the sum paid for the use of 
 $100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for 
 the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent, per 
 annum. 
 
 The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain 
 number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest 
 of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths 
 Ortfo) or 2\r of the principal ; at 8 per cent, it is 8 hun- 
 dredths ( T |hj) or ITS f tne principal. 
 
 Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12 
 months a year, in computing interest. When no time is 
 named, one year is always understood. 
 
 The rate of interest is established by law; and taking 
 more than such rates is termed usury. 
 
 1. What is the yearly interest of 880, at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest is 5 per cent., or y^, equal 
 ~* 5TT f th & principal, the interest of $80 is ^V of $80, 
 or $4. Therefore, $c. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $1, or 100 cents, is 5 cents 
 for one year, the interest of $80 is 80 times 5 cents, or 400 
 cents, equal to $4.*

 cent. ? 
 
 87. 1. What is the interest of $150 for 3 years, 
 at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 1 year at 8 per cent, 
 is T f tf, equal to /$, of the principal, for 3 years it is 3 
 times /-%, or ^, of the principal. ^ of $150 is $6, and 
 2 \ of $150 is 6 times $6, or $36. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $150 for 1 year at 8 per 
 cent, is $12, (86,) for 3 years it is 3 times $12, or $36.

 15. Gave a note due at date, for $45.50, but did 
 not pay it until the end of 5 years ; what was the 
 interest due, at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 88. 1. At 8 per cent., what part of $1 equals 
 the use of it for 3 years 9 months ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since there are 12 months in 1 year, 9 
 months is T 9 5 , or of 1 year, and 3 years 9 months are equal 
 to 3f, or i-f- years. Since the interest of $1 for 1 year at 
 
 8 per cent, is yg^, equnl to /% of the principal, for 3 years 
 
 9 months, it is 3$ times, or Ig., of ^, equal to -fa of the 
 principal, or $ T 3 I7 . Therefore, $c. 
 
 2. At 6 per cent., what part of $1 equals the use 
 of it for 2 years 8 months ? 
 
 
 3. At 5 per cent., what part of any sum equals 
 the use of it for 2 years 6 months ? 
 
 4. At 7 per cent., what part of any sum equals

 part of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 12. At 8 per cent., for 3 years 3 months and 18 
 days, what part of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since 30 days make a month, 18 days are 
 .18.^ or of a month ; and since 12 months make a year, 
 I month is T V of a year ; of 1 month is -i- of r ^, 
 or ^ of I year, and 3f months, equal to -*-, is 18 times -^, 
 or ^ of a year. Hence the interest of $l/or 3 T 3 ^, or f.g 
 years, at 8 per cent., is T ^\ of it. (88 5 Ex. 1.) There- 
 fore, fyc. 
 
 13. What part of the principal equals the inter-

 days, what part of the principal will equal the in- 
 terest ? 
 
 89. 1. What is the interest of $40 for 3 years 
 4 months, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. 3 years 4 months equals 3, or *g- years; 
 and the interest of any sum for *g- years, at 6 per cent., 
 equals % of it. (88.) | of $40 is $8, the required in- 
 terest. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $1 for 1 year, at 6 per 
 cent., is 6 cents, for $40 it is 40 times 6 cents, or $2.40, and 
 for 3 years it is 3 J times $2.40, equal to $8.

 6 per cent. ? 
 
 11. What is the interest of $50 for 5 years 7 
 months and 15 days, at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The interest of any sum for 5 years 7 months 
 and 15 days, at 8 per cent., equals 2 9 o of **> (88 ? Ex. 12 ;) 
 of $50 is $2, and ^ of $50 is 9 times $2, equal to

 and 24 days, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 
 90. 1. What will be the amount of $60 for 2 
 years 6 months, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest is equal to $ of the prin- 
 cipal, (88 5 ) and the amount is equal to the principal and 
 interest, it follows that f g-, the principal, added to -$, the 
 interest, equals f , the amount. -^ of $60 is $3, and f $ 
 of $60 is 23 times $3, or $69, the amount. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 NOTE, "When more convenient, the interest may first be found, to 
 which add the principal, and the result will be the amount.

 91. 1. What principal in 3 years 9 months, at 
 8 per cent., will give $90 interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 9 months, at 8 
 per cent., is ^ of the principal, (88, j $90 must be -fa of 
 the required principal Since $90 is T V yV is $ of $90, or

 of his capital, and what was his entire loss or gain ? 
 
 
 92. 1. What principal will, in 3 years 4 months, 
 at 5 per cent, amount to $700. 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months, at 5 
 per cent, is ^ of the principal, (88,) the principal |, added 
 to the interest , equals the amount % ; hence $700 is % of 
 the principal Since $700 is , % is | of $700, or $100,

 93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent., will $60 
 
 gain $15 interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The gain, or interest, is , or % of the prin- 
 cipal, equal to 25 per cent, of the principal. (77 ? Ex. 7.) 
 Jf a given principal gain 5 per cent, in 1 year, it will re- 
 quire as many years to gain 25 per cent, as 5 per cent, is 
 contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, c. 
 
 Or thus : Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent., will gain 
 $3 interest, it will require as many years for $GO to gain 
 $15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5 
 times. 
 
 2. How long will it take $120 to gain $24 interest, 
 at 6 per cent. ?

 cent. ? 
 
 8. In what time will $49 gain $12.25, at 5 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 9. In what time will any given principal double 
 itself at 4 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since, to double itself, any sum of money 
 must gain 100 per cent., at 1 per cent., it will require 100 
 years, at 4 per cent., ^ of 100 years, or 25 years. There- 
 fore, fyc. 
 
 10. In what time will a given principal double it- 
 self at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 11. In what time will a given principal double it- 
 self at 7 per cent, ?

 self at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 13. In what time will a given principal double it- 
 self at 10 per cent. ? 
 
 14. -In what time will $500 double itself, at 12J 
 per cent. ? 
 
 15. In what time will $175 double itself at 20 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 16. In what time will a given principal treble it- 
 self at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per 
 cent, in 200 years ; at 5 per cent, in \ of 200 years, or 40 
 years. 
 
 17.* In what time will $100 treble itself at 6 per 
 cent. ? at 7 per cent. ? at 8 per cent. ? at 10 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re- 
 ceived $18 interest ; what was the rate per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is 
 |, or -/-$ of the principal, for 1 year it is J- of -$, or T {fo 
 of the principal, equal to G per cent. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or, thus : At 1 per cent., the interest of $1 for 4 years is 
 4 cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300 
 cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent, of $75 
 for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent, as $3 is 
 contained times in $18, which is 6 times, equal to 6 per 
 cent. 
 
 2. At what per cent, will $200 gain $49 interest 
 in 3J years ? 
 
 3. At what per cent, will $60 gain $25 interest in

 in 5 years ? 
 
 9. At what per cent, will $800 gain $75 interest 
 in 1 year and 3 months ? 
 
 10. At what per cent, will $180 gain $45 interest 
 in 8 years and 9 months ? 
 
 11. At what per cent, will $1250 gain $312.50 
 interest in 2 years 6 months ? 
 
 12. At what per cent, will $2500 gain $200 in- 
 terest in 1 year and 4 months ? 
 
 13. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 5 years ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since a given principal must gain 100 per 
 cent, to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will 
 require ^ of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 14. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 10 years ? 
 
 15. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 12 years 6 months ? 
 
 16. At what per cent, will $200 double itself in 4 
 years ? 
 
 17. At what per cent, will $100 double itself in 8 
 years ?

 95. The present worth of a note payable at a future 
 time is such a sum as, put at interest at the given rate per 
 cent, until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the 
 note. 
 
 Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money 
 before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the 
 present worth from the given sum or face of the note. 
 
 1. What is the present worth of $180 payable in 
 3 years 4 months at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at 
 6 per cent, is of the principal, (88 5 ) the amount, $180, 
 is equal to the principal, -|, added to the interest, -J, equal to 
 f of the principal. Since $180 is f of the principal, ^ oj 
 $180, or $30, is i, and $30 is -i of 5 times $30, or $150. 
 Therefore, fyc. 
 
 NOTE. The discount is the difference between $180 and $150, which 
 is $30.

 12. 26 melons were stolen, of the party getting 
 4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but 
 2 apiece ; how many were there in the party ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would 
 have been 28 melons ; then 4 times of a number, plus 3 
 times of the same number, or J, icould equal 28. Since 
 28 is of a number, $ of 28, or 4, is , and 4 i s of 2 
 times 4, or 8. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 13. 4 times |- of a number, plus 3J times the 
 same number, is equal to 28 plus 5 ; what is the 
 number ? 
 
 14. Henry said that 4 years more than J of his

 many baskets did he sell ? 
 
 17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times | 
 of it increased by 6 times *- of it ; how old is he ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. 5 times Henry's age equals f, 4 times of 
 it, plus 6 times ^ of it, equals - 1 /-, and if- less * equals 
 of it, which, according to the conditions of the question, is 
 3 ; and 3 is ^ of 3 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 18. 6 times a number is 4 less than 7 times | of 
 it, plus 5 times ^ of the same number ; what is the 
 number ? 
 
 19. Bridget, wishing to get a certain number of 
 pounds of meat, found, if she took beef at 5 cents,

 she took | of the quantity in beef, the rest in pork, 
 and paid for it ; how many pounds did she get ? 
 
 20. Pour times a number is 6 greater than 5 times 
 |- of the same number ; what is the number ? 
 
 21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep, 
 found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left ; 
 if he paid $5 a head, he had not enough to pay for* 
 them ; if he took |- the number at each price, he 
 could just pay for them ; how many sheep would 
 his money buy ? 
 
 22. Twice f of a number equals the number plus 
 8 : what is the number ? 
 
 
 1. The sum of two numbers is 27 ; their 
 difference 5 ; what are tiie numbers ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since 27 is the sum of two numbers whose 
 difference is 5, 27 less o, or 22, would be twice the less num- 
 ber ; of 22 is 11, //<? /ess number, which increased by 5 
 equals 16, or Me greater number. Therefore, fyc.

 for each ? 
 
 19. Wilber paid 20 shillings for a pair of skates 
 and a knife ; twice the difference between the cost of 
 the two, plus J the cost of the knife, equals the cost 
 of the skates ; what did he pay for each ? 
 
 20. A horse and harness cost $34 ; | of the cost 
 of the horse is $1 more than the cost of the harness ; 
 what was the cost of each ? 
 
 
 1O3. 1. A grocer paid 812.60 for 30 bushels of 
 potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and 
 20 cents a bushel for poor ones ; how many bushels 
 were good ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. If all had been good, he would have paid 
 $15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones 
 made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as -many 
 bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel) 
 is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on a//,) which is 
 8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones ; the difference be- 
 tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the 
 good ones. Therefore, fyc.

 that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and 
 
 
 pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received 
 at settlement $38 ; how many days was he idle ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. As many days as $3, (the difference made 
 by 1 idle day,} is contained times in $12, (the difference 
 made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times, llierefore he 
 was idle 4 days. 
 
 9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, re-

 1O4. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so 
 that f of the longer piece was equal to the shorter ; 
 what was the length of each piece ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The longer piece is divided into 5 equal 
 parts, 2 of which equal the shorter ; the sum of the 2 
 pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals | of 28 feet, 
 or 4 feet ; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which are 8 feet, 
 the shorter piece ; 5 parts equal o times 4 feet, which are 20 
 feet, the longer piece. Therefore, fyc.

 one shall equal the other. 
 
 
 11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples ; of 
 Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has; 
 how many has each ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Harlan has 6 more than as many as Ho- 
 mer, which makes the sum 48, 6 greater than if he had but 
 % as many ; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3 
 parts plus 6 apples are equal to Harlan' s ; then 4 parts 
 plus 3 parts, plus G apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42, 
 and y of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equal 
 24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num-

 21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied, 
 " The time past noon is equal to | of the time to 
 midnight." What was the hour ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The time to midniyht is divided into 5 equal 
 parts, one of which equals the time past noon ; then 5 parts 
 pins 1 part equals 6 parts \and- 12 Itours, the time from 
 noon to midnight, must be ^ of the time it lacked of being 
 midnight ; since 12 is f , -, which is o/f, will be of 12 
 hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock, 
 P.M. 
 
 22. What was the time, provided f- of the time 
 past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.? 
 
 23. | of the time from this instant to 5 o'clock, 
 P. M., equals f of the time past midnight; what is

 yards ; how many yards in each piece ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. If equal f -f- 4, ^ wz7/ e^waZ o/ 1 -j- 4, 
 wAicA is -i + 2, Jfo's zs of 3 times - + 2, or f -|- 6 ; 
 tf^ew we Aaz?e 1 piece equal to f ^e other plus 6 yards, or 1 
 pzece divided into 5 parts, and 3 of these parts plus 6 yards 
 equal the other piece ; hence 5 parts plus 3 j0ar& plus 6 yards 
 equal 38 yards, or 8 /?ars ano? 6 yards, equal 38 yards ; 38 
 yards minus 6 yards equal 32 yards, or 8 parts, fyc. 
 
 2. A lad inquiring his mother's age, his father

 was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first 
 plus I of the third, and the third was as long as the 
 other two ; what was the length of the rope* ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the third piece is as long as the other 
 two, it must be ^ of the rope ; the second piece, being as 
 long, is ^ ; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds J, with 
 the 5 feet of the first piece, make 10 feet, which must be the 
 other fourth ; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, fyc.

 the whole, lacking 2 bushels, the second digs 5 bush- 
 els, and the third digs as many as the other two ; 
 how many bushels did all dig ? 
 
 11. From Batavia to Avon is 24 miles ; this dis- 
 tance, plus the distance from Bath to Corning, and 
 12 miles more, equals the distance from Avon to 
 Bath ; from Bath to Corning is \- of the whole dis- 
 tance ; how far from Batavia to Corning ? 
 
 12. A farmer took money for stock, as follows : 
 $18 for swine, $6 more than of the whole for sheep, 
 and for cattle $7 less than f as much as for sheep 
 and swine ; how many dollars did he receive ? 
 
 13. A third and * a third of 12 is f of twice what 
 number ? 
 
 14. Stephen spent ^ of his money, and afterward 
 earned as much as he had spent, when he had $16.50 
 less than at first ; how much had he at first ? 
 
 15. If | of a ton of hay cost f of an eagle, how 
 many dollars will of a ton cost ? 
 
 16. A is 6 years more than -|- as old as B, C is | 
 as old as A, and B's age is equal to the sum of A's 
 and CV; what is the age of each ? 
 
 17. A owns 12 more than f as many acres as 
 B, C owns as many as A, and B owns 24 acres 
 
 than A and C ; how many acres has each. 
 
 
 1O6. 1. Malcom is 8 years old, and Martin 25 ; 
 in how many years will Malcom be -| as old as 
 Martin ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of age; 
 in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old, 
 in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 17 
 years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old. 
 Therefore, fyc. 
 
 2. A father is 22 years older than his son, and the 
 son's age is f of the father's ; how many years since 
 the son's age was J the father's ? 
 
 3. Helen is 9 years old, her sister is 22 ; in now 
 many years will Helen be - as old as her sister ? 
 
 4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who 
 had 45 ; Henry won as many as he had to commence 
 with ; when they quit, each had the same number ; 
 how many had both ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since Henry won as many as he had, he left 
 off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles, 
 now having the same number, must have had 3 times as 
 many as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3 
 times -J of 45, or 15, and 45 -\- 15 is 60. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 5. A farmer, having 60 sheep in one field, took as 
 many from them as he had in another field, and put 
 them with the others, when the flocks were equal ; 
 how many sheep had he ?

 as many bushels as were in another bin were taken 
 and put in the other bin, when both contained the 
 same quantity ; how many bushels in both bins ? 
 
 7. Uncle Simon's age, increased by the difference 
 between -| and % of his age, is 6 more than ^ times 
 his age ; how old is he ? 
 
 8. Henry earned 20 dollars in the spring ; in the 
 fall he earned as much as in the spring and as 
 
 
 much as in the summer, and in the summer as much 
 as in the spring and fall ; how much did he earn in 
 all? 
 
 9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and | as 
 many as B, and B has as many as A and C ; how 
 many sheep have they all ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since B has as many as A and C he muit 
 have of the ivltole ; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -f~ % f i 
 phis , equals % -\- 20, or the whole number of sheep ; hence 
 20 equals the number, and 20 is \ of 6 times 20, or 120 
 sheep. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 10. A, owning 74 acres of land, sold B | as much 
 as B owned ; then B's farm was f as large as A's ; 
 how many acres in each farm ? 
 
 11. Mary has 10 more chickens than turkeys, yet 
 | of the turkeys equal \ the chickens ; how many 
 chickens has she ? 
 
 12. Hainan's coat cost $15 less than his whole 
 suit ; ^ of the price of the suit equaled | of the price 
 of the coat ; what did the suit cost ? 
 
 13. Daniel caught 14 pigeons more than his 
 brother, and 2f times his brother's equaled | of his ; 
 how many did each catch ? 
 
 14. One number is 31 times another ; if 15 be 
 added to each, one is just ^ of the other; what are 
 the numbers ?

 and a buggy is $40 ; | of the cost of the buggy equal 
 -^5 of the cost of the horse ; what is the value of 
 each ? 
 
 16. Alice is l as old as her mother ; 5 years since 
 she was but ^ as old ; in how many years will she be 
 J as old ? 
 
 IT. Hobart, having 20 marbles more than Dwight, 
 plays with him ; Dwight w r ins |- as many as he had 
 
 
 at first, when Hobart lias |- as many left as he com- 
 menced with ; how many had each at first ? 
 
 18. The difference between two numbers is 16 ; 
 if 4 be taken from the larger and added to the less, 
 2 1 times the larger will equal 3J times the smaller; 
 what are the numbers ? 
 
 19. Jason bought a watch, and had 820 remain- 
 ing ; he then gave 2 times the cost of the watch for 
 a rifle, and had -^ of his money left ; what did the 
 rifle cost ? 
 
 20. Find the ages of A, B, and C, by knowing 
 that C's age at A's birth was 5J times B's, and now 
 is equal to the sum of A's and B's ; also that if A 
 were now 3 years younger, or B 4 years older, A's 
 age would be equal to | of B's. 
 
 1O7. 1. Two boys are running in the same 
 direction ; one is 27 rods in advance of the other in 
 pursuit, who gains upon the foremost 3 rods in a 
 minute ; in how many minutes will he be overtaken ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. In as many minutes as 3, the number of rods 
 gained in one minute, is contained times in 27, the number 
 of rods to be gained. 
 
 2. A, after traveling 2 hours, at the rate of 5 
 miles an hour, was followed by B, at the rate of 7 
 miles an hour ; in how many hours would B over- 
 take A ? 
 
 3. A dog in pursuit of a hare which has 28 rods 
 the start, runs 9 rods while the hare runs 7 ; how far 
 will the dog run to catch the hare ? 
 
 4. Henry saves $5 while John saves $ 7 ; how 
 much will each have when the difference between 
 what each has saved is $30 ? 
 
 5. A and B started from the same point to run a 
 race ; A ran 84 rods and gave out, when ^ of the 
 
 
 distance B had run equaled the distance he was 
 ahead of A ; how far did B run ? 
 
 G. Three men bought a horse ; A paid $25, which 
 was ^ of what B and C paid ; B paid | as much a& 
 A and C ; what did B and C pay ? 
 
 7. The hour and minute hands of a watch aro 
 together at 12 o'clock ; when will they next be to- 
 gether ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand 
 11 times in 12 hours, if both are at 12, the minute hand will 
 pass the hour hand the jirst time in -J f of 1 2 hours, or in 
 l^Y hours, equal to 5^ minutes past 1 o'clock. There- 
 fore, $c. 
 
 8. A gentleman, being asked the time, replied, 
 " It is between 3 and 4 o'clock, and the hands are 
 directly opposite." What was the time ? 
 
 9. A fox is 40 leaps ahead of a hound, and takes 
 7 leaps to the hound's 4 ; but 3 of the hound's leaps 
 equal 6 of the fox's ; how many leaps will the fox 
 take before being caught ? 
 
 10. A wolf ran 80 rods to catch a sheep ; f of the 
 distance the sheep ran was equal to the distance be- 
 tween them when the chase commenced ; what was 
 the distance ?

 ing $3 apiece for calves and $2 for sheep ; he sold \ 
 of his calves and f of his sheep for $23, and in so 
 doing lost 8 per cent, on their cost ; how many of 
 each did he purchase ? 
 
APPENDIX. 
 
 THE author desires to call the attention of teachers to the numbered 
 Tariety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec. 
 tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many 
 otheis of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring- 
 ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap- 
 plied to ail the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited 
 according to the time and convenience of the teacher. 
 
 It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these 
 * changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening 
 effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities 
 they afford for thorough mental discipline ; and while, at first, to some 
 they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become 
 easy and comprehensible. 
 
 To aid beginners, the blackboard may be used to advantage ; and to 
 illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section 
 71 5 page 171-3: 
 
 4- of 35 is I of how many thirds of 18 ? 
 which may be written on the board thus : 
 
 f x 35 = f X 7 X 18? 
 
 Call upon seme pupil to read the question according to thejfost form, 
 and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given ; and 
 the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of th 
 question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus : 
 
 which is read 
 
 4. of 35 is f of f of what number ? 
 
 Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been 
 erased, and replaced by solution. 
 
 AVhen the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use of the 
 blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring 
 the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read. 
 
 Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil, 
 but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been 
 previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid 
 monotonous repetition. 
 
 Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en- 
 couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or 
 solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly 
 and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence 
 operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu- 
 sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises 
 the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re- 
 sume where the last one left off; and so on. 
 
 A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot 
 conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that 
 may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this 
 exercise ; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself 
 to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.

 9. f of 9 times f of 42 is 4 times what part of 36 ? 
 
 ^ of 9 times i of 42 is 4 times such part of 36 as 36 is 
 contained times in | of 4 times ^ of 9 times 2 times 4 of 
 42 ; 4 of 42 is 6, 2 times 6 is 12, and 9 times 12 is 108 ; 
 l of 108 is 12, and 4 times 12 is 48 ; \ of 48 is 12, and 
 36 is contained in 12, || or ^ times. Therefore ^ of 9

 PREFACE. 
 
 
 THE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the 
 study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi- 
 ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the 
 thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture, 
 can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary- study for 
 young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as 
 a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it 
 is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and 
 ready students of mathematics are those who have been most 
 thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic. 
 
 This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes, 
 and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the 
 primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written 
 arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer- 
 cised in this branch of study. 
 
 Only a few of the many points of difference between this and 
 other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior 
 to them, will be referred to. 
 
 It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive In its char- 
 acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys- 
 tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical 
 science. The development of principles, and their applications, 
 are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of 
 appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with 
 those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com- 
 plex and difficult. 
 
 At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap- 
 ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles, 
 and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every 
 principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough 
 review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what 
 he has been over. 
 
 One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most 
 original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and 
 uniform system of ANALYSIS it contains, the result of long expe- 
 rience in the school-room. 
 
 Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per- 
 centage, and Interest ; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to 
 obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the 
 operations in them.

 The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable 
 and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge- 
 bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they 
 may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every 
 principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions 
 of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult 
 fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy. 
 
 In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belie'f, that 
 in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long 
 sought in this department of science, the means of mental dis- 
 cipline and development such as has been furnished by uo 
 similar treatise. 
 
 THE AUTHOR. 
 
 SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
 
 Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be 
 classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the 
 class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine 
 their lesson before being called upon to recite. 
 
 The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly 
 prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons 
 in the latter part of the work. 
 
 Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly, 
 the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand 
 erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will 
 secure close attention. 
 
 Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and 
 the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given, 
 unless better ones can be substituted ; and in no case should he 
 be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore." 
 
 The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in 
 /statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all 
 of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand. 
 
 It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon 
 "Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which 
 may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It 
 will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening 
 exercise.

 of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result 
 is called the Sam or Amount. The sign of addition is 
 written thus, +, and is called plus. When placed between 
 two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be 
 added together. Thus, 5 + 3 + 2 signifies that 5 and 3 
 and 2 are to be added together, and is read five, plus three, 
 plus two. 
 
 The sign of equality is written thus, :=. When placed 
 between two numbers or quantities, it signifies that the 
 latter is equal to the former.

 1 G. Multiplication is the process of finding a number which shall 
 contain one of two given nu:nbers as many times as there are units in 
 the other j the result is called the Product. 
 
 
 The sign of multiplication is written thus, X, and, placed 
 between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to 
 be multiplied together. 5 X 4 = 20, shows that 5 multi- 
 plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called 
 times. 5 X 4 is read 5 times 4.

 * When it is necessary to express a quantity less than a unit, we may 
 regard the unit as divided iiito some number of equal parts, and use 
 cue of these parts as a new unit of less value thau the unit divided. 
 Thus, if a yard be divided into two equal parts, each of the parts is 
 called one half; when into three equal parts, each of tue parts is called 
 one third wuen into four equal parts, each of the j>arts is called one 
 fourth ; when into Jive equal parts, each of the parts is called one-fifth ; 
 two of the parts, two fifths, &c. ; when into six equal parts, each of the 
 parts is called one sixth ; two of the parts, two sixths, three of the parts, 
 three sixths } &c.

 denominations ; thus, 5 dollars 25 cents, 16 bushels 3 pecks, 
 3 days 10 hours, are compound numbers. 
 
 Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one 
 denomination to another, without altering their value ; thus, 
 changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to

 HEM ARKS. 1. If the numerator be multiplied by any number, the 
 value of the fraction will be multiplied as many times as there are units 
 in the multiplier. 
 
 2. If the numerator be divided by any number, the value of the fraction 
 will be divided as many times as there are units in the divisor. 
 
 3. .If the denominator be multiplied by any number, the value of the 
 fraction will be divided as many times* as there are units in the multi- 
 plier.

 denominator. 
 
 ANALYSIS. 12 is exactly divisible by 4 and 3, and may 
 therefore be taken for a common denominator. Since in 1 
 there are \%, in % of 1 there must be of -ff , or -fa, and in 
 % of I there must be f of |f , or ^. Therefore and 
 are equal to -fa and -f^.

 nator. 
 
 13. Reduce ^, ^ and ^ to a common denomi- 
 nator. 
 
 14. Reduce 1^, 2^ and f to a common denomi- 
 nator. 
 
 4. If the denominator be divided by any number, the value of the frac- 
 tion will be multiplied as many times as there are units in the divisor. 
 
 5. If both numerator and denominator be multiplied by the same 
 number, the value of the fraction will not be changed. 
 
 6. If both numerator and denominator be divided by the same number 
 the value of the fraction will not be changed.

 he gained 30 per cent., and on the other he lost 
 80 per cent.; did he. gain or lose on both, and how 
 much ? 
 
 20. A music dealer sold a piano-forte for $230,

 86. INTEREST is a sum paid for the use of borrowed 
 money, or on demands after they become due. 
 
 The PRINCIPAL is the money lent, or the sum for which 
 interest is paid. 
 
 The AMOUNT is the sum of the principal and interest. 
 
 The RATE PER CENT, is the sum paid for the use of 
 $100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for 
 the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent, per 
 annum. 
 
 The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain 
 number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest 
 of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths 
 Ortfo) or 2\r of the principal ; at 8 per cent, it is 8 hun- 
 dredths ( T |hj) or ITS f tne principal. 
 
 Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12 
 months a year, in computing interest. When no time is 
 named, one year is always understood. 
 
 The rate of interest is established by law; and taking 
 more than such rates is termed usury. 
 
 1. What is the yearly interest of 880, at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest is 5 per cent., or y^, equal 
 ~* 5TT f th & principal, the interest of $80 is ^V of $80, 
 or $4. Therefore, $c. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $1, or 100 cents, is 5 cents 
 for one year, the interest of $80 is 80 times 5 cents, or 400 
 cents, equal to $4.*

 cent. ? 
 
 87. 1. What is the interest of $150 for 3 years, 
 at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 1 year at 8 per cent, 
 is T f tf, equal to /$, of the principal, for 3 years it is 3 
 times /-%, or ^, of the principal. ^ of $150 is $6, and 
 2 \ of $150 is 6 times $6, or $36. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $150 for 1 year at 8 per 
 cent, is $12, (86,) for 3 years it is 3 times $12, or $36.

 per cent ; what will be the interest ? 
 
 15. Gave a note due at date, for $45.50, but did 
 not pay it until the end of 5 years ; what was the 
 interest due, at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 88. 1. At 8 per cent., what part of $1 equals 
 the use of it for 3 years 9 months ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since there are 12 months in 1 year, 9 
 months is T 9 5 , or of 1 year, and 3 years 9 months are equal 
 to 3f, or i-f- years. Since the interest of $1 for 1 year at 
 
 8 per cent, is yg^, equnl to /% of the principal, for 3 years 
 
 9 months, it is 3$ times, or Ig., of ^, equal to -fa of the 
 principal, or $ T 3 I7 . Therefore, $c.

 of it for 2 years 8 months ? 
 
 
 3. At 5 per cent., what part of any sum equals 
 the use of it for 2 years 6 months ? 
 
 4. At 7 per cent., what part of any sum equals

 part of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 10. At 6 per cent., for 2 years 1 month, what part 
 of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 11. At 10 per cent., for 4 years 10 months, what 
 part of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 12. At 8 per cent., for 3 years 3 months and 18 
 days, what part of the principal equals the interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since 30 days make a month, 18 days are 
 .18.^ or of a month ; and since 12 months make a year, 
 I month is T V of a year ; of 1 month is -i- of r ^, 
 or ^ of I year, and 3f months, equal to -*-, is 18 times -^, 
 or ^ of a year. Hence the interest of $l/or 3 T 3 ^, or f.g 
 years, at 8 per cent., is T ^\ of it. (88 5 Ex. 1.) There- 
 fore, fyc.

 part of the principal will equal the interest ? 
 
 21. At 4 per cent., for 8 years 6 months and 15 
 days, what part of the principal will equal the in- 
 terest ? 
 
 89. 1. What is the interest of $40 for 3 years 
 4 months, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. 3 years 4 months equals 3, or *g- years; 
 and the interest of any sum for *g- years, at 6 per cent., 
 equals % of it. (88.) | of $40 is $8, the required in- 
 terest. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or thus : Since the interest of $1 for 1 year, at 6 per 
 cent., is 6 cents, for $40 it is 40 times 6 cents, or $2.40, and 
 for 3 years it is 3 J times $2.40, equal to $8.

 6 per cent. ? 
 
 11. What is the interest of $50 for 5 years 7 
 months and 15 days, at 8 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The interest of any sum for 5 years 7 months 
 and 15 days, at 8 per cent., equals 2 9 o of **> (88 ? Ex. 12 ;) 
 of $50 is $2, and ^ of $50 is 9 times $2, equal to

 and 24 days, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 
 90. 1. What will be the amount of $60 for 2 
 years 6 months, at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest is equal to $ of the prin- 
 cipal, (88 5 ) and the amount is equal to the principal and 
 interest, it follows that f g-, the principal, added to -$, the 
 interest, equals f , the amount. -^ of $60 is $3, and f $ 
 of $60 is 23 times $3, or $69, the amount. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 NOTE, "When more convenient, the interest may first be found, to

 91. 1. What principal in 3 years 9 months, at 
 8 per cent., will give $90 interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 9 months, at 8 
 per cent., is ^ of the principal, (88, j $90 must be -fa of 
 the required principal Since $90 is T V yV is $ of $90, or

 remaining -f he invested in bank stock, which at the 
 end of 1 year had gained $1200, which was 12 per 
 cent, of the investment ; what was the whole amount 
 of his capital, and what was his entire loss or gain ? 
 
 
 92. 1. What principal will, in 3 years 4 months, 
 at 5 per cent, amount to $700. 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months, at 5 
 per cent, is ^ of the principal, (88,) the principal |, added 
 to the interest , equals the amount % ; hence $700 is % of 
 the principal Since $700 is , % is | of $700, or $100, 
 and $100 w o/ 6 times $100, or $600. * Therefore, $c.

 much was he worth when he commenced trade ? 
 
 11. A's money is to B's as 2 to 3 ; if of A's 
 money be put at interest for 3 years 9 months, at 
 10 per cent., it will amount to $550 ; how much 
 money has each ? 
 
 
 93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent., will $60 
 
 gain $15 interest ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The gain, or interest, is , or % of the prin- 
 cipal, equal to 25 per cent, of the principal. (77 ? Ex. 7.) 
 Jf a given principal gain 5 per cent, in 1 year, it will re- 
 quire as many years to gain 25 per cent, as 5 per cent, is 
 contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, c. 
 
 Or thus : Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent., will gain 
 $3 interest, it will require as many years for $GO to gain 
 $15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5 
 times. 
 
 2. How long will it take $120 to gain $24 interest, 
 at 6 per cent. ?

 cent. ? 
 
 8. In what time will $49 gain $12.25, at 5 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 9. In what time will any given principal double 
 itself at 4 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since, to double itself, any sum of money 
 must gain 100 per cent., at 1 per cent., it will require 100 
 years, at 4 per cent., ^ of 100 years, or 25 years. There- 
 fore, fyc.

 15. In what time will $175 double itself at 20 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 16. In what time will a given principal treble it- 
 self at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per 
 cent, in 200 years ; at 5 per cent, in \ of 200 years, or 40 
 years. 
 
 17.* In what time will $100 treble itself at 6 per 
 cent. ? at 7 per cent. ? at 8 per cent. ? at 10 per 
 cent. ? 
 
 94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re- 
 ceived $18 interest ; what was the rate per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is 
 |, or -/-$ of the principal, for 1 year it is J- of -$, or T {fo 
 of the principal, equal to G per cent. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 Or, thus : At 1 per cent., the interest of $1 for 4 years is 
 4 cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300 
 cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent, of $75 
 for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent, as $3 is 
 contained times in $18, which is 6 times, equal to 6 per 
 cent. 
 
 2. At what per cent, will $200 gain $49 interest 
 in 3J years ? 
 
 3. At what per cent, will $60 gain $25 interest in

 in 1 year and 3 months ? 
 
 10. At what per cent, will $180 gain $45 interest 
 in 8 years and 9 months ? 
 
 11. At what per cent, will $1250 gain $312.50 
 interest in 2 years 6 months ? 
 
 12. At what per cent, will $2500 gain $200 in- 
 terest in 1 year and 4 months ? 
 
 13. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 5 years ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since a given principal must gain 100 per 
 cent, to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will 
 require ^ of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 14. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 10 years ? 
 
 15. At what per cent, will a given principal double 
 itself in 12 years 6 months ? 
 
 16. At what per cent, will $200 double itself in 4 
 years ? 
 
 17. At what per cent, will $100 double itself in 8 
 years ?

 95. The present worth of a note payable at a future 
 time is such a sum as, put at interest at the given rate per 
 cent, until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the 
 note. 
 
 Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money 
 before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the 
 present worth from the given sum or face of the note. 
 
 1. What is the present worth of $180 payable in 
 3 years 4 months at 6 per cent. ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at 
 6 per cent, is of the principal, (88 5 ) the amount, $180, 
 is equal to the principal, -|, added to the interest, -J, equal to 
 f of the principal. Since $180 is f of the principal, ^ oj 
 $180, or $30, is i, and $30 is -i of 5 times $30, or $150. 
 Therefore, fyc.

 9. A laborer in one week dug 5 rods more than 
 | the length of a ditch, and the next week he dug the

 11 parts ; T ] T of $55 is $5, or\ part; 6 times $5 are $30, 
 or As share ; and 5 times $5 are $25, or B's share. Ttiere-

 have been 28 melons ; then 4 times of a number, plus 3 
 times of the same number, or J, icould equal 28. Since 
 28 is of a number, $ of 28, or 4, is , and 4 i s of 2 
 times 4, or 8. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 13. 4 times |- of a number, plus 3J times the 
 same number, is equal to 28 plus 5 ; what is the 
 number ? 
 
 14. Henry said that 4 years more than J of his 
 age, increased by 5 times ^ of it, and that sum by 4 
 times ^ of his age less 4, would make the sum 50 
 years ; how old was he ? 
 
 
 15. A drover paid $5 a head for J of his flock, $4 
 a head for as many more, $3 a head for | of the

 many baskets did he sell ? 
 
 17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times | 
 of it increased by 6 times *- of it ; how old is he ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. 5 times Henry's age equals f, 4 times of 
 it, plus 6 times ^ of it, equals - 1 /-, and if- less * equals 
 of it, which, according to the conditions of the question, is 
 3 ; and 3 is ^ of 3 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 18. 6 times a number is 4 less than 7 times | of 
 it, plus 5 times ^ of the same number ; what is the 
 number ? 
 
 19. Bridget, wishing to get a certain number of 
 pounds of meat, found, if she took beef at 5 cents,

 she took | of the quantity in beef, the rest in pork, 
 and paid for it ; how many pounds did she get ? 
 
 20. Pour times a number is 6 greater than 5 times 
 |- of the same number ; what is the number ? 
 
 21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep, 
 found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left ; 
 if he paid $5 a head, he had not enough to pay for* 
 them ; if he took |- the number at each price, he 
 could just pay for them ; how many sheep would 
 his money buy ? 
 
 22. Twice f of a number equals the number plus 
 8 : what is the number ? 
 
 
 1. The sum of two numbers is 27 ; their 
 difference 5 ; what are tiie numbers ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since 27 is the sum of two numbers whose 
 difference is 5, 27 less o, or 22, would be twice the less num- 
 ber ; of 22 is 11, //<? /ess number, which increased by 5 
 equals 16, or Me greater number. Therefore, fyc.

 years ago, A's age was J of B's ; what are their ages 
 now? 
 
 
 12. A horse and cow cost $124 ; the horse cost 
 $4 more than 3 times the cost of the cow ; what was 
 the cost of each ? 
 
 13. A farmer paid $24 for a colt and cow ; the 
 cost of the colt, multiplied by ^ the cost of the cow, 
 equaled the cost of the cow ; what did he pay for 
 each ? 
 
 14. A lady purchased a dish and cover for 24 
 dimes ; | of the cost of the dish, increased by the 
 difference between the cost of the dish and cover, 
 equals the cost of the cover ; what was the cost of 
 each ? 
 
 15. A grocer purchased 25 pounds of butter of 
 two women ; | of the number of pounds he took of 
 one, increased by the difference between the amounts 
 purchased of both, equals the number of pounds he

 for each ? 
 
 19. Wilber paid 20 shillings for a pair of skates 
 and a knife ; twice the difference between the cost of 
 the two, plus J the cost of the knife, equals the cost 
 of the skates ; what did he pay for each ? 
 
 20. A horse and harness cost $34 ; | of the cost 
 of the horse is $1 more than the cost of the harness ; 
 what was the cost of each ? 
 
 
 1O3. 1. A grocer paid 812.60 for 30 bushels of 
 potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and 
 20 cents a bushel for poor ones ; how many bushels 
 were good ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. If all had been good, he would have paid 
 $15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones 
 made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as -many 
 bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel) 
 is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on a//,) which is 
 8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones ; the difference be- 
 tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the 
 good ones. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 2. A fanner bought 28 sheep for $76, paying $3 
 for old sheep, and $2 for yearlings ; how many old

 8. A man engaged to work 25 days, on condition 
 that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and 
 
 
 pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received 
 at settlement $38 ; how many days was he idle ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. As many days as $3, (the difference made 
 by 1 idle day,} is contained times in $12, (the difference 
 made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times, llierefore he 
 was idle 4 days. 
 
 9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, re- 
 ceiving $2.50 for every day's labor, and forfeiting $1

 many days was he idle ? 
 
 
 1O4. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so 
 that f of the longer piece was equal to the shorter ; 
 what was the length of each piece ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The longer piece is divided into 5 equal 
 parts, 2 of which equal the shorter ; the sum of the 2 
 pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals | of 28 feet, 
 or 4 feet ; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which are 8 feet, 
 the shorter piece ; 5 parts equal o times 4 feet, which are 20 
 feet, the longer piece. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 2. A tree 56 feet high was broken in a storm ; | of

 one shall equal the other. 
 
 
 11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples ; of 
 Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has; 
 how many has each ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Harlan has 6 more than as many as Ho- 
 mer, which makes the sum 48, 6 greater than if he had but 
 % as many ; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3 
 parts plus 6 apples are equal to Harlan' s ; then 4 parts 
 plus 3 parts, plus G apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42, 
 and y of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equal 
 24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num- 
 ber Homer has. Therefore, fyc.

 21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied, 
 " The time past noon is equal to | of the time to 
 midnight." What was the hour ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. The time to midniyht is divided into 5 equal 
 parts, one of which equals the time past noon ; then 5 parts 
 pins 1 part equals 6 parts \and- 12 Itours, the time from 
 noon to midnight, must be ^ of the time it lacked of being 
 midnight ; since 12 is f , -, which is o/f, will be of 12 
 hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock, 
 P.M. 
 
 22. What was the time, provided f- of the time 
 past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.? 
 
 23. | of the time from this instant to 5 o'clock, 
 P. M., equals f of the time past midnight; what is 
 the time of day ?

 yards ; how many yards in each piece ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. If equal f -f- 4, ^ wz7/ e^waZ o/ 1 -j- 4, 
 wAicA is -i + 2, Jfo's zs of 3 times - + 2, or f -|- 6 ; 
 tf^ew we Aaz?e 1 piece equal to f ^e other plus 6 yards, or 1 
 pzece divided into 5 parts, and 3 of these parts plus 6 yards 
 equal the other piece ; hence 5 parts plus 3 j0ar& plus 6 yards 
 equal 38 yards, or 8 /?ars ano? 6 yards, equal 38 yards ; 38 
 yards minus 6 yards equal 32 yards, or 8 parts, fyc. 
 
 2. A lad inquiring his mother's age, his father 
 replied, u f of my age is 9 years more than |- of

 was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first 
 plus I of the third, and the third was as long as the 
 other two ; what was the length of the rope* ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the third piece is as long as the other 
 two, it must be ^ of the rope ; the second piece, being as 
 long, is ^ ; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds J, with 
 the 5 feet of the first piece, make 10 feet, which must be the 
 other fourth ; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 
 8. The head of a fish is 7 inches long, the tail is 
 as long as the head and i of the body, and the body

 ANALYSIS. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of age; 
 in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old, 
 in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 17 
 years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old. 
 Therefore, fyc. 
 
 2. A father is 22 years older than his son, and the 
 son's age is f of the father's ; how many years since 
 the son's age was J the father's ? 
 
 3. Helen is 9 years old, her sister is 22 ; in now 
 many years will Helen be - as old as her sister ? 
 
 4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who 
 had 45 ; Henry won as many as he had to commence 
 with ; when they quit, each had the same number ; 
 how many had both ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since Henry won as many as he had, he left 
 off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles, 
 now having the same number, must have had 3 times as 
 many as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3 
 times -J of 45, or 15, and 45 -\- 15 is 60. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 5. A farmer, having 60 sheep in one field, took as 
 many from them as he had in another field, and put 
 them with the others, when the flocks were equal ; 
 how many sheep had he ?

 much as in the summer, and in the summer as much 
 as in the spring and fall ; how much did he earn in 
 all? 
 
 9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and | as 
 many as B, and B has as many as A and C ; how 
 many sheep have they all ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since B has as many as A and C he muit 
 have of the ivltole ; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -f~ % f i 
 phis , equals % -\- 20, or the whole number of sheep ; hence 
 20 equals the number, and 20 is \ of 6 times 20, or 120 
 sheep. Therefore, fyc. 
 
 10. A, owning 74 acres of land, sold B | as much 
 as B owned ; then B's farm was f as large as A's ;

 menced with ; how many had each at first ? 
 
 18. The difference between two numbers is 16 ; 
 if 4 be taken from the larger and added to the less, 
 2 1 times the larger will equal 3J times the smaller; 
 what are the numbers ? 
 
 19. Jason bought a watch, and had 820 remain- 
 ing ; he then gave 2 times the cost of the watch for 
 a rifle, and had -^ of his money left ; what did the

 ahead of A ; how far did B run ? 
 
 G. Three men bought a horse ; A paid $25, which 
 was ^ of what B and C paid ; B paid | as much a& 
 A and C ; what did B and C pay ? 
 
 7. The hour and minute hands of a watch aro 
 together at 12 o'clock ; when will they next be to- 
 gether ? 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand

 THE author desires to call the attention of teachers to the numbered 
 Tariety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec. 
 tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many 
 otheis of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring- 
 ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap- 
 plied to ail the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited 
 according to the time and convenience of the teacher. 
 
 It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these 
 * changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening 
 effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities 
 they afford for thorough mental discipline ; and while, at first, to some 
 they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become 
 easy and comprehensible. 
 
 To aid beginners, the blackboard may be used to advantage ; and to 
 illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section 
 71 5 page 171-3: 
 
 4- of 35 is I of how many thirds of 18 ? 
 which may be written on the board thus : 
 
 f x 35 = f X 7 X 18? 
 
 Call upon seme pupil to read the question according to thejfost form, 
 and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given ; and 
 the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of th 
 question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus : 
 
 which is read 
 
 4. of 35 is f of f of what number ? 
 
 Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been 
 erased, and replaced by solution. 
 
 AVhen the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use of the 
 blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring 
 the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read. 
 
 Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil, 
 but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been 
 previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid 
 monotonous repetition. 
 
 Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en- 
 couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or 
 solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly 
 and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence 
 operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu- 
 sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises 
 the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re- 
 sume where the last one left off; and so on. 
 
 A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot 
 conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that 
 may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this 
 exercise ; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself 
 to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.
