ACT THE FIRST.
SCENE I.
Robinson Crusoe's Farm. A steep Hill at the back.
The Mouth of the Cave, with the Sea and a part
of the Shore.
Friday appears above, on the look out.
Fri. There! I have put the cake, a bunch of raisins,
and the bottle of rum all ready for my massa!
[A dog barks.
Ha, ha! I do hear massa Crusoe's voice!
[ The dog runs on with a bird--Friday takes it
from him, and throws it over the enclosure—
Crusoe enters, bearing an umbrella, with a
parrot perched upon it.
Cru. Here I am once more, Friday!
Parrot. Friday, Friday!
Cru. Take this, Friday!—{offering him the gun,
which Friday seems afraid to touch, and recoils as
Crusoe advances to him).
Cru. What alarms you, Friday ?—Ob, you are
frightened at the thunder, as you call it: but yon need
not fear; it is made for the bad man, and not for you.
Besides, this was the instrument with which I saved
your life, when the Cannibals had doomed you to
suffer the most inhuman torments.
Fri. Ah, massa, me know you do me good.—But
me not afraid of you, though me shake atthe thunder.
A3
But you tell me not to fear; so me will take him gun
away for my massa. [Exit with gun, $c.
Cru. It was a fortunate circumstance for me when
I saved the life of poor Friday: he cheers my soli-
tude: and when to him I whisper the name of either
ray wife or child, with true simplicity of heart, he drops
a tear to sooth my bitterness.—Friday!
Fri. (From above) Do you call me, massa?
Cru. Yes; we must now to our labour: if we can
once complete this canoe, all will be well:—and see!
my dog attends me with my basket and hatchet.
Fri. Oh, massa! massa!
Cru. What's the matter?
Fri. Canoes are in sight!
Cru. How many 1
Fri. One, two, three, four!
Cru. Perhaps a vessel!—No; it cannot be; for he
counted several. [ Friday comes down.
You tremble, Friday?
Fri. I cannot help it, massa; for some of the bad
men are coming here to roast another man!
Cru, Ha! Cannibals!—perhaps you are deceived.
Fri. No, no! you look, massa, and you will see as
much as I do.
Cru. You are right.—Friday, secure the dog—con-
ceal yourself in the canoe—I will gain the heights, and
we shall have nought to fear. [Crusoe exits.
Pariboo, the Cannibal chief, enters, and is fol-
lowed by his troops, who bring in Iglon as their
prisoner.—Iglon implores his life.
Far. It is in vain!—you have been conquered, and
imist be sacrificed!
FH. It is my father!
Iglon. For mercy's sake, do not—do not, kill me!
Par. I will not hear him !—*come, prepare?
{ Pariboo rushes to dispatch Iglon— Crusoe fires—
Friday rushes from his hiding-pla&e-*-Iglon
fait* on his face frightened, and the Cannibals,
mith their chief, rush out.
Fri. Oh, massa, massa! your thunder has kitted ray-
father!
Cru. Your father!—kind heaven, I thank thee!—But
we have no time to lose:—bear your father to the cave;
I will watch the foe, and see that they all quit the island.
Iglon. This is a happy moment!
Fri. Yes ; thank to massa thunder.
Cru. Be cautious; it is a moment of real happiness:
let us, therefore, use it to the best advantage.—Away!
away! [Exeunt.
SCENE II.
Entrance to u Wood.
Enter Swivel and Nipcheese.
Swiv. Why, master steward, you don't crowd sail
at all—you seem quite becalmed.
Nip. So I am—I don't know which way to move:
I've never been right since this mutiny took place;
and I don't think I shall ever be worth anything, till I
am hanged like a dog!—I tell you what, Swivel, we
are in a nice condition: the boatswain has sent the
mate adrift, and all because he would not become as
great a rogue as the rest of us.
Swiv. And now's he's looking out for a birth in the
woods: but he is without gun or sword, and you need
not fear him.
Nip. But he has got arms, for all that; and a couple
of fists like 24 pounders at the end of them: and I
shouldn^t like to have a broadside from him just now.
Swiv. The gun we heard must have been fired from
this point.
Nip. Well, then, we'll steer to the other, if you
please: I think it always shows wisdom, whenwe en-
deavour to avoid danger.
*Swiv. But will you, to avoid danger, give up all
you have in the world?
Nip. Not I, indeed!—I never boast; I never say
any thing about courage: but when dangerappears!
[The savages yell without.
8
Oh, dear!—If you don't come on, I'm sure. I shall
faint!
Swiv. It was a curious sound!
Nip. Why it sounded to me just like-
[ The savages shout again.
Bless my heart! it is uncommonly ferrific! Where
shall we go ?—look, Swivel, they are savages, and are
coming this way!
Swiv. They come this way, sure enough.
Nip. Say your prayers, Swivel! for you have not
long to live.—Good bye? Swivel!
[Runs into the wood.
[ The Savages fly across the stttge, and appear
much alarmed.—Nipcheese makes his appear-
ance, and faces Pariboo, but retreats imme-
; diately.—Sivivel makes a blow at Pariboo; the
chief avoids it, and escapes while Nipcheese
drinks out of a case bottle.
Swiv. That was the chief!
Nip. Aye: and the others were his blackguards.
Swiv. They're a hearty set of lads.
Nip. Yes: and would no doubt like to make a
hearty meal upon a poor Buccanier!—do you know,
they quite alarmed me!
JSwiv. Nonsense! they jwere more frightened than
you.
[Robinson Crusoe enters, and seeing the strangers
pauses.
Cru. They are English; I must be careful.
[He enters the wood, and observes them,
Nip. I think they were a little alarmed at my ap-
pearance !—I wonder where Windlass is*- with the
prisoners.
Swiv. He'll soon be here: the woman perhaps has
been a little boisterous. But we must have still tongues
AVhen we enter a strange harbour.
Cru. (Aside) I imagine they are pirates.
Swiv. We must part Deigo from his mother.
Cru. Diego!—his mother !—Can this be reality?
Nip. I don't relish the idea; for they are in search of
a man who has been lost for a great many years:—let
me see; his name was
Swiv. Rob—Rob
Nip. Robinson
r> Swiv. Cru—I know there was a Cru in it!
Nip. So—so !—Crusoe!—Robinson Crusoe!—and I
say his wife is a woman of spirit, to travel the wide
world, in order to find her lost husband.
[A scuffle heard without, and a whistle.
Swiv. The signal!—Windlass is at hand; it was his
whistle. [Exit.
Nip. I'm sure of that!—Oh dear! oh dear! I wish
I had never turned mutineer! [Exit.
Cru. I am not deceived:—It is—it is reality!—To at-
tack them thus were folly:—I will watch the departure
of these ruffians, and then endeavour to release them.
[Exit into wood.
Diego. (Without) Traitor! desist!
Wind. ( Without) Peace! peace!—away with him!
[Inis and Deigo are in chains—the mutineers
drag them in—Windlass acts as their cap-
tain—Swivel and Nipcheese follow.
JDieg. If ye are men, attempt not to abuse an un-
offending woman !—I care not for myself; I appeal to
you for my mother !—Spare her!—save her! and I care
not how much you torture me.
Inis. My son, plead not for me:—they must not part
us; for we'll live or die together!
Wind. What ho! Nipcheese!
Nip. That's me!
Wind. Lead them up the bill, and take off their or-
naments :—out with your cheese-knife, if you do not
dread it.
Nip. There £—Fire and fuel! how I should like to
run my cheese-knife into his bread-basket!—Come! I
can't stand here! (assuming consequence) I must
away !—Poor things !—Go along—go!
Deig. Do not add insult to your cruelty, or- 
Nip. (Alarmed) Captain, remember what I am,
and beware of my vengeance!
10
Deig. Wretch! thus I will punish such insolence!
[Makes a blow at Nipckeese— Windlass and the
others interfere, and part them.
Inis. Conquer your spirit!—Heaven will still be-
friend us!
Wind. Away with them]
[Exeunt Swivel, Diego, Inis, and Nip cheese.
Now, lads, let me know how strong I am:—if you
stick to Jack Windlass, you shall hare an equal part of
all he gets: you shall sleep as long as you please, and
drink grog every night till you don't know stem from
stern!
Wind. Come along, lads; and Success to the bold
Buccaniers!
GLEE AND CHORUS.
Gome, come with the gale,
We will hasten on board,
Then cheerly set sail,
And the shiners we'll hoard:
For we know no terror,
We harbour no fear;
And the bravest of tars
Is the bold Buccanier.
[During the chorus, Pariboo appears, and watches
the mutineers as they go off.
SCENE III.
Robinson Crusoe9s Farm, (same as first scene.)
Robinson Crusoe, Friday, and Iglon enter.
Cru. Your advice is good: (to Friday:J as your
father is the chief of a tribe, he may soon return with
assistance.
Iglon. Certainly; and I am all impatience till the
commission is executed.
Cru. In that canoe he can cross to his native island;
and should the wind be prosperous, he may return
again by sun-rise to-morrow.
IT
Iglon. It can be done: I will use every effort; and
shall never think I have done enough for hiin who has
so nobly saved my life.
Fri. Look, massa, look !:—there is a stranger! and
him be coming dis way.
Cru. Let him pass, if he don't perceive us: he, per-
haps, may notbea partner in the mutiny. [Theyretireas
Bluff enters—he has a cudgel under his arm, and
a tobacco-box in his hand and sings,
Billy Taylor was a brisk younsj fellow,
Full of mirth and full of glee;
And his true love he did diskiver,
To a lady so fair a»d free.
Bluff. It's all no use: singing wont Mian empty
stomach!—Well, Fd rather starve a thousand times over,
than disgrace my flag?—What! turn mutineer, and be
tied up to the yard arm?—I don't like the thought at
all.—Never mind! I've got a quid of tobacco left yet;
aild Why who are you ?—where do you come from?
Cru. Do not avoid me!-—If I guess right, we are
both unfortunate; still we may be of service to each
other.
Bluff. Well! you're a rum figure, at any rate.
Cru. I am a sailor. (Advancing to him.)
Bluff. Sheer off!—I don't believe you!—If you dare
to come near me, I'll
[Bluff puts himself in a defensive attitude, at
which Friday and Jglon interpose.
Cru. Touch him not!
Bluff. You had better not; or I'll physic someof you,
I'll be bound.
Cru. Hear roe, countryman!—you have heard of
Crusoe.
Bluff. What, Robinson ?—Is it possible ?—Can it
be ?—Why surely it is!
Cru. Yes Diego's father—husband to Inis; boih of
whom are in captivity.
12
Bluff. Say no more! We'll scuttle some of their
nobs yet!
Cru. I have arms and ammunition: Friday, produce
them; and remember, they are all charged.
Bluff. 1 feel quite another man: I'll stick by yon,
mjbqy! [Friday and Iglon bring arms.
I suppose this is your loblolly boy.—Give us your hand,
my hearty!
[Shakes hands with Friday, and hurts him—
Iglon frowns, and dislikes it.
Cru. The mutineers will soon be here, and I will
tell you what must be done: we must pfotect Inis and
my son; or in the event of their being injured, we
must discharge our muskets.
Bluff. We must not fear them.
.. Cru. They may overpower us!
Bluff. I am under your command; and I want to
ask you one favor.
Cru. What is that?
Bluff. Don't you hurt Jack Windlass.
Cru. Why not?
Bluff. Because I want to do his business myself;
that's all.
Cru. They come!
Bluff. Then let's sheer off.
Enter Diego and Inis attended by Swivel and
Nipcheese.
Nip. T think this as fine a spot as any on the face
of the earth, for a man to live who is completely tired
of society^—what do you think, Swivel?
Swiv. Why I think it a very sweet place for sava*
ges: but when we Christians come here—^—- >
Nip* Christians!—Swivel, are you a christian?
Swiv. Yes, as a body may say: but why do yoxi
ask?
Nip. Because I shouldn't have known it9 if you
hadn't told me. .
&W /.v
13
Swiv. Now I'll take off your chains.
[To Diego and Inis.
Diego. ( To his mother) I will make one more des-
perate effort!
Inis. Believe me, it will be useless.
Diego. Hear me! once more hear me !—Remember,
one day you will be punished for this guilt and inhu-
manity !—Some in the vessel contemplated the crime
with abhorrence :•—think, therefore, what will be the
consequence of persevering;—inevitable destruction
must light upon you. But if you retrace your steps, I
promise, on my oath, to save you.
Swiv. What, would you corrupt us?
Nip. Aye—two brave men—would you corrupt us?
[Nipcheese steals off.
Swiv. I can't do so, Captain: I have began, and
now i must go on. [Exit.
Diego. It is done; and every hope is lost!
[Ctwsoe advances—Bluff endeavours to keep
him back.
Cru. I must speak to them!
Bluff. Don't frighten her: she might have though
you a handsome man once; but I assure you upon my
honor you're a very ugly man now.
Cru. Inis!
[Inis clasps her hands, and appears alarmed—
Diego starts.
Diego. What wonder is this?
Cru. It is I—Crusoe—your husband!
[Inis rushes forward, and they embrace each other.
Diego. It is my father!
Nip. (Peeping) Then your father is a proper fright!
Bluff. Captain!
Diego. What, Bluff here?
Bluff. Aye! ready to fight and die for you!—we are
not the strongest party; but if we only have a little
luck on our side, we may bring them to their senses
again.
Diego. Worthy fellow! if we succeed, you shall
be rewarded for your resolution.
14
Bluff. Jack Windlass the Gunner shall suffer yet:
and as for that rascal, Nipcheese, if I only clap ray
eyes upon him, I'll give him a belly full of bullets.
Nip. (In the tree) There's a chance for me!
Bluff. Ey!
Diego. What's the matter?
Bluff. Somebody spoke.
Cru. We delay! {Gives Friday a cutlass) Friday,
prepare!—Now attend:—unless we can take their party
by surprise, we cannot succeed: be not too quick; but
wait for my signal before you fire.---Friday, you will
be courageous.
FrL Me no fear now, massa; you have thundered
so much.
Cru, L$t all conceal themselves.
Bluff, V% hide myself in that hollow tree.
[Nipcheese is frightened.
Crut (Sdeing Inis armed with an axe) Inis, you
are armed.
Inis. I am!—and should the event require it, you
need not doubt my resolution. [A whistle is heard.
Bluff. Do you hear that?
Fri. (Who has mounted the tree) They are very
near, massa.
Wind. (Without) Hilloah! hilloah!
Block. ( Without) Why, where have they got to?
[ Windlass enters, followed by the others.*-* The
seamen place the chest and bags under the
tree. S
Block (Sees the fetters) Oh, there are the deco-
rations!
Wind: I don't relish this at all!—Who is with the
boat?
Block. Gunwale and the Cockfc&ain,
Wind. Swivel's all right; but I think we had better
hang Nipeheese.
Nip. Vm hangM if you do!
Block. It's no use to call them.
Wind. We want Swivel: or we might leave them
both to their fate.
15
Block. True: but we cannot do without Swivel; so
we must fire in the air, and let them know we are wait-
ing for them.
[ They place themselves immediately in rank and
point in different directions.
Wind. Higher! higher! In the air, lads!
[ When they discharge their pieces,
Cru. Charge! Charge!
[Crusoe'sparty rushforward— Windlass encoun-
ters Crusoe, and the others defend themselves—
Inis rescues her husband—Bluff cudgels the
Mutineers—Friday overpowers Windlass—
Crusoe's party are victorious.
ACT THE SECOND.
SCENE IV .
The Interior of Crusoe's cave.—A Lamp hangs at
the side.
Diego, Crusoe, and Inis discovered.
Cru. It took me some time to construct this dwell-
ing.—For a long time I dwelt here without seeing a
single human being; and from the entrance of my
cave have viewed the point where every soul on board
the vessel perished but myself.
Diego. But how did you contrive to make yourself
master of so many implements of war?
Cru. I saved them from the wreck of the vessel,
which for months held together.—Beneath yon table is
my powder magazine; and in yon dungeon I have re-
posed for years.
Diego. But it is very dark and damp!
Cru. True: But it has two separate outlets among
the rocks leading to the beach; and in the event of
B2
JG
being surprised, escape became certain. But we must
prepare: and to commence, we must secure every thing
that may be of service.
[Crusoe goes into the dormitory—Inis follows, but
stops at the entrance, and falls on the neck of
Diego.
Diego. Fear not! the villains are confined, and
guarded by the faithful black.
Cru. Now we may depart : and you Diego can
protect this casket.—But Friday must not be forgotten.
Bluff. {Without)—Hilloah! hilioah!
Diego. We are cailM!
Bluff enters.
What news, Bluff?
Bluff. Very bad—I fell in with the enemy, and was
obliged to sheer off.
Cru. But the boat?
Bluff- Was sunk in action.
Diego. Then all is destroyed!
Bluff. Don't say so :—it may not be half so bad as
you suppose.
Diego. What do you mean?
Bluff. I fell in with Gunwale and his beautiful
cockswain: so thinking I could manage them, I made
ready for action.
Diego. Well!
Bluff. I no sooner began, than I espied two more.
Now what's to be done? says I:—one is but one: and so
thinking of the boat, I stove a plank in her bottom-
sunk her—jump'd overboard, and kept up a warm fight
without getting injured: and here I am!
Diego. But they may regain the boat.
Bluff. TheyshaVt!—but we may;—at low water
she'll be as dry as a bone.
Cru. How far did they pursue you?
Bluff. Close under the land here.
jDiegQ. WJmk were they?
17
Bluff, Swivel, and that old thief, Nipcheese: I gave
him two or three little ones for himself.
Cru. At any rate we are equal then.
Bluff. Equal! Bless your heart, your loblolly boy
could eat Nipcheese.
[The dog barks—and Friday rushes in,
Cru. What now, Friday?
Fri. Bad man escape, massa!
Bluff. Loose! This looks queer!
Diego. We are lost, I fear!
Cru. Should we be in danger, remember the Secret
Pass!—You, Diego, hasten and make a fire on the rock,
it will direct Iglon and his friends to the spot.
Diego. What is my mother to do?
Cru. Remain here with Friday.—Bluff and myself
will in the mean time endeavour to decoy the traitors
to some favourable spot.—Away, away! and remember
my orders.
[Friday having opened the trap, hands up cart-
ridges—Inis clings to Diego—Crusoe leaves
the cave—Friday closes the trap, and extin-
guishes the lamp—Inis sinks on the rock—the
Moon is sinking behind the trees without, and
Nipcheese appears at the entrance.
Nip. Well, I am all safe at last!—how I signalized
myself in the battle!—I have been beat by one party;
condemned to death by the other:—So now, in order to
give myself a little new life, I'll have a drop of thfs
precious liquor!
[Friday conceals himself.
I think somehow this is Crusoe's cave:—I hope he is
out.—I wonder what is in this box!
Fri. Oh, you great rogue!
Nip. Who call'd me?-^-Pm sure my name was men-
tioned!
Swiv. ( Without) What ho !—Nipcheese!
Nip. That's Swivel!—I'll pocket this!—Ey? why
there's Inis—Lud! oh, lud !—I'm as dead as Daw!
B3'
IS
Swivel and Gunwale enter.
Swiv. Well, have you found him out?
Nip. I have—for he's not at home.
Swiv. But here'shis wife:—Say,where is the captain?
Inis. The captain is safe on board the vessel.
Swiv. And where is Crusoe?
Inis. He is at hand.—Swear to restore me to my
son, and I not only promise you my favor, but a mine of
wealth \~-(4side)-~If I can deceive them, alimay yet
be well.--Look! look! [Skews the casket
Swiv. Is all that mon ey?
Gun. Gold, as I live!
Nip. She don't say a word about the jewels!
[ The seamen open the box, and stare with as-
tonishment.
Swiv. Is there more?
Inis. More! Aye, a hundred times as much.
Swiv. The boatswain's nothing to us.
"Nip. No!—let every man think for himself. But
how to get the vessel off!—the boat is lost!—Oh, Til tell
you : we must sleep in the wood.
Swiv. True: and at daybreak hail the vessel.
{Friday lets the lid of the chest fall—Inis
screams.
Nip. What was that?
Inis. OM nothing!—the table.
[Friday is behind the chest.
Nip. But under the table there's a cell.
Gun. Then we'll examine it:—and you keep guard,
Nipcheese!
[Gunwale and Swivel descend.
Nip. Yes: and.we share equally, remember!—Oh!
they're down, and I must follow, or while I'm guarding
here, they'll cheat me below.
[Nipcheese descends—Friday pushes him down
the trap—and' '"'
19
Bluff enters.
Bluff. Away! away! you must begone instantly—
Crusoe is taken!—Come, come!
Wind. ( Without) Force him this way!
Cru. ( Without) Oh, my wife, my wife!
[Bluff enters the Secret Pass—Inis runs to
Crusoe—Nipcheese ascends, and is seized by
Friday; he likewise attacks Gunwale—then
Swivel ascends—Nipcheese is tumbled into
the chest—Swivel flies—Friday being dis-
armed, gains a pistol, and shoots the mutineer,
then jumps on the chest and gazes on the body
as scene closes.
SCENE V.
Part of the Cedar Wood.
The Canibal Chief, Pariboo, appears.
Pari. They have left me here without the hope of
gaining my native island: still Pariboo will never de-
part till he has punished the presumption of him who
has been the cause of placing him in such a situation!
Bluff enters.
Bluff. Well, Ihavereached this spot in safety.—Poor
Crusoe! Poor Inis! there seems to be very little but
vexation in store for them! ( Voices witlvout.) Hark!
they approach!—I will seek the captain, and have one
more trial, if I perish in the attempt. [Exit Bluff.
{The mutineers enter quarreling with Windlass.
Wind. Oh, if you wish it, do!—but this I tell you, if
you save their lives, mind you do not forfeit your own!
Swiv. If we injure them, I am sure we shall suffer
for it.
Block. Pooh! you talk nonsense!—the captain is
nothing to us; and as for Bluff, while we arc the
strongest party, who cares for Bluff?
20
Wind. But our people must have been overpowered;
and if they know it—(asicfe.)—I tell you what, lads:
we can build a small vessel in a month.
Szmv. Oh, there's a pretty affair for you!
[Mutineers murmur.
Wind. Then, in order to get the vessel again, we
must let Diego know that his father and mother are in
our power, and he will never attempt to sail without us.
MuL There's something in that.
Wind. Well, away, my lads.
Mut. Bear a hand! away, lads!
Wind. A set of discontented knaves! [Exeunt.
SCENE VI.
A Part of the Coast.
In the front is a pole with this inscription, "/
was cast on this island, September, S0th. 1659.
Robinson Cetjsoe."—On thelefta rock overlooking
the sea—on the right a wood.
Diego is discovered lighting a fire.—Bluff enters
to him.
Bluff. Diego! Captain!
Diego. Bluff here?—then all is well!
Bluff. Have any of the friendly Indians been here?
Diego. No.
Bluff. That fire must be extinguished.—Oh, here
comes blackee!
Enter Friday.
Fri. Oh massa Diego, here is my father—here is
Iglon.
Iglon and his Warriors enter.
Iglon. Diego, my friends are here to fight for you
and Crusoe, and are determined never to forsake your
cause.
21
[The Indians enter, and Btuff receives them
with joy.
Fri. Massa Diego, my father has brought you some
men who are not afraid of the thunder.
Diego. That's right! but some one approaches: con-
ceal yourselves!—Quick! quick!
[They conceal themselves.
Nipcheese enters, drunk.
Nip. Everybody is my enemy !—First I met a lot of
savages—then I was to be hanged—but I dare say
worse than that will take place ; for they'll not be con-
tented till they send me back to Mrs. Nipcheese!
(Goes up to where Bluff is—Binff presents a pistol.}
Another incident!—Don't fire! and you'll much oblige
me!—
Bluff. Be quiet—or die!
[Nipcheese tries to get away—the Indians sur-
round him—Diego and Friday prevent him
from being ill treated.
Diego. Tell me instantly all you know about the
mutineers!—Where's my mother?
Nip. In the cavern.
Diego. And Windlass!
Nip. He'll be here very soon.
Diego. What does he intend to do?
Nip. To make somebody swim to the ship: and I
will join your party if you'll pardon me.
Diego. I agree: but, if you again prove treacherous,
you shall die!—So away! let them secure their captives,
and then you must decoy them to this spot.
Fri. Here comes massa Crusoe. [They all retire.
The Mutineers enter, with Crusoe and Inis bound.
Wind. Swivel, make signal to the ship.
[Iglon tries to cut the ropes that bind the pri-
soners—the parrot perches on the tree where
Crusoe is bound, and cries> "Poor Robin!
Poor Robin Crusoe /''
22
Wind. What did you say?
Nip. I didn't speak.
Wind. But I'm sure you did!
Parrot. Friday! poor Friday!
Wind. There again!
Nip. I hav'n't opened my lips.
Swiv. They return the signal—the boat puts off!
[ The Indians having collected boughs, encompass
the captives, and move off with them.
. Wind. The prisoners have escaped!—pursue! pursue!

and Inis are secured by the mutineers—Fri-

SCENE VII.
A Picturesque View of the Sea-shore from beneath a
Shed built by Crusoe.
Diego and Inis enter followed by Crusoe, Iglon and:
Friday, with Indians and Mutineers.
Cru, To this worthy chief we owe our success.--
Friday, now I have to claim your last duty—prepare
for my departure.
Friday. No, no; you will not part!—you cannot,
massa, leave your Friday!
Cru. Then I will not: Friday shall accompany me.
Bluff. And, master, speak to these kind-hearted mu-
tineers.
Cru. I will; and by administering mercy, 1 trust
they will make the best use of it. In this island they
have every means of comfort; let them live—endeavour
to deserve—and they may yet die contented.
Nip. (Enters) And, Bluff, I hope you'll say a good
word for me!
Bluff. Why, master, he's Jack of both sides, and of
no use to either.
Diego. He is forgiven!
Nip. Bless you, sir—bless you! And master Friday
here are a few more of your relations coming.
Cru. Friday, conduct your friends, and then ail
hands onboard!
[ The Indians bear Crusoe's various articles off
in procession—then they bear Crusoe and his
dog off in a litter, and sing the following
CHORUS.
Do not stay,
Haste away,
We must all be jolly;
We from strife,
WTill finish life,
For grieving is a folly.
All on board,
Is now the word,
Every thing we'll put in motion;
Do not stay,
But haste away,
We'll cross the foaming ocean.
Do not stay, &c.

Drama.
