" Chicago.u (By kind permission of Miss Vesta Tilley.)
Enter Snooks, the Landlord.
Snooks (to Crowd).
Here ! What's all this about? You fellows working?
Instead of in the public houses lurking ! .
How is a licensed victualler to pay
His rates and taxes if you work all day ?
While that's going on, there can no drinking be,
Which, you'll admit, is very hard on me.
Live and let live's my motto !
ist Labourer. # Yes, quite so!
But where's our living coming from ?
Snooks {winking). p" know !
. Experience by this time must have taught you
B
That if you strike the public will support you !
Find you in ev'rything—coals, togs and grub !
Long live the Public ! (Going towards Inn),
Snooks (pointing to Inn—aside). And long live the Pub !
(Miss Perky, the Barmaid, appears at Inn door.)
What means this sudden rush of business, eh ?
We want some drinks !
And who is going to pay ?
The Public ! Barmaid, let us have some beer !

1ST L. Come on, my lads-—to eat, to drink and smoke !
Omnes (rushing to Inn). Hooray !
Snooks I almost wish I hadn't spoke! (Exeunt to Inn,)
Miss P. Well, now you've done it—p'raps you're satisfied !
Snooks. It's not a great success—but still, 1 tried !
Miss P. " Hoist with your own petard ! "--it's hard !
Snooks # Pet—hard—er
Still, to think they're ransacking the larder !
I'm ruined, stony-broke !
 Robinson Crusoe (Miss Ada Blanche).
Miss P. If that's the ?ase
I'd better look out for another place !
Snooks. What! would you leave me now I've come to grief.
(Snivellin °",)
Oh ! this Is dreadful—where's my handkerchief?
I thought you liked me !
Miss P. Well /thought so, rather I
But now, you see—
Snooks (putting his arm round her waist suddenly)—I love you I

{Enter Polly.)
Polly. Hallo, Father!
How are we going on now? You gay old flirt!
(To Miss P.)
And as for yon, you minx.
Miss P. Come, don't be pert !
Polly. What do you mean by going on like this ?
Snooks. Silence, child !
Polly. Sha'n't !
Miss P. Pd make you !
Polly. Madam !
Miss P. Miss!
Snooks (Tea ring his hair, &c.).
This is too much ! I feel I can't go through it!
I think perhaps Pd better leave you to it !
(Exit.)
Polly (to Miss P.).
This is delightful ! But don't go too far,
Do you suppose you'll ever be my Ma?
Miss P. I shouldn't wonder !
Polly. Well, you won't then, see ?
Though goodness knows you're old enough to be ?
Miss P. Thank you, I'm sure !
I'olly. Don't mention it, my dear !
There, go and draw the customers their beer,
And keep your place !
Mlss p- Ha ! ha ! You little know
That there's no place to keep ! You're ruined ! "' ~
Polly. 0h,
How long has that been ?
Mlss p- ^ It's but just occurred!
Polly. They're smashing up the house !
Miss P. ^ Upon my word,
I'm sorry for you, dear!
PoLLY- ^ I'm sure of that!
Miss P. What will you do ? You've no friends, have you ?
Polly (aside). £at ,
Miss P. And won't that fellow, Crusoe, be upset
To find you've got no money! He'll forget
His vow of love.
PoLLY> , Ah ! spare such words as these !
Don t say such things about my Crusoe, please !
Miss P. We mustn't hurt each other's feelings, eh ?
Polly. I shall hurt something soon !

 Will Atkins (Mr. IL ih-u <
Polly. Now, Polly, Polly, keep your temper clear,
Or rather, lose it, for it's very clear
It's not worth keeping— get another one,
And all these bickerings and quarrels shun !
There may be troubles coming by-and-by,
Which you're to conquer, if you will but try!

We are agreed ?

But our special line of trade is
The abducting of young ladies—
And we've got a job on hand to-day !
Just so !
All is prepared ?
Just so !
Plunder be shared ?
Just so !
I see to that— the girl you'll seize !
Once the lugger she's aboard of
She'll be mine, her own accord of
(Though that's not the very latest wheeze).
Oh no!
Mr. Atkins, don't it seem to strike you
That this strange behaviour may make folks chi-ike you ?
We've not been noticed, have we ? These disguises
Made up of odds and ends—all sorts and sizes,
When we go on this kind of expedition
Are calculated to disarm suspicion.
My friends, one word !
. You understand?
{shouting). We do,
I'd give the thing away if I were you !
You're Myrmidons, you know—as such, don't yell,
But let your words be murmured uns as well!
And now to seize the girl! You will, of course
Use only just the necessary force.
We've pillows that her shriekings may be stifled with;

Atkins.
And these may prove that we will not be trifled with !
Here is the chloroform ! {Produces enormous bottle.)
Some ropes and chains
To bind her with ! And now if she complains
That we've not done our best and asks for more
This is really not the girl I take her for!
Will this succeed ? Or am I going too far?
  Captain and mate (the Poluskis).
Oh ! Atkins, what an awful man you are!
It comes a little irksome, so to speak
To be a villain just twelve times a week !
What of it, though ? 'Tis villainy that pays

But courage! For this work I must go through,
But if I love the girl—

Good morning, William, dear!
Good morning, ma'am !
You seem a bit " down"-ish !
Yes, I am !
Well, surely / can cheer you up a bit—
Am I not by your side ?
Yes, that's just it!
He loves me ! I can see it in his
(Atkins turns away)
back!
Of fascinating me he's caught the knack !
Look at that noble chest ! How it dilates !
Ain't he got lovely legs ! And oh ! his plates !
Who could resist a being such as that?
I wonder who she thinks she's getting at?
Away, reserve ! I'll be no longer coy !
Say, will you be a father to my boy ?
(struggling).
Not much ! I won't! Old party, don't be silly !
You'll have to be, though, willy-nilly, Billy.
How do you make that oui ?
I know your plan
For carrying Miss Polly off, my man.
Well, if you know, I needn't tell you, eh, mum ?
Oh, do not say you spurn me !
Go away, mum !
I won't! I mean to be your very own !
It is not good for man to be alone !
Nor women either !
Will you kindly shift ?
I wouldn't take you as a loan—or gift!
Then you despise me ?
Well, my dear good soul,
I rather think I do, upon the whole.
You shall repent this !
Oh, don't make a fuss !
This sort of thing is nonsense between us/
Come, have a drink ! There's something in this measure,
And drink success, ma'am, to " A Life of Pleasure."
Was it for this, then, that you brought me here ?
Your words into my brain will burn-hard (sniffs at tankard)
Beer !
False, cruel, heartless, born but to betray !

A cad, a brute, a wretch !
Oh, come, I say !
He offers me this drink ! D'ye think I'd taste it!
'Tis thus I drink to him ! No, I won't waste it!
As to the girl, to gain whom you endeavour,
Now go to her, I've done with you for ever !
That's off my mind ! A pleasant journey, mum !
And now to seize the girl !
(Exit Atkins.)
{Enter Crusoe.)
Crusoe. Another day of trouble, I suppose,
Has dawned for me ! Can I, before its close
Find nothing in the way of work to do ?
Or must I simply " lounge" the whole day through !
If it were not for Polly's love for me
I should despair, but no ! that must not be !
I must do something her dear hand to win
As I have won her heart ! But how begin !
Oh for the means to make my love my wife
And I will ask no more !
Mrs. C. (in dock). Ha ! What a life !
Crusoe. That sounds familiar!
Mrs. C. Will some one or other
Come to my rescue !
Crusoe. What! is that you, Mother ?
Where are you ?
Mrs. C. In the mud, above my knees !
Crusoe. All right! I'll pull you out, old girl! .
Mrs. C. Do, please.
Crusoe. But tell me, Mother, how did you come there ?
Mrs. C. You don't suppose for fun, or change of air !
But if you'll pull me out, I will explain
And if you don't—
Crusoe. Well, there you will remain !
Mrs. C. When I get out, I'll give you such a slap !
Crusoe. Well, come, that should encourage a poor chap.
Mrs. C. (lying helpless on Quay side) >
I'm in a nice state ! And I'm nearly stifled with !
And more than that—my feelings have been trifled with !
But I will be revenged ! No time I'll lose !
But first I think I'd better change my shoes !
Crusoe. Now, Mother, you are safe ! So let's discuss !
Things don't look well!
Mrs. C. (looking at her feet). They couldn't look much wuss !

Mrs. C. Am I all right behind ?
Crusoe. I'll win a name—and all my bad luck crush.
And come back rich and great.
Mrs. C (looking at skirt). That wants a brush !
Crusoe. To mend my fortunes I should go, Ha?
Yes!
You mend your fortune ! (Looking at tear in skirt).
While I mend my dress.
Exit Mrs. C.
Ma is enthusiastic in the matter !
But there—the world's before me !

Folly (fallingon knees to Atkins).
Oh, save me ! Ah ! You ! Then I know my fate !
Say you'll be mine, before it is too late!
If I refuse ?

That's somewhat of the " chestnut " order, eh?
But it's effective, so—Avast! Belay !
I sha'n't. I want to make this maiden " mine."
Well, she's engaged ! Look up, love; give some sign /
Where am I ? {Reviving.)
In the Crusoe's Arms.
Polly (nestling to him). I see !
Atkins (aside). And that's a sign she won't belong to me !

Oh, that won't do !
I think I'm going to win !
And what can you ?
Why, don't you know a fortune I have made ?
I've been connected with the smuggling trade.
I've a large stock on hand, which would be pleasant
To any lady as a wedding present.
Tobacco, gunpowder, and casks of rum !
And if you'll say the word, they're yours, so come !
It's very tempting ! But, if you don't mind,
I'd rather wed my Robinson !

Oh ! sweetheart mine, tell me, I pray !
Rob. No, dearest, no! true love can never cruel be !
'Tis gentle as the sunlight ray
And lives till life has passed away.
Both (?) So hand in hand, and heart to heart, for ever side by
side;
Fondly loving, trusting, no matter what betide ;
Many years pass by, that like a day may seem
Till the time shall come, that ends our happy dream !

Rob. But, love, this happiness for us cannot yet be

Press Gang (seizing Crusoe).
We require an able seaman,
And beyond a doubt you're the man,
So come away, my bully boy, to sea !
Let us have no hesitating,
For His Majesty is waiting,
And to have you serve him, anxious as can be !
So don't stand there and blubber,
Like a Molly Colly lubber,
But come and serve your country, staunch and true.
Rob. C. (recovering himself).
This is really most distressing,
And since you are so " press "-ing
It's perhaps the very best thing I can do.
Rob. My Polly, I must say good-bye to—
But dry your tears, now do, love,
I'll win a fortune, or I'll try to,
And bring it home to you, love !
Polly. But foreign countries thus to fly to—

Vain fortune to pursue, love—
I think it silly !—
Mrs. C. So do /, too,
So stay at home and " woo " love !
Oh, Robinson Crusoe !
You'll shortly be looking quite blue, so
Pray love, stay love,
Or this sort of thing you will rue, so.
Atkins. But he daren't refuse, so
There's no other place he can choose, so
Don't you give way, you'll be all right some day
If you don't take on the booze, so !

Occasionally " sling-slang."
But if anybodv worries him, he'll fire his gun off " bing-

All the way from Rotherhithe to Japan !
Atkins. The ship must sail to-day
And when he's gone away
I'll quite knock out that bounder there !

Am I the Captain of this ship, eh ?

We'll see to that!

Of course we'll spend it with our sweethearts ! What?
Why, bless their hearts ! and let them have the lot.
I'll have some fun to-night, boys, if I live.

His mother calling on me every day
To tell me that her son went off" to sea
And left his happy home because of me !

That's pleasant! And to add to all the fun
Will Atkins swears that we must soon be "one."

But stand aside for " bits of girls " like you ?
Are you addressing your remarks to me ?

You be here by yourself, and so, my pet
I've come to stay with you!
Polly. You're very kind
But I would be alone if you don't mind !

Polly (holding her up). Don't ! Save me !
Mks. C. How?
Polly. I don't know?
Mrs. C. ' It you don't,
Why should I ?
Polly. But you must, though !
Mrs. C. No, I won't !
Oh yes, I will! At last I see my chance !
Now, Mr. Atkins, you've led me a dance,
I'll lead you one ! You go in there ! What's this?
Now for my great revenge ! Ha, ha ! What bliss !
Atkins {looking round). Ah, the old woman's gone ! Well, she can
wait!
Now for the girl!
Mrs. C.. Help!
••y^iNs. Ha ! you call too late !
Polly (peeps in cautiously).
That was a very friendly thing to do,
She's very kind—disinterested too !
And now to pack—and the first ship that starts
I'll book my passage in for foreign parts.
Now that I've quite made up my mind to go
48
In search of Robinson, I don't quite know
If I am sad or glad to leave my home.
Good gracious ! I forgot my brush and comb !
Good-bye, dear little room—for many a day
I never packed my powder-puff away !
Good-bye, each treasure that to me belongs.
I don't believe I packed my curling-tongs !
I feel disheartened ! Oh, what shall I do ?
Mrs. C. It hasn't come off ! (Sees Polly.)
Well, what's wrong with you ?
Polly. I'm sad at leaving home.
Mrs C. That mustn't be,
You won't be lonely, dear, while you have me !
Polly. You're surely not going too ?
Mrs. C. I am, my dear.
Polly. The voyage will upset you.
Mrs. C. Oh ! no fear !
I look upon it as a picnic quite !
Now let us see that everything is right.
Here's a nice crab, some apples, soap and tow'l,
A pair of sand-shoes and a half a fowl.
Here's pepper, salt, and mustard, knife and fork,
An umbrella, and a hand of pork !
A looking-glass in which to take a "glimpse,"
A box of choc'lates, and a pint of shrimps !
I think that's all we'll want.
Polly. Yes, quite enough.
Mrs. C. We'll hz prepared \i it should come on rough.
We may be ill ere very far we've gone,
So we'll eat something, just to work upon 1
Polly. Oh, I can't touch a bit!
Mrs. C. You must, now ; come, come
Never go sailing on an empty " turn turn !"

Polly. ^ What is it, Dad ?
Snooks. I've brought you some good news !
Polly. Oh, I'm so glad !
(Opens door a?id lets Mr. Snooks and Miss Perky in).
Snooks. Something important has been picked up.
Polly. Where?
Snooks. Try and guess what it is !

Snooks, (producing enormous bottle). Well there !
Mrs. C. Is that for me?

^jwS p Oh no, there's nothing In it.
So you won't want it.
Mr* C. SaucY thing!
Snooks. One minute.
Upon the shore for weeks this bottle lay
And no one noticed it until to-day.
And then we thought it might contain some new
We opened it, and found it full of—

Snooks. No tidings of young Crusoe ! How he's cast
Upon a desert island !
Polly. Found ! at last!

Atkins. I've heard the news ! So I must be in this !
I've done you wrong, but if you will be friends
I'll do all in my power to make amends!
So by my ship, we'll start within an hour !
Is it agreed ?
Omnes. It is !

And we will never part again !
How could'st thou ever leave me, love?

Crusoe's Island.
(Ryan.)
Enter Friday.
Friday. Well, here I am at last! In my canoe
I've paddled here across the ocean blue
To seek adventures in this lively spot:—
And somehow the impression I have got
That I shall meet my little sweetheart here.
But she may disappoint me yet, I fear.
To hear my vows of love she seems inclined
But when she will—she can't make up her mind !
Song.—" She'll meet me when the weather's more settled."
Friday. Can it be, after all, her love's a sham ?
Has she deceived me ?
Enter the Queen.
Queen. Sweet one ! Here I am !
Where have you been ? I've sought you all the day.
And now I've got you !
Friday (struggling). Oh, look here, I say I
Is this affection or annoyance ?
Queen (puts him down). What ?
You know my love is warm !
Friday (rubbing himself). \ think it's hot
But is this quite respectable, you know ?
Queen. The King has got a lot of wives, and so
I'll have a lot of husbands—that's but fair.
Friday. But this may lead to trouble—
QUEEN- I don't care !
But still I will be cautious !
S3
Friday. Yes, pleased/
Queen. So I commence, my dear, by choosing you!
I'll have as many husbands as I please,
And thus I'll be revenged ! But by degrees !
Friday. Where is the King and suite ?
Queen. Don't think of them !
They're far away ! and we are now—
Enter the King.
King. Ahem !
Queen (starting aiuay from Friday).
It's lovely weather, isn't it ?
Friday. Ah, yes !
{Aside.)
It strikes me we are in a pretty mess !
(Airily walking away.)
Well, now, I'll say good morning I
King. Oh, don't go 1
Friday. I beg your pardon !
King. Not at all!
Friday. Just so !
King. We'll have a little conversation, Sir 3
You know this lady ?
Friday. Yes !
King. So I infer !
But / have not the honour—Never mind !
I shall know all about you soon, you'll find !
Friday. And how is that!
King (becko?iing on his suite).
Because I'm going to eat you!
Friday. I knew it! Oh, great King.
King (bowing). I'm charmed to meet you 1
Queen. You do not think of eating him for dinny ?
Kix<;. I do indeed!
Friday. But look, I'm very skinny !
There's very little of me !
Kixg. Yes, that's true
And by and by, there will be less of you !
Hiday. I'm sure to make you queer, Sir!
King (To attendants.) Not a bit !
There ! no more words ! Quick ! take him to the spit.
Friday. I must admit now that all hope is flown

I'm reconciled to fate !
Dear me, what's this ?
A footprint ? Then I have been wrong to call
This place a desert island after all!
Why, it's inhabited ! This blow is stunning !
If this is/w«, oh, sea-shore, cease your funning !
But no, it's real! A footprint!
That is flat—
A pretty little foot it is —
What's that ?
A black man chased by others comes this way !
I'll save him ! Boom, we're in for " larks " to day !
Protect me ! and I'll be your humble slave !
I know you will! for you look good and brave !
And if I live, I'll do as white men do !
I'll sometimes wash ! and put on clothes like you !
I'll wear high collars, boots, and smoke cigars !
And drink, and flirt with ladies over bars!
I'll turn day into night, and shout and sing,
The latest comic songs, and front bells ring,
And wrench off knockers, and assault the p'lice
And get bound over too, to keep the peace !
Save me ! All this I'll do ! You'll be surprised,
How soon this Savage will be civilized !
You speak English !
Yes!
A missionary taught it me, I guess !
He must have been a good man !
{chuckling). Yes, he was !
I nebber knew a better ?
Why?

After he'd taught me everyfing he knew

Grateful thing to do !

King. Who's arranged this for us ? Somehow I feel
Just like a sieve—all holes ! And where's our meal ?
P. M. He has escaped, Sir !
King. You must catch him, please !
P. M. (stiffly walking).
But I can't walk with anything like ease
And as to running ! Sir, I must refuse you !
King (savagely). What! (makes an effort to move—stops in pain).
If you feel as /do, I'll excuse you!
57
Of lumps of things I seem to have a head full!
(To Queen with mock sympathy.)
How are you feeling, sweet one?
Queen (crying). Something dreadful !
King. D'ye feel a sort of " tingling " ?
Queen. Yes, I do !
King. Where do you feel it most?
Queen. What's that to you ?
King. Won't you sit down a minute?
Queen (going to do so—thinks better of it).
Not just yet.
King (sneeringly).
You've had a little disappointment, pet,
YouVe lost your dinner, and you feel it rather,
But never mind—we still have got his father!

To cook him in the place of him who's flown !
And till he's ready—I would be alone ! .«

I've never realised them until now !
Mrs. C. Well, we must mike the best of things! Oh, dear !
Where's Polly and the others?

Atkins. Well, I fear
They've gone down with the ship.
Mrs. C. Thank goodness ! No-
I mean—thank goodness we are saved !
Atkins. Just so,
Beneath my grief that satisfaction lurks.
It's not so dreadful under all the circs.
Topical Duet and Exeunt.
" We don't know where we are" (Published by Howard & Co., Great
Marlborough Street.
Written by Geoffrey Thorn.
Atkins. We've come alive, from the ocean, like the merry little
bloater or the smelt.
Mrs. C. Both saved from the raging billows, by wearing of a
Harness belt.
Atkins. Together we clung to the Home Rule Bill, for it was out-
only mast,
Mrs. C. When a wave they called, the British House of Lords, came
and knocked us off our perch at last.
Atkins. We tried Employer's Liabilitee, 'twas, you see our only
spar.
Mrs. C. And we tried to float ourselves ashore, but sank down
where the Parish Councils are.
Chorus.
Mrs. C. Wet through, and without a blessed farden, on this desert
island all alone.
Atkins. Not dressed in the latest fashion, but what we have is ev'ry
bit our own.
Mrs. C. Not a soul to guide us~to the nearest liquoring bar;
Atkins. Since Dave Jones chucked us on this island with a splosh,
why, we don't know where we are.
Polly. There, father, dear ! you're saved I
A few more spanks, dear !

Polly. I can't help feeling, now that I'm alone
A little bit disheartened, Imust own.
And worst of all, before I came away
I tried to learn some French, because they say
It's always useful, and I learnt a lot,
But it's no good, in this deserted spot,
For nobody can hear me ! It's a shame ! ^
But I will keep it up though, all the same .

Mrs. C. Oh ! {feels her heart) what is this feeling that is stealing
over me—something went " pop "—was it my stay-
lace ?—or was it love at first sight?
Crusoe. Love at first sight, mother—don't be ridiculous—an old
married woman like you.
Mrs. C. Ah, you say that because I was your poor father's wife —
but know, child, there was no love lost between the
late Mr. Crusoe and me—your mother—I say there
was no love lost, and especially on Saturday night—
and why do I say so ?—because there was no love to
lose—there might have been a broken head, or an eye
or a nose or a few teeth lost—but how should a bit
of a boy like you talk of love—of first love with me—
an old experienced hand ? No, I tell you—I know it—
because I feel it, as I have felt it on many occasions
before. This is the first love—love at first sight—
undenying, undying, irresistible love—love that makes
the world go round—love that makes my head swim-
as if it was drowning—in whisky like.

And when we get him, won't we dust his jacket!

I'll sit upon this sack and wait. Sit down, my dear.
Captain. Quick, we must save young Crusoe !
Mate. That's all right.
But how to do it? I'm too weak to fight.
Captain. Why we will dress up in our camel's skin
And go there with these savages. Get in !
Kino. There's something wrong about those sacks !
Queen. Dear me !
They've disappeared. WTherever can they be?

You must perform before you go away!

And if we have, please take from me the cue, so!
And say you're pleased with Polly and her Crusoe.

Must very soon satisfied be !
Snooks. What shall I do ! May I come too ?
I'd like to be getting ashore ;
Miss P. Wherever you go—I'll follow, you know
I'll never be leaving you more !
Mrs. C. Upon my word : I never heard
Such impudence like it before !
Rob. Our piece is played
This roving blade,
Of lovely grade
By beauty swayed,
Who disobeyed
His parents staid,
In grief arrayed
By fortune's aid.
In love and trade
Success has made !

"Marguerite."
Rob (to King). We are greeting you in England, gladly.
Omnes. We are greeting you in England, gladly.
(They knock him about in their exuberance.)
King. Me thus to greet is very kind, I know,
But still I really wish you wouldn't greet me so.
"'Appy 'Ampstead"
Snooks. But sha'n't we have a high old time,
Just take the tip from me.
Miss P. We'll take our dusky friend about
Old London town to see !
Mrs. C. Their savage minds shall be impressed
With all they see, you bet,
Atkins. But there's one place above them all
That we must not forget,
That's 'Ampstead, 'Appy, 'Appy 'Ampstead.
That's the Cockney's Paradise,
And the fun, and at the price,
Oh 'Ampstead's very 'ard to beat,
If you want a beano it's a fair old treat !
Chicago."
(Everybody delighted, shaking each other's hands,
patting each other's back, 6°<r, &C.)
Omnes. I thank you very much I'm sure,
For all that you have done !
We've had some splendid fun
All throughout the vessel's "run,"
And I think the Captain of the Ship,
You should invite to take a " snip "
As soon as he has got ashore the cargo !

swears fealty to the King's daughter. A Banquet is then ordered—Cooks

Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who had once been one of the
King's favourites, took the lead in a rebellion. The King and barons were
continually making treaties, the conditions of which were broken as soon as

a very violent manner, on which the Chief Justice ordered him to be taken

was related to the King, he exclaimed—" Happy the Monarch who possesses
a Judge so resolute in the discharge of his duty, and a son so willing to

Wolsey for the present, and notices the Queen's Lady of Honour, Anne
Boleyn, flirts with her, and suddenly expresses his opinion that his marriage
with Catharine of Aragon was not legal, and asks Wolsey about it. Wolsey
says it is, the King turns his back and goes to Cranmer, who dissolves the
marriage. Catharine of Aragon goes for, succour to Wolsey. Wolsey
