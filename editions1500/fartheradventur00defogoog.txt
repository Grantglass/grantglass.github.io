This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

We fat ^ttt the ;th of FAruarj from Ir^lmU 
ftnd had a very fajr Gale of Wind for fome Daysi 
as I remember^ it might be about the 20th of Febmr 
ary in the Evening late, when the Mate having the 
Watch, came into the Round-houfe^ and told us^ 
he faw a Fla(h of Fire> and heard a Gun fixd^ 
and while he was telling us of it, a Boy came in^ 
and told us the Boatfwam heard another. This 
made us all run out upon the Quarter-peck> 
where for. a while we heard nothing, but in a few 
Minutes we faw a very great Light, and found 
that there v^s fome very terrible' Fire at a-Di- 
fiance i immediately we had Recourfe to our Rec- 
konings, in which we all agreed, that there could 
benol-andthat Way, in which the Fire fhew'd 
it felf, no not for 500 Leagues, for it appear^ at 
W. N. W.-Upon this we concluded it muft be 
fome Ship on Fire at Sea; and as by our hearing 
theNoife of Guns juft before, we concluded it 
could not be far off: We ftood direftly towards it, 
and were prcfently fati«fyM we flhould difcover it, 
becaufe the farther we fail'd, the greater the Light 
appeared tho' the Weather being haizy, we could •^ 
not perceive any Thing but the Light for a while ; 
in about half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being 
jfairfor us, tho' not much of it, and the Weathef 
clearing dp a little, we could plainly difcem that 
it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the 
Sea.

mdrc deplorable the Circumftanccs of the poof 
Cieatures beton^fng to this Ship mufh be, if they 
had no other Ship in Company with them : Upon 
this I immediately orderM, that five Guns fbould 
be«£r'd, one (bon after another, that, if poi&ble^ 
we might give Notice to them, that there was 
Hdp for them at hand, and that they might en- 
deavour to (ave themfelves in their Boat; Tortho^ 
we could fee the flame of the Ship, yet they, it 
being Night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by fome Time upon this, only driving 
09- the Burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-. 
Light, when on a fudden, to our great Terror, 
tho' we had Rcafon to expeft it, the Ship blew 
ufun the Air ; and immediately, that is to fay, 
ifLgk few MiDutesi ail the Fire was out, that is to 
fay, thc.reft of the Ship funk : This was a terrible, 
and indeed an abiding Sight, for the Sake of the 
pQpr Men, whoJ concluded muft be either all 
deftcoy'd in the Ship, ©r be in the utmoft Di-^ 
ftrejfs in their Boat in the. Middle of the Ocean,

Laoihacos for, and Jkepc firing Guns all the Night

We immediately fpread our Antient to let them 
know wefaw them, and hung a Waft out as a 
Signal for them to come on Board, and then made 
more Sail , {landing direftly to them. In little 
more than half an Hour we came up with them , 
and in a Word took them all in, being no Jefs than 
fixty four, Men, Women, and Children, for there 
were a great many Paflengers, 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French Mer- 
diant-Ship of 300 Ton, homeward bound from 
(hiebecky in the River of Canada. The Mafter 
gave i:^ a long Account of the Diftrefs of his Ship, 
how the* Fire began in the Steerage by the Negli- 
gence of the Steerfman, but on his crying out for 
Help, was, as every body thought, entirely put 
oVit, when they found that fome Sparks of the firft 
Fire had gotten into fome Part of the Ship, fo dif- 
ficult to come at, that they could not effeftually 
qiiencb i^, till getting in between the Timbers, 
and within the Ceiling of the Ship , it proceeded 
into the Hold , and mafter'd all the Skill, and all 
the Application they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into 
their Boats, which to their great Comfort were 
pretty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great 
Shalloup, befides a fmall Skiff which was of no 
great Service to them, other than to get fome 
frefh Water and Provifions into her, after they had 
fecur'd their Lives from tlie Fire. They had in- 
deed fmali Hope of their Lives by getting into 
thete Boats at that Diftance from any Land, only, 
as they faid well, that they were efcap'd from the 
Fire, and had a Poflibility that fome Ship might 
happen to be ac Sea , and might tak6 them in.

They had Sails, Oars, and a Compafs, and wer^ 
preparing to make the beft of their way back to 
JSfew'found Land , the Wind blowing pretty fair, 
for it blew an eafie Gale at S. E. by E. They had 
as much Provifions and Water, as with fparing 
it fo as to be next door to ftarving, might (upporc 
them about Twelve Days, in which, if they had 
no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, the 
Captain faid, he hop*d he might get the Banks of 
New-found Landy and might perhaps takcfonue Fifli 
to fuftain them ^till they might go on Shore. But 
there were fo many Chances againft them in all 
thefe Cafes ; fuch as, Sf orms to overfet and foun* 
der them. Rains and Cold to benumb and perifli 
their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep them out 
and ftarve them, that it muft have been next to 
miraculous if they had cfcap'd. 

In the midfi of their Confultations, every one 
being hopelefs and ready to defpair, the Captain 
with Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a 
fudden furpriz'd with the Joy of hearing a Guil 
fire, and after that four more, thefe were the five 
Guns which I caufed to be fired at firft feeing the 
Lig;ht : This revivM their Hearts, and gave them 
the Notice, which, aa above^ I defirM it ^lould^ 
(viz..) that there was a Ship at hand for their 
Help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe Guns, that they 
took down their Mafts and Sails, the Sound com** 
ing from the Windward they refolv'd to lye by 'till 
Morning. Some Time after this, hearing no mor« 
Guns, they fired three Muskets, one a confide- 
rable While after another, but thefe, the Wind 
being contrary, we never heard.

Some Time afterthat again they were ftiU more 
agreeably furpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and 
hearing the Guns, which, as I have faid, I caus'd 
to be fir^d all the refl of the Night ; this fee them 
to work with their Oars to keep their Boats a- 
head, at Icaft, that we might the fooner come up 
with them ; and at laft to their inexpreifible Joy, 
they found we faw them. 

It is impoffible for me to exprcfs the feveral 
Geftures, the fltange Extafies, the Variety of 
Pofturcs which thefc poor deliver^dPeople run into 
to exprefs the Joy of their Souls at (o unexpeded 
a Deliverance ; Grief and Fear are eafily defcri- 
bed; Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very tew Mo- 
tions ot the Head and Hands make up the Sum 
of its Variety : But an Excefs of Joy, a Surprize 
of Joy has a Thoufand Extravagancies in it; 
there were fome in Tears, fome raging, and tear- 
ing themfelves, as if they had been in the great- 
eft Agonies of Sorrow, fome ftark-raving and 
down-right lunatick, fome ran about the Ship 
ftamping with their Feet, others wringing their 
Hands ; fome were dancing, fome finging, fome 
laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not able 
to {peak a Word ; others fick and vomiting, feveral 
fwooning, apd ready to faint ; and a few were 
Croffing themfelves, and giving God Thanks. 

^p I would not wrong them neither, there might 
be many tKac were thankful afterward, but the 
Paflion was too flrong for them at firil, and they 
were not able to mafter it, they were thrown into 
Extafies and a Kind of Frenzy, and it was but a 
very few that were composM and ferious in their 
Joy.

Perhaps the Cafe may have fome Addition to it 
from the particular Circumftance of that Nation 
they belonged to, I mean the French^ whofe Tem- 
per is allow'd to be more volatile, more paffio- 
natc, and more fprightly, and their Spirits more 
fluid than in other Nations. I am not Philofopher 
enough to determine the Caufe, but nothing I 
had ever feen before came up to it : The Ex- 
tafies poor Friday^ my trufty Savage^ was in when 
he found his Father in the Boat, ca'me thenearefl: 
to it, and the Surprise of the Mafter and his two 
Companions, who I delivered from the Villains 
that fet them on Shore in the Ifland, came a little 
Way towards it, but nothing was to compare to 
this, either thati faw in Friday^ or any where elfc 
in my Life. 

It is further obfervable, that thefe Extravagan- 
cies didnotfliewthcmfelves in that different Man- 
ner I have mentioned in diflferent Perfons only : 
But all the Variety would appear in afliortSuc- 
ceflion of Moments in one and the fame Perfon. 
A Man that we faw this Minute dumb, and as it 
were ftupid and confounded, (hould the next Mi-

the only Man in the Ship that believ'd he was not

he fpoke, grew better, and quite well ; after the

pcirfedly well, took a Dram of Cordial which the

The younger Prieft bchav'd with great Com- 
mand of his ralfions, and was really an Examplp 
of a fcrious well-f^overn'd-Mindi at his firft com- 
ing on board the Ship, he threw himfelf flat on his 
Face, proftrating himfelf in Thankfulnefs for his 
Deliverance, in which I unhappily and uhfeafonr 
ably difturb'd him, really thinking he had been , 
in a . Swoon ; but, he fpake calmly, thank'd me, 
told me he was giving God Thanks for his De- 
liverance, and begg a me to leave hinx a few 
"Moments, and that next t,o his ^aker he would 
give me Thanks alfo. 

I was heartily forry that I difturb'd him, and 
not only left bira, but kept others from interrupt- 
ing him alfo ; he continued in that Poilure about 
three Minutes, or little more, after X left him, 
then came to me, as he had faid he would, an4 
with a great deal of Serioufnefs and Affeftion, but 
with Tears in his Eyes, thanked me that had, un- 
der God, given him and fo many miferable Crea- 
tures their Lives : I told him, I had no Room to 
move him to thank God for it, rather than me, 
but I added, that it was nothing but what Rea- 
fon and Humanity didated to all Men, and that we 
had as much Reafon as he to give Thanks to God 
who had blefs'd us fo far as to make us the Inftru-, 
ments of his Mercy to fo many of his Creatures. 

After this the young Prieft apply 'd himfelf to his / 
Country-Folks ; laboured to, compofe them j per- 
fwaded, entreated, argued, reafon'd with them, 
and did his utmoft to keep them within the Exer- 
cife of their Reafon, and with fome he. had Sue-

I cannot help ^committing this to Writing, as 
perhaps it may be ufeful to thofe into whofe Hands 
It may fall, for the guiding themfelves in all the 
JExtravaganciesof their Paffions, for if an Excefs 
pf Joy can carry Men out to fuch a Length beyond 
the Reach of their Reafon, what will not the Ex- 
travagancies of Anger, Rage, and a provok'd Mind 
carry iis to ? and indeed here I faw Reafon for 
keeping an exceeding Watch over our Paffions -of 
<svery Kind, as well thofe of Joy and Satisfaiftion, 
^s thofe of Sorrow and Anger. 

We were fomething difordered by thefe Extra- 
vagancies among our new Gucfls for the firft Day, 
l)ut when they had been retired, Lodgings provi- 
ded for them as well as our Ship would allow, 
and they had flept heartily, as moft of them did, 
they were quite another fort of People the next 
Pay. 

Nothing of cood Manners or ciyil Acknowledg- 
ments for the Ki'ndnefs fliewn them was wanting ; 
the French^ 'tis known, are naturally apt enough tp 
exceed that way. The Captain and one of the 
Priefts came to pie the next Day, and defiring to 
fpexk with me and my Nephew, the Commander: 
began to coiifult with us what (hould be done 
with them, and firft they told us, that as we had 
faved their Lives, fo all we had was little enough 
for a Return to us for that Kindnefs received 
The Captain faid, they had faved fome Money an4 
fome Things of Value in their Boats, catch 'd ha- 
Jlily up out of the Flames, and if we would accept 
it they were ordered to make an Offer of it all to 
ps ; they only deQred to be f^t on Shore fome-

vrhcre in our way, where if poffiblc they might 
^et Paffage to France. 

My Nephew was for accepting their Money at 
firft Word, and to confider what to do with them 
afterwards ; but I over-rul'd him in that part, 
for 1 knew what it was to be fet on Shore in a 
ftrange Country ; and if the Portugal Captain that 
took me up at Sea had ferv'd me fo, and took all 
I had for my Deliverance, I muft have ftarv'd, or 
have been as much a Slave at the Brajils as I had 
been in Barbary ; the meer being fold to a Afc- 
hometan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguefe is not 
much a better Mafter than a Turky if not in fomc 
Cafes a much worfe. 

I therefore told the French Captain that we had 
taken thefn up in their Diftrefs, it was true ; but 
that it was our Duty to do fo as we were Fellow- 
Creatures, and as we would defire to be fo deli- 
vered if we were in the like or any other Extremity ; 
that we had done nothing for them but what we 
believed they would have done for us,if we had been 
in their Cafe, and they in ours ,• but that we took 
them up to fave them, not to plunder them; and 
it would be a moft barbarous thing to take that 
little from them which they had favcd out of the 
Fire, and then fet them on Shore and leave them ; 
that this would be firft to fave them from Death, 
and then kill them our felves ; fave them from 
drowning, and abandon them to ftarving ; and 
therefore I would not let the leaft thing be taken 
from them : As to fetting them on Shore, I told 
theni indeed that was an exceeding Difficulty to 
us, for that the Ship was bound to the Eafi-hdies^ 
^nd tho* we were driven out of our Courfc to the 
Wcftward a very gf eat way, and perhaps w*s di-

yet it was impoflible for us wilfuUy to change our 
Voyage on this particular Account, nor could 
my Nephew the Captain answer it to the Fraigh- 
tcrs, with whom he was under Cliarter-Party to 
pinrfue his Voyage by the way of Brajils, and aO 
I knew we could do for them, was to put our felves 
in the way of meeting with other Ships homeward 
bound from the JVefl^Indies^ and get them Paflage if 
poflible to England or France, 

The firfl: part of the Propolal was fo generous 
and'kind they could not but.be very thankful'for 
it, but they were in a very great ConfternatioUt 
cfpecially the Paflengers, at the Notion of being 
carried away to the Eafl Indies^ and they then en- 
treated me, that fec.'ng I was driven fo far to the 
Wcftward before I met with them, I wou'd at leaft 
keep on the fame Courfe to tlie, Banks of Nevj- 
found Landy where it wsis probable I might meet 
with fome Ship or Sloop that they might hire to 
tarry them back to Canada from whence they 
came* 

1 thought this was but a reafonable Requeft on 
their Part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it, 
for indeed I coiafider'd, that to carry this whole 
Company to the Eafi- Indies , would not only be 
an intoUerable Severity upon the poor People, but 
would be ruining our whole Voyage by devouring 
all our Provifions ; fo I thought it no Breach of 
Charter-Party, but what an unforefcen Accident 
made abfolately necefl'ary to us, and in which no 
one could fay we were to blame, for the Laws 
of God and Nature would have forbid that wc

fentcd that we would carry them to Nevj-found

not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the

The Wind continued frefli Eafterly, but the

for our Humanity to work upon, almoft.as deplo*

for the Canaries. 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they 
were almoft ftarvM for want of Provifionsi befides 
the Fatigues they had undergone j their Bread and 
Flefli was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left 
in the Ship, and had had none for eleven Days ; 
the only Relief they had, was, their Water was not 
all fpent, and they had about half a Barrel of 
Flower left ,• they had Sugar enough ; fome Sue- 
cads or Sweet-naeats they had at firft, but they 
were devoured, and they had feven Casks of Rum* 

There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid- 
Servant on Board, who were going Paflcngers, 
and thinking the Ship was ready to fail, unhappi- 
ly came on Board the Evening before the Hurri- 
cane began, and having no Provifions of their cwn 
left, they were in a more deplorable Condition than 
the reft, for the Seamen being reduced to fiJch an 
extreme Neceffity themfelves had no Compaffion, 
we may be fure, for the poor Paflengers, and 
they were indeed in a Condition that their Mife-^ 
ry is very hard to defcribe. 

I had, perhaps, not known this Part if my Cu- 
riofity had not led me, the Weather being fair and 
the Wind abated, to go on Board the Ship : The 
Second Mate who upon this Occafion com- 
manded the Ship, had been on Board our Ship, 
and he told me indeed tbey had three Paflengers 
in the great Cabbin, that they were in a deplo- 
rable Condition, nay, fays he, I believe they are 
dead for I have heard nothing of them for above 
two Days, and I was afraid to enquire after them,

that I would have viftualM them, tho' we had 
gone away to Vtrginiay or any Part of the Coaft 
of America, to have fupply*d our felves, but there 
was no Neceffity for that. 

But now they were in a new Danger ; for they 
were afraid of eating too much, even of that little

The Sight of thcfc Peoples Diftrefs was very 
moving to me, and brought to Mind what I had. 
a terrible Profpeft of at my firft coming on Shore 
in the Ifland, where I had neither the Icaft Mouth- 
ful of Food, or any Profped of procuring any> be- 
fides the hourly Apprehenfion I had of being 
made the Food of other Creatures: But. all the 
while the Mate was thus relating to me the mifer 
rable Condition of the Ship*s Company, I could 
not put out of ray Thought the Story he had told 
me of the three poor Creatures in the Great Cab- 
bin, (viz..) the Mother, her Son, and the Maid- 
fervant, who he had heard nothing of for two oi: 
three Days, and who he feem*d to confefs they 
had wholly negleded, their own Extremities be- 
ing fo great; by which I underftood, that they 
had really given them no Food at all, and that 
therefore they muft be perifh'd,and be aU lying dead 
perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabbin, 

As I therefore kept the Mate, who we thencal- 
led Captain, on board with his Mentorefreflithem,: 
fo I alfo forgot not the ftarving Crew that were 
left on board, but ordered my own Boat to go on 
board the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve 
Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or 
iive Pieces of Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charged 
the Men to caufe the Meat to be boil'd while they 
ftay'd, and to keep Guard in the Cook-Room, to. 
prevent the Men taking it to eat ra^y, or taking it 
out of the Pot before it was well boil'd, and then 
to give every Man but a very little at a Time; 
and by this Caution he prefer v'd the Men, who 
would otherwife ha' kill'd themfelves with 
that very Food that was given them, on Purpofc 
to iave their Lives.

At tlic fame Time, I brder'd the Mate to g» 
into the Great Cabbin, and fee what Condition 
the poor Paflengcrs were in, and if they were a- 
live, to comfort them, and give them what Re- 
fre&ment was proper, and the Surgeon gave him 
a large Pitcher with fome of the prepar'd Broth 
which he had given the Mate that was on boards 
and which he did not queilion would reitore them 
gradually. 

I was not fatisfyM with this, but as I faid a- 
bove, having a great Mind to fee the Scene of 
Mifery, which 1 knew the Ship it felf would pre- 
fent me with, in a more lively Manner than I could 
have it by Report,! took the Captain of the Ship, 
as we now call'd him, with me, add wtnt my 
felf a little after in their Boat. 

I fbund the poor Men on board almoft in a Tu-» 
mult to get the Viduals out of the Boyler before 
it was ready : But my Miate obferv'd his Order^ 
and kept a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door/ 
and the Man he plac'd there, after ufing all pof- 
fible Perfuafion to have Patience, kept them off 
by Force: However, he caufed fome Bisket 
Cakes to be dipped in thePot,and foften'd with the 
Liquor of the Meat, which they call Brewes, and 
gave them every one, one, to ftay their Stomachs, 
and told them it was for their own Safety that he 
was obliged to give them but a little at a Time : 
But it was all in vain ; and had I not come on 
board, and their own Commander and Officers 
w^ith me, and with good Words, and fome Threats 
alfo of giving them no more, I believe they would 
have broke into the Cook-Room by Force, and 
tore the Meat out of the Furnace : For Words

little for themfelves, it was but too true that they 
had at firft kept them very low, and at laft total- 
ly negleded them ; fo.that for fix or fevenDays# 
it might be faid, they had really had no Food at 
all, and for feveral Days before very little. The 
poor Mother, who as the Men reported, was a 
Woman of goodSenfe and good Breeding, had

However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd

^Kcather, rbo'atfirft the Winds had beeniOom-f 
jt^ary, I fl^all trouble no body wich the little Jn-^ 
cidcnts of Wiiid, Weather, Currents, &c. on the 
reft of our Voyage ; but fhortning my Story for 
the fake of what is to follow, fliall obfervc that I 
fcame to my old Habitation, t^e Ifland, on the 
loth oi April 169^ : It was with uofmall Difficul- 
ty that I found the Place ; for as I came to it, 
and went from it before, on the $outh and £aft 
Side of the Iflatid, as coming from the Bmfilsy fo 
now coming in between the Main ^d the Ifland, 
;^nd having no Chart for the Cpaft, ;ior any L^ndr 
Mark, I d^d not know it when I faw it, or know 
whether I faw it or no. 

We bpat about a great while, and went on Shot? 
on feveral Iflands in the Mouth of the great River 
Oronooquey but iione for my Purpoft. Only this I 
learned by py Coafling ibe Shore, that I was under 
one great Miftake before, viz.. that the Conti- 
ripnt which I thought I faw, from the Ifland 1 
liv*d in, was really no Continent, but a long Ifland^ 
or rather a Ridge of lilands, reaching from one to 
phe pth«r Side of the extended Mouth of that 
great River, and that the Savages who came tp 
my Ifland, were not properly thofe which' we call 
f^arMefSy but Iflandef s , and other Barbarians of 
the fame kind , who inhabited fbmething nearer 
fo our Side thafi the relL 

In (hort, I vifited feveral of thefe Iflanil to no 
Purpofe y (ome I found were inhabited, and fome 
Y^ere not. On one of them I found fome •§5a»i- 
ardsy and thought they had liv'd there, but fpeak- 
ing with tlTcm , found they had a Sloop lay in a 
fmall Creek hard by , and they came thither to

But at laft Coafting from one Ifland to another, 
fometimes with the Ship, fom^timcs with 
the French Mens Shallop, which we had found a 
convenient Boat, and therefore kept her with 
their very good Will > at length I came fair on 
the South 5ide of my Jfland, and J prefently knew 
the very Countenance of the Place ; fo I brought 
the Ship fat^ to an Anchor, broadlide with the lit-

I could fee no body, no not with a Perfpedive

hie the Place, for the Fellow was right, as I 
found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was 
five or fix Men altogether, ftood to look at the 
Ship, not knowing what to think of us. 

As foon as Fnday had told me he faw People, 
I caused the Ef^Ujh Antient to be fpread, and fir'd 
three Guns, to give them nocice we were Friends, 
and in about half a quarter of an Hour after, we 
perceived a Smoke rife from the Side of the Creek,

day with me, and hanging out a white Flag, or 
Flag of Truce, I went diredly on Shore, taking 
with me the young Fryer I mention'd, to whom 
J had told the whole Story of my living there,

faid, I knew very well, was he who's Life I had

of very handforac Thing?, as a well bred Spaniard 
always knows how, and then beckoning to the Pcr- 
fon that attended him, bi<d him go and call out his 
Comrades. He theti'ask'd me, if I would walk to 
my old Habitation, where he would give me Pof- 
feffion of my own Houfe again, and wherelfliould^ 
fee they had made but mean Improvements; fo I 
walked along with him; but alas I could no more

for they had p.anted fo many Trees, and placed

very far from finding any Fault with it; for I knew 
they were a Parcel of refraftory, ungovcm*d Vi^

C^ief. 

While I was faying this, came the Man whom 
he had fent backhand with him eleven Men more : 
In the Drefs they were in it was impoflible to guefs 
what Nation they were of: But he made all clear 
both to them and to me. Firft he tumM to me, and 
pointing to them, faid, Thefc, Sir, are fome the 
Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you; and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them 
know who I was ; upon which they all came up 
one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and 
ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, as ii 
they had been Ambafladprs of Noblemen, ^nd I 
a Monarch or a great Conqueror; their Behavi-^

but I fliall cdlic6t the Fa&s Hiftorically, as near a$ 
I can gather them out of my Memory from what 
they related to me, and from what I met with in 
my converfing with them and with the Place. 

In prder to dp thiiS fuccindly, and as intelligi- 
\f\y as I can, I mui| go back tp th^ Circumftanc? 
in which I left the Ifland, and in which the Per? 
fons were, of whom I am to (peak. An^ firft, it i? 
neceflary to repeat, that I had fcnt avyay Fridays 
Father and the Spaniard, the two whofc Lives I had 
^cfcued from the Savages, I fay, I had fcnt them 
away in a large Canoe to the Main, as I tbcu 
thought ft, to fetch over the Spaniard's Cqn^r 
panions who he had left behind him, in or^er to 
iave them frpm the like .Calamity that he had been 
in > and in brdpr'to fiiccour them for the prefent, 
ai.d that, if pofiible, we might together find fopa^ 
Way tor our Deliverance afterwaro. ^.^ 

When I fent them away, I had no yifibic Ap* 
pearance bf, ' or the leaft room to hope for my owij 
Deliverance any more than I had twenty Year bpt 
fore, much lefs had I any fore Knowledge of what 
afterward happened, I mean of an EngUJb Ship 
coming on Shore there to fetch me off; and it 
could nqt but be a very great ' Surprize to thenj 
when they came bacK, not only to find that I was 
gone, but to find three Stranccjrs left on the ^^ox^ 
poirefi>*d of all that I'hadleft behind me, whicl] 
would btherWifc have been their own.

riety in that Part , for nothing remarkable hap- 
pened to them on the Way, they having very calm 
Weather, and a fmooth Sea ; for his Countrymen 
It eould not be doubted, he faid, but that the/ 
were overjoyed to fee him: (It feems he was the 
principal Man among them, the Captain of the 
Vcfl'el they had been fhipwreck'd in, having been 
dead fpme Time) they wcrCy he faid, the more 
furpriz'd to fee him, becaufe they knew that he 
was fallen into the Hands of the Savages, who, 
they were fatisfy 'd, would devour him as they did 
all the reft of their Prifoners, that when he told 
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what 
Manner he was furnifh'd for carrying them away, 
it was like a Dream to them; and their Aftonifh- 
ment, they faid, was fbmewhat like thatofj^o- 
fephi's Brethren, when he told them who he was^ 
and told fjjem the Story of his Exaltation in Pha^ 
raoh's Court : But when hrfliew'd them the Arms, 
the Powder, the Ball, and the Provifions that he 
brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they 
were reftor'd to themfelves, took a juft Share of 
the Joy of their Deliverance, and immediately pre- 
pared to come away with him. 

Their firft Bufinefs was to get Canoes, and in 
this they were oblig'^d not to ftick Co much upon 
the honeft Part of it, but to trefpafs upon their 
friendly Savages, and to borrow two large Canoes 
or Periagilas, on Pretence of going out a fifhing, 
or for Pleafurc.

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in 
that Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occa- 
fion offered for my Efcapc, as I mentioned in my 
bther Part, and to get off from the Ifland, 
leaving three of the moft impudent, hardened, 
ungovern'd, difagreeable Villains behind me, 
that any Man could defirc to meet with, to the 
poor Spaniards great Grief and Difappointment, 
you may b* fure. 

The ohly juft Thing the Rogues did, • was^ 
That when the Spaniards came on Shore, they 
gave my Letter to them, and gave them Provi- 
lions and other Relief, as i had orderM them to 
ido, alfo they gave them the long Paper of Di- 
reftions which I had left with them, containing 
the particular Methods which I took for manag- 
ing every Part of my Life there, the Way how I 
baked my Bread, bred up tairi^ Goats, and plant- 
ed my Corn, how I cur^d my Grapes, made my 
Pots, and, in a Word, every Thing I did, all 
this being written down, they gave to the Spa- 
niards, two of whom underftand Engltjh well 
enough ; nor did they refufe to accommodate the

greed very well for fome Time ; They gave thern

their Suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfyM with 
this, would the ochcr but have let them alooe, 
which, however, they could not find in their 
Hearts to do long ; but, like the Dog in the Man^ 
ger, they would not eat themfelves, and would 
not let others eat neither ; The Differences ne- 
verthelefs, were at firft but trivial, and fuch as 
are not worth relating ; but at laft, it broke out

Reafon, without Provocation, contrary to Na-*

is true the firft Relation of it came from the ^^ 
niards themfelves, who I may call the Accu(crs# 
yet when I came to examine the Fellows, they 
could not deny a Word of it. 

But before I come to the Particular of this 
Part, I muft fupply a Dcfeft in my former Rela- 
tion, and this was, that I forgot to fet down str 
mong the reft, that juft as we were weighing the. 
Anchor to fet Sail, there happened a little Quar- 
rel on board our Ship, which I was afraid once 
would have tumM to a fecond Mutiny ; nor was 
it appeas'd, ^ill the Captain rouzing up his Cou-

them by Force, and making two of the moft re-* 
fradory Fellows Prifoners, he laid them in Irons^ 
and as they had been aftive in the former Difor-

Word to them, they appeared eafy^ and the more

Bat to come to the Family P^k^ being all now 
good Friends, for common Dangcr^j as f fiiid^7 
bove, hadeflfe^ually reconciled them, tjhey began 
to confider their general Circuti^ilances ; and the 
£rft Thing tfa^at came under their Confideration 
was. Whether, feeing the Savages particularly 
flaunted that Side of the Ifland, and that there 
were" more remote and retired Parts of it equally 
adapted to their Way of Living, and manifeftly 
to their Advantage, they (hould not rather remove 
ttheir Habitation, and plant in foilie more prope? 
Place for their Security, and efpeciaUy (<x: the Se- 
curity oftheii: Cattle and Corn? 

Upon this, after long Debate, it wa? conclud- 
ed. That they would not remove their Habitati- 
on; becaufe, that fome Time or other, they 
thought. they might hear from their Governour 
-again, meaning me; and if I (hould fend any one 
to feek them, I fliould be fure to direft them to that 
Side, where, if they fliould find the Place demo- 
lifli'd, they would conclude the Savages had kill'd 
«s all, and we were gone, and fo our Supply 
would go to. 

But as to their Cora and Cattle, they agreed tp 
jremove thqm into the Valley where my Cave wai, 
where the Laind was as proper for both, and 
where indeed there was Land enough : However, 
upon fecond Thought, they alter'd one Part of 
that Refolution too, and refolv'd only to remove 
Part of their Cattle thither, and plant Part of 
their Corn there ; and fo if one Part was de-. 
ftroy'd, the other might be fav'd: And one Part 
of Prudence they ufed, which it was very well 
they didiviz.. That they never trufted thofe three 
Savages, which they had Prifoners, with knowing

pny Thing pf the Plantation they had mad,e in that 
Valley, or of any Cattle they had there \ much 
}efs of the Cave there, which they kept in Cafe 
pf Neceflity, as a fafe Retreat, and whither they 
f arry'd alfo the two Barrels of Ppwder, whiph I 
^ad (cat them at my coming avv^y. 

But however, they refolv'd not to change their 
Habitation, yet they agreed, that as I had care- 
fully covered it firft with a VVall or Fortification, 
and then with a Grove of Trees; fo (eing their 
Safety confiftcd entirely in their being conccalM ; 
pf which they were npw fully convinced, they fet 
to Work to cover and conceal the Place, yet more 
effeftually than before ; to this Purpofe, as I had 
planted Trees, or rather thruft in Stakes, which in 
Time all grew up to be Trees for fome good Di- 
ftance before the Entrance into my Apartment; they 
went on in the fame Manner, and fiUM up the reft of 
that whole Space of Ground from the Trees I had 
fet, quite down to the Side of the Creek ; where,as 1 
faid, I landed my Floats, and even into the very 
Ouze where the Tide flow'd, notfo much as 
leaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there 
had been any landing thereabout ; thefe Stakes al- 
fo being of a Wood very forward to grow, as I 
have noted formerly, they took Care to have ge- 
nerally very much larger and taller than thofc 
which I had planted ; and as they grew apace, fo 
they planted them fo very thick andclofe together, 
that when they had been three or four Years 
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any 
confiderable Way into the Plantation : And as for 
that Part which I had planted, the Trees were 
grown as thick as a Man's Thigh ; and among 
them they placed fo many other fliort ones, arid 
fo thick, that, in a Word, it flood like a Pallifa-

^o a quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next t© 
Impoffible to penetrate it, but with a little Army 
to cut it all down ; for a little Dog could hardly 
get between the Trees, they ftpod (o q\ok. 

But this was not all ; for they did the fame by 
Jill the Gfround to the Right-hand, and to the 
Left, and round even to the Top of the HiU, 
leaving no Way, not fo much as fpr tl^emfelves to 
pome out, but by the gadder placed up to the 
3ide of the HiU, and then lifted up and placed 
again, from the firft Stage up to the Topi which 
Ladder when it was taken down nothing but what; 
had Wings or W^^chcraft to ^flift it, coulc} come; 
at them, 

This was excellently well contrived; nor was it; 
lefsthan what they afterwards found Occafion for» 
which ferv'd to convince me, that as human Pru- 
dence has theAuthority of Prpvidence to|aftify it,fQ 
it has doi\bt!efs the Direftion of Providence to fet: 
it to Work ; and would we Ixften carefully to th? 
Voice of it, I am fully pcrfuaded we might pre-x

pow, by our own ^^gligcnce, fubjefted to ; But 
this by th? Way. 

I return to the Storyi They livM ?wo Ycar^ 
after this in perfeft Retirement, and had np mor^ 
Vifits from the Savages : They had indeed ai^ 
Xlarna given thtrni one Morning, which put: 
them into a great, Gouft^rnation j fof fome pf the; 
Spaniards being out early one Morning on the Weft

' They made the bcft of their Way Home it\ 
JIurry enough, and giving the Alarm to their 
Comrades, they kept clofe all that Day; and 
the next, going out only at Night to make Obfer- 
yation : But they had the good Luck to be miftaken jf 
for where-ever the Savages went, they did not 
land that Time on the Ifl^nd, but purfued fome 
pther Defign, 

And now they had another Broil with the thrcq 
^nglijh Men ; cxie of which, a moft turbulent Fel- 
low, being in a Rage at one of the three Slaves^^ 
which I mentioned they had taken, becaufe the 
Fellow had not done fome Thing right which 
he bid him do, and feem'd a little untraftable ia 
his fliowing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog- 
Pelt in which he wore it by his Side, and fell up- 
on the poor Savage, not to corred him, but to 
^ill him. One of the Spaniardsy who was by, fee- 
ing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut with the 
Hatchet, which he aim*d at his Head, but ftruck 
into his Shoulders fothat he thought he had cut 
the poor Creature's Arm offi run to him, and 
entreating him not to murther the poor ^Man, 
clapt in between him and the Savajge, to prevent 
the Mifchief. 

The Fellow being enrag*d th? nipre at thls^ 
ftruck at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, ana 
fwore he would ferve him as he intended to ferve 
the Savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoi- 
ded th(^ Blow; and with a Shovplwhich he had 
in his Hand, for they were all working in the 
Field about their Corn-Land, knock'd the Brute

in to help their Man, and a third EngUJh Man f?ij 
in upon them : They had none of them any Fire 
Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchets and 
other Tools, except this thixd Ejtglijh Man, he haa 
pnc of my, old rufty Cutlafhes, with which he 
jnade at the two laft Sfaniardsy and wounded theni 
both ; This Fray fet the whple Family ^n an Up-j 
roar, and more Help coming in, they took the 
three Englifh Men Prisoners. The next Qupflioil 
was. What fliouJd be done with then^, they had 
been fo often mutinous, and were fo furious, fq 
defperate, and fo idle wathal, that they knew 
not what Cpurfe to take with them ; tor they 
were mifchievpus to the higheft Degree, and va- 
lued not what Hurt they did to any Man; fq 
that, in fhprt^ it was not fafe to livf with them. 

The Spaniard^ who was Governour, told then^ 
in fo many Words, That if they had been of his 
Qwn Country, he would have hang'd them i for 
^1 Laws and all Governours was to preferve Sq- 
ciety y and thofe who were dangerous to the So-

Prefervation and Deliverance, he would ufe them 
with all ppflible Lenity, and would leave them to 
the Judgment of the other two EngUJh Men, whq.

When the Sfanijh Gov^rnour heard this, he 
palls to JViIUam Atkim, How Seignior Atkins, fay^ 
he, MTould you murther us all? What have you to 
fay to th*t ? That hardened Villain was fo far 
from denying it, that he faid it was true, and 
G— d d— m him they would do it ftiU before they 
had done with them- Well, but Seignior Atkins,

by killing us? And what muft we do to pre- 
vent you killing us ? MmA we kill you, or you will 
kill us? Why will you put us to the Neceffity 
of this. Seignior Atkins, fays the Spaniard very 
calmly and fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the S//j- 
piard's making a Jeft of it, that had he not been 
held by three Men, and withal had no Weapons 
near kirn, it was thought he would have attemp- 
ted to have killed the Spaniard in the Middle of 
all the Company. 

Jhis hair-brain*d Carriage oblig'd them to con- 
fider fcripufly what wa? to be done ; the two 
^nglijh Men and the Spaniard who fav'd the poor 
Savage was of the Opinion, they fliould hang one 
of the three for an Example to the reft, and that 
particularly, it fhoutd be he that had twice at- 
tempted to commit Murther with his Hatchet, 
and indeed there was fome Reafon to believe he 
had done ir, for the poor Savage was in fuch a mi-^

Manner they did; that they were not handy e-

be ftarv'd: But if the Spaniards would give them 
Leave to take one of the Canoes which they came 
over in, and give them Arms and Ammunition, 
proportioned for their Defence, they would go 
over to the Main, and feek their Fortune, and fo 
deliver them from the Trouble of fupplying them 
with any other Provifions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them, but yet very honeftly rcprclcnted rd 
them the certain Deftru^bion they were run-?

Hardlhips upon rhat very Spot, that they could 
without any Spirit of Prophcfy tell thcirx, that

The Spaniards told them, with great Kind^

(hould not go like naked Men, and be in no\ 
Condition to defend themfelves ; and that tho': 
they could ill fpare their Fire-Arms, having' 
not enough for themfelves, yet they would let 
them have two Muskets, a Piftdl, and a Got- 
Izfhf and each Man a Hatchet, which they 
thought was fufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the Offer, and ha* 
ving baked them Breao enough to ferve them

cannot tell who ? They arc the Sarages to be furc. 
No, no, fajrs the Ei^lift^ Man, they are Men in

Why ^e you concern^ ? If they are not Savages 
they muft be Friends, for there is no Chriftian Na- 
tion upon Earth but will do ui good rather than 
harm. 

While they were debating thus, comes the 
three Englijh Men, and ftanding without the 
Woodj which was new planted, halloed to them :

that the Land they faw From our Ifland was not

defiroas to fee thofe Prifoners, but the other mi- 
flaking them, thought they were defirous to have 
fome of them to carry away for their own eating. 
So they beckoned to them, pointing to the fetting 
of the Sun, and then to the rifing, which was to 
fignify> that the next Morning at Sun rifing they 
would bring fome for them, and accordingly the 
next Morning they brought down five Women 
and eleven Men, and gave them to the Englifi Men, 
to carry with them on their Voyage, juft as wc 
would bring fo many Cows and Oxen down to a 
Sea-Port Town, to visual a Ship. 

As brutifh and barbarous as thefe Fellows were 
at Home, their Stomachs turned at this Sight, and 
they did not know what to do ; to refufe the Pri- 
foners, would have been the higheft Affront to 
the Savage Gentry that offer'd them ; and what to 
do with them they knew not ; however upon fome 
Pdbates they refolv'd to accept of them, and in re-

of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and fix 
or feven of their Bullets, which tho' they did not 
underftand, they feem'd extremely pleased with : 
And then tying the poor Creatures Hands behind 
them, they (the People) dragged the poor Prifo- 
ners into the Boat for our Men.

Boat and came back towards the firil Ifland, where, 
when they arrived, they fet eight of their Prifo- 
ners at Liberty, there being too many of them for 
their Occafion, 

In thejr Voyage they endeavoured to have fomc 
Communication with their Prifoners, but it was 
impoinble to make them underftand any thing; 
nothing they could fay to them, or give them, or 
do for them, but was look'd upon as going about 
to murder them. They firft of all unbound them, 
but the poor Creatures skream'd at that, efpecially 
the Women, as if they had juft felt the Knife at 
their Throats ; for they immediately concluded 
they were unbound on purpofe to be kilfd. 

If they gave them any thing to eat it was the 
fame thing ; they then concluded it was for fear 
they fliould fink in Flefli, and fo not be fat enough 
to kill. If they looked at one of them more parti- 
cularly, the Party prefently concluded, it was to

Nay, after they had brought them quite* over,

The firft Thing they did, was to caufe the old

this I think is but juft, for avoiding Diforders 
and Quarrels among you, and I defire it of you,

But the Wonder of this Story was, how .five 
fuch refraftory ill matched Fellows fhould agree 
about thefe Women, and that tw6 of them flioul4 
not pitch upon the fame Woman, efpecially fee- 
ing two or three of them were without Compari- 
fon, more agreeable than the other: But they 
took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling 
among themfelves ; for they fct the five Womea 
by themfelves in one of their Huts, and they 
V^ent all into the other Hut, and drew Lots a-^ 
mong them, who (hould chufe firft. 

He that drew to chufe firft, went away by him- 
felf to the Hutc where the poor naked Creatures 
were, and fetched out her he chofc ; and it was 
worth obferVihg, that he that chofe firft took her 
that was reckoned the homelieft, and the oldeft of 
the five, which made Mirth enough among the reft i

low confider'd better than any of them, that it 
was Application iand Bufinefs that they were to 
expeft Afliftance in, as much as iany Thing elfe ; 
and flie prov'd the bcft Wife of all the Parcel. 

When the poor Women faw themfelves fet 
in a Row thus, and fetched out one by one, the 
Terrors of their Condition returned upon them 
again, and they firmly believed that they were 
now a going to be devoured,- accordingly, when 
the Englijh Sailor came in and fetched out one of

it poffibk for the Engl{/b Men to fatisfy thenu 
that they were not to be immediately murthcr'd, 
'till they fetched the old Man, Friday's Father, 
yrho immediately let them know that the 
. ifive Men, who had fetched them out, one by one, 
had chofcn them for their Wives. 

Whp they had done, and the Fright the Women 
were in was a little over, the Men went to Work, 
and the Spaniards came and helped them^ and in 
a few Hours they had built them every one a new 
Hut otTent for their Lodging apart; forthofe

ordering their Vines, their Grapes were as good 
again, as any of the others. They had alfo 
found themfelves out a Retreat in the thickeft 
Part of the Woods, where, tho' there was not a

zs I faid, grew fo eafily, made the Wood unpafla-

to get over the out-fide Part, and then went on 
^^y Ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three Reprobates, as I juftly call 
them, tho'they were much civiliz'd by their new 
Settlement, compar'd to what they were before, 
and were not fo quarrelfome, having not the 
fame Opportunity ; yet one of the certain Com- 
panions of a profligate Mind never left them, 
and that was their Idlenefs ; it is true, they plan- 
ted Corn, and made Fences ; but Solomons Words 
were never better verified than in them, I went by 
ihe VineyaYd of the Slothful^ and itwoA all over-grown 
ivith 7%oms ; for when the Spaniards came to view 
their Crop, they could not fee it in fome Places 
for Weeds ; the Hedge had feveral Gaps in it, 
where the wild Goats had got in, and eaten up 
the Corn ; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bufli 
was cram'd in, to ftop them out for the prefent, 
but it was only Ihutting the Stable-door after the 
Steed was ftolen ; whereas, when they look'd on 
the Colony of the other two, there was the very 
Face of Induftry and Succefs upon all they did ; 
there was not a Weed to be feen in all their 
Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges ; and they 
on the other Hand verified Solomons Words iii ano- 
ther Place, I'hat the diligent Hand makes r^h, for e- 
veryThing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty

had a fair Opportunity to do; for one of the tw9 
Mnglijb Men, in whofe Quarter it was where the 
Fi^t began, led them round between the Woods, 
and the Sea Side Weftward, and then tumingfhorc 
South, they came fo near where the thickell 
of them lay, th^t before they were feen or heard, 
eight of them fir'd in among thcm^ and did dread- 
ful Execution upon them; in half a Minute more,

their Swords, arm'd Staves^ and Hatchets, and 
laid about them fo well, that, in a word, they 
fct up a difmal Skreaming and Howling, flying to 
fave their Lives, whicH Way foever they could. 

Our Men were tyr'd with the Execution ; and 
killed or mortally wounded, in the two Fights,, 
about 1 80 of them; the reft, being frighted 
Qut of their Wits, fcour'd thro* the Woods, and 
over the Hills, with all the Speed, Fear, and nim- 
ble Feet could help them to do ; and as we did 
not trouble our feives much to purfue them, they 
got all together to the Sea Side where they landed, 
and where their Canoes lay : But their Difafter 
was not at an End yet ; for it blew a terrible Storm 
of Wind, that Evening, from the Sea-ward; fo that 
it was impoflible for them to go off; nay, the 
Storm continuing all Night, when the Tide came 
up, their Canoes were moft of them driven by 
the Surge of the Sea, fo high upon the Shore, 
that it required infinite Toil to get them off; and 
fome of them were even dafli'd to Pieces againft 
the Beach, or againft one another* 

Our Men, tho' glad of their Viftory, yet got 
little Reft that Night ; but having refrefli'd them-

neceflarfly led them over the Place where the 
Fight had been, and where they found ieveral of

However, there was no Need td give any Or- 
ders in this Cafe ; for their own Savages, who 
were their Servants, difpatch'd thofe poor Crea- 
tures with their Hatchets* 

At lengths they came in view of the Place, 
where the more miferable Remains of the Savages 
Army lay, where there appeared about an hundred 
ftiil ; their Pofture was generally fitting upon the 
Ground, with their Knees ijp towards their Mouthy 
and the Head put between the two Hands, lea- 
ning down upon the Knees. 

When our Men came within two Musket-flbot 
of them, the Spaniard Governour ordered two 
Muskets to be firM without Ball, to alarm them ; 
this he did, that by their Countenance he might 
know what to expeft, (i;/Jt.) whether they were 
iliil in Heart to fight, or were fo heartily beaten, 
as to be difpirited and difcouragM, and fo he 
might manage accordingly. 

This Stratagem took ; forasfoon as the Sava- 
ges heard the firft Gun, and faw the Flafli of the 
fecond, thcyfiarted up upon their Feet, in the- 
greateft Conftemation imaginable j and as our 
Men advanced fwiftly towards them, they all run 
skreaming and yawling away, with a kind of a 
howling Noife, which our Men did not under'- 
ftand, and bad never heard before; and thus they 
run up the Hills into the Country* 

At firft, our Men had mueh rather the Weather 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to

ftanding his Wound, kept always with tbem» 
prbv'd the befl CounfeiJour in this Cafe : His 
Advice was to take the Advantage that offer'd^ 
and clap in between the:m and their Boats, and fo 
deprive them of the Capacity of ever returning a- 
ny more to plague die Ifland. 

They confulted long about this, ahd fome 
were againft it, for fear of making the Wretches 
fly to the Woods, and live there defperate, and 
fo they ftiould have them to hunt like wild Beafts, 
.be afraid to ftir out about their Bufinefs, and have 
tlieir Plantations continuall rifile^d, all their tame 
Goats deftroy*d, and in fhbrt, be redue'd to a 
Life of continual Diftrefs, 

lirtU, Atkins told them. They had betti^r have 
t© do with a hundred Men, than with a.hundred 
Nations ; that as they muft deftroy their BoatSji 
fo they muft deftroy the Men, or be all of them 
dcftroy'd rhemfelves : In a word> he fliew^d them 
the Neceffity of it, fo plainly, that they aU 
tame in to it; fo they went to Work immediate- 
ly with the Boats ; and getting fome dry Wood 
together, from a dead Tree, they try'd to ku 
fome of them on Fire; but they were fo wet, that 
they would not burn ; however, the Fire fo burn'd 
Xhe upper Part, that it foon made them unfit (ot 
fwiming in the Sea as Boats. When the Indians 
faw what they were about, fortie of them came 
running out of the Woodsj and coming as hear as 
they could to our Men, kneel'd down, and cry'd,^

dcrftood any thing of; but as they made piti-

undcrftand, they be^g*d to have their Eioats 
fpar'd^ and that chey would be gone, and never 
come their agaim 

But our Men were now fatisfied, that they 
had no Way to prcferve themfelves, or to fave 
their Colony, but cfFcftually to prevent any of 
thefe People from ever going Home again v de- 
pending upon this, that if ever fo much as one 
of them got back into their Country to tell the 
Story, the Colony was undone •, fo that letting 
them know, that they (hould not have any 
Mercy, they fell to work wich their Canoes, 
and deftroy'd them every one, that the Storm 
had not deftroy'd before ,• at the Sight of which, 
the Savages rais'd a hideous Cry in the Woods, 
which our People heard plain enough; after 
which, they ran about the Ifland like diftraft- 
cd Men, fo that in a word, our Men did not 
.really know at firft what te d(d with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards^ with all their Pru- 
dence^ confider, that while they made thofe 
People thus Defperate, they ought to have 
kept good Guard at the fame time upon their 
Plantations ; for tho' it is true, they had driven 
away their Cattle, and thcJndians did not find 
out their main Rctrcar, I mean my old Caftle 
at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Valley, ytt 
they found out. my Plantation at the Bower, 
and pulPd it all to pieces, and all the Fences and 
.Pianring about it; trod all the Corn under- 
foot-, tore up the Vines and Grapes^ being )uft 
then almoft ripe, and did to our Men an ine-

Tho' our Men were able to fight them upoa 
all Occafions, yet they were in no Condition 
to purfue them^ or hunt them up and down ; 
for as they were too nimble of Foot for our 
Men, when they found thwi fingle, fo our 
Mea durft not go about finglc, for fear of be- 
ing furrounded with their Numbers. The beft 
was, they had no Weapons, for tho* they had 
Bows they.had no Arrows left, nor any Mate- 
rials to make any, nor had they ^ny edg'd Tool 
or Weapon among them. 

The Extreraety and Diftrefs they were re- 
duced ro was great, and indeed deplorable; 
but at the fame time, our Men were alfo 
brought to very bad Circumftances by thena; 
for tno' their Retreats were preferv'd, yet their 
Provifion was deftroy'd, and their Harveffc 
fpoird, and what to do, or which way to turn 
thcmfelves, they knew not: The only Refuge 
they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they 
had in the Valley by the Cave, and fome little 
Corn which grew there •, and the Pkntation of 
of the three EngUJh Men, WilLAtkbis and his 
Comrades, who were now reduced to two, one 
of them being kill'd by an Arrow which ftruck 
him on the side of his Head, juft under the 
Temple?, (o that he never fpoke more •, and it 
was very remarkable, that this was the fame 
barbarous Fellow who cut the poor Savage 
Slave with his Hatchet, and who afterwards 
intended to have mtjrcher*d all the Spaniards.

I looked upon thciV Cafe ta have been worfc 
at clifs time, than mine was at any time, after 
i firft difcovered the Grains of Batlj^ and 
Kice, apd got into the manner of planting and 
rafifing my Corn) add my tame Cattle ; for now 
they had, as I may fay, a hundred Wolves up^ 
on the Ifland. which would devour every 
Thing they could come at, yet could very hatd- 
]y be come at themfelvcs. 

The firft Thing they concluded, when they 
/aw what their Cira^mftaoces were, was, that 
they would, if poffible, drive them up to the 
farther Part of the Ifland, South-Weft, that if 
jiny more Saviges came on Shore, thiiy might 
not find one another. Then, that they would 
daily hunt and barrafsthem, and kill as many of 
them as thev could cofne at, till they had re- 
duced their Number ; and if they could at laft 
tame them, and bring them to any thing, they 
would give them Corn, aiid teach them how tq 
plant ^nd live upon their daily Lftbour. 

Ill ofder to this, they fo followed themi and Iq 
terrified them with their Guns, that in a few 
Days, if any of them fir'd a Gun at an Indian^ 
if he did not hit him, yet he wpuld fall -down 
for Fear ; and fo dreadfully frighted they werc» 
that they kept out of fight farther and farther, 
till atlaftour Men following them, and every 
Day almoft killing or wounding fomcof them, 
they kept up in the Woods and hollow Places 
fo much, that it reduced them to the utmoft 
Mifcry for want of Food, and many were af- 
terwards found dead In the Woods, wichoiit ar 
py hurt, but mecrly (i^tv'd to Death.

After this, the Colony cnjoy'd a perfe6fc 
Tranquilh'ty with refped to the Savages, till I 
came to rcvifit thero, which was above two 
Years : Not, but that now and then fome Canoes 
of Savages came on Shore for their triumphal un*^ 
natural Feafts, but as they were of feveral Nati- 
ons, and perhaps had never heard of thofe that 
came before, or the Reafon^ of it, they did not 
make any Search or Enquiry after their Coun«

very hard to have found them out.

and ^ they frequently went among them, but 
forbid on Pain of Death, any one of the bidiims

their Settlement bctray'd again. 

One Thing was very remarkable, (vit..) that 
they taught the Savages to make Wicker- workj 
or Baskets ; but they ioon outrdid their Matters; 
for they made abundance of moft ingenious 
Things in Wicker-work \ particularly, all forts

pretty often indeed put one another in Mind thit 
there was a God, by the very common Method 
of Seamen, (viz..) Swearing by his Name ; noc 
were their poor ignorant Savage-Wives much the 
better for having been married to Chriflians, as 
we mnft call them ; for ias they knew very little of 
God themfelves, fo they were utterly uncapable 
of entring into any Difcourfe with their Wives 
about a God> or to talk any thing to them 
concerning Religion. 

The utmoft of all the Improvement, which I 
can fay the Wives had made from them, was, 
that they had taught them to fpeak Englifi pret- 
ty well, and all the Children' they had, which 
was near 20 in all, were taught to fpeak Evglifi 
too, from their firft learning to fpeak, tho' they 
at firft, fpoke it in a very broken manner, like 
their Mothers. There were none of thefe Chil- 
dren above fix Year old when I came thither, for 
it was not much above feven Year that they had 
fetched thefe five Savage Ladies over> but they had 
all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Children, 
more or lefs^> I think the Cook's-mate's Wife, 
was big of her fixth Child ; and the Mothers 
were all a good fort of wcll-governM quiet la- 
borious Women, modeft and decent, helpful to 
one another,- mighty obfervant and fubjed.tp 
their Mafters, I cannot call chem Husbands; 
and wanted nothing but to be well inftru&ed in 
the Chriftian Religion, and to be legally marri- 
ed ; both which, were happily brought about 
afterwards by my Means, or at leaft, in Con- 
fequence of my coming among^ them.

JEi^tilb Men, t muft fay fomething oitht ^^miardsi 
who were the main Body of the Family ; and in 
whofe Story there arc fome Iiicidcnts alfo rcmar* 
kable enough, 

1 had a great many Difcourfes with them about 
their Circumftances when they were among the 
iSavages : They told me readily, that they had 
no Inftances to give of their Application or Inge^ 
nuity in that Country ; that they were a poor 
miferable dcjedcd Handful of People, that if 
Means had been put into their Hands, had yet 
fo abandoned themfeives to Defpair, and fo funk 
under the Weigl|t of their Misfortunes, that they 
thought of nothing but ftarving: One oflhem, 
a grave and very fenfible Man, told me, he was 
convinced, they were in the Wrong ; that it waS 
not the Part of wife Men to give up themfeives 
to their Mifery, but alv^ays to take hold of the 
Helps which Reafon oflfer'd, as well for prefent Sup- 
port, as for future Deliverance. He told me that 
Grief was the mod fenfelefs infignificant Paffion 
in the World ,• for that it regarded only Things 
paft, which were generally impoflible to be re- 
called, or to remedy'd, but had no View to Things 
to come, and had no Share in any Thing that 
iook'd like Deliverance, but rather added to the 
Affliction, than propofed a Remedy : And upon 
this he repeated a *S/^fl»f^ Proverb^ whicbtho'I 
cannot repeat in juft the fame Words that he fpoke 
it in, yet I remember I made it into an EngUJb 
Proverb of my own, thus : 

In Trouble to be troubrd^ 

Is to have your Trouble doubrd.

tic run on then in Remarks upon all tde little 
Improvements I had made in my Solitude ; my un- 
wearied Applxation, as he callM it, and how I 
had made a Condition, which in its Circumftan-* 
ces was at firft much worfe than their's a thoiH 
fand Times, more happy than their^s was, even 
now when they were all together. He told me, 
at was remarkable, that Englijb Men had a grea- 
ter Prefence of Mind, in their Diftrefs, than 'any 
People that ever he met with, that their unhappy 
Nation, and the Ponuguefe^ were the worft Men 
in the World to ftruggle with Misfortunes i for 
that their firft Step in Dangers, after the common 
Efforts were over, was always to defpair, lie down 
under it, and die, without roufing their Thoughts 
up to proper Remedies for Efcape. 

I told him, their Cafe and mine differ*d exceed- 
ingly, that they were caft upon the Shore without^ 
Keceffaries, without Supply of Food, or of pre- 
fent Suftenance, 'till they could provide : That it 
is true, I had this Difadvantage and Difcomfort, 
that I was alone ; but then the Supplies I had pro- 
videntially thrown into my Hands, by the uncx- 
pefted driving of the Ship on Shore, was fuch a 
Help as would have encouragM any Creature in 
the World to have apply'd himfelf as I had done. 
Seignior, (ays the Spaniardy hzd wc poor Spaniards 
been in your Cafe, we ftiould never have got- 
ten halfthofe Things out of the Ship, as you didl 
Nay, fays he, we Ihould never have found Means 
to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have 
gotten the Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail ; 
and how much lefs fliould we have done, faid he^ 
if any of us had been alone ? Well, I defir^d hini 
to abate his Compliment, and go on with the 
Hiftory of their coming on Shore, where they lan-

Place where there were People without Provifionsf 
whereas had they had the common Senfe to have 
putoflF to Sea again^ and gone to another Ifland 
a little farther, they had found Provifions, tho* 
without People; there being an Ifland chat Way, 
as they had been told, -w^here there was Provifi- 
ons, tho* no People; that is to fay. That the Spa- 
miards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and 
had fiird the Ifland with Goats and Hogs at feve- 
ral Times; where they have bred in fuch Multi- 
tudes, and where Turtle and Sea Fowls were in 
fiich Plenty, that they could ha^ been in no Want 
of Flefli, tho* they had found no Bread ; whereas 
here, they were only fuftain*d with a few Roots 
and Herbs, which they dnderflood not, and which 
had no Subftance in them, and which the Inha- 
bitants gave them fparingly enough, and who 
could treat them no better, unlefs they would turn 
Cannibals, and eat Mens Flefli, which was the 
great Dainty of their Country. 

They gave me an Account, how many Wavs 
they fl;rove to civilize the Savages they were with, 
and to teach them rational Cufioms in the ordi* 
nary Way of living, but in vain ; and how they 
retorted it upon them, as unjuft, that they who 
came there for Afliftaiice and Support, fliould at- 
tempt to fet up for Inftru&ors of thofe that gave 
them Bread ; intimating, it feems, that none fliouId 
Tet up for the Inftruftors of others, but thofe who 
could live without them.

that they could not in Reafon deny to go out 
with their Landlords to their Wars ,• fo when they 
tame into the Field of Battle, they were in a 
worfe Condition than the Savages thcmfelves ; for 
they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could

they could do nothings but ftandftill,and be woun-

would often drive a whole little Army before 
them with thofe Halberds and fliarpen'd Sticks 
put into the Muzzles of their Muskets : But that 
for all this they were fome Times furrounded with 
Multitudes, and in great Danger from their Ar- 
rows, 'till at laft they found the Way to make 
themfelves large Targets of Wood, which they co- 
vered with Skins of wild Beafts, whofe Names they 
. knew not i and thefe covered them from the Arrows 
of the Savages ; that notwithftanding thefe, they 
were fome Times in great Danger, and were once 
five of them knocked down together with the Clubs 
of the Savages, which was the time when one of 
them was taken Prifoner, that is to fay, the Spani-

had beenkill'd; but when afterwards they heard 
he was taken Prifoner, they were under the grea-

Teai< Captivity, I found a good Ship rca^y 
:o ca!r> me to my own Country: AU thefe 
1 ti ligs made me more fenfible of the Relation of 
' thole poor Men, and more a&ded with it. 

Having thus given a View of the State of 
Things, as I found them, I muft relate the Heads 
of what I did for thefe People, and the Condition m 
which I left them : It was their Opinion and mine 
too, that they would be troubled no more with 
the Savages ; or that if they were, they would be 
able to cut them oft if they were twice as many 
as before; fo they had no Concern about that : 
Then I entred into a ferious Difcourfe with the 
Sfaniard, who I call Governour, about their Stay 
in the Ifland ; for as I was not come to carry any oi 
them off, fo it would not be juft to carry off fomc, 
and leave others, who perhaps would be unwil- 
ling to ft ay, if their Strength was diminiflied. 

On the other hand, I told them, I came to e- 
ftablifli them there, not to remove them; and 
then I let them know, that I had brought with me 
* Relief of fundry Kinds for them ; That I had 
been at a great Charge to fupply them with all 
Things neceflfary, as well for their Convenience, 
as their Defence ; and that I bad fuch and fuch 
particular Perfons with me, as well to encreafc 
and recruit their Number, as by the particular 
neceffary Employments which they were bred to, 
t>cing Artificers, to affifl them in thofe Things, in 
which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to 
them ; and before I deliver'dto them the Stores 
I had brought, I askM them, one by one, If they 
had entirely forgot and bury'd the firft Animofi-

I told him, his Carriage wasfo modeft)thae 
I could not but acknowledge it; that it was true, 
we were fuch People as they calPd Hereticks ; 
but that he was not the firft Catholick that I 
had conversed with, without falh'ng into any 
Inconveniencies, or carrying the Qiieftions to 
any height in Debate : That he Ihould not find 
himfelf the worfe ufed for being of a different 
Opinion from us, and if wc did not convcrfc 
without any Diilikc on either Side upon that 
Score^ it (hould be his Fault, not ours. 

He reply'd, that he thought all ourConverfa- 
tion might be eafily feparated from Difputcs; 
That it was not his Bufiaefs to cap Principles 
with every Man he difcours'd with ; and tnaC 
he rather defir'd me to converfe with him as 
a Gentleman, than as a Religieufei that if I

be allow^ to fay fo-, a Man of good Sence, ailci

He gave mc a moft diverting Account of his 
Life, and of the many extraordinary Events 
of it; of many Adventures which had befallen 
him in the few Years that he had been abroad 
in the World, and particularly this was very re- 
markable, (viz>.') That in the Voyage he was nour 
engaged in ; he had had the Misfortune to be five 
timerihip'd and unfhip'd, and never to go to the 
Place whether any of the Ships he was in^ were 
at firft defignM : That his firft Intent was to have 

fonc to Martinko^ and that he went on board a 
hip bound thither^ at St. Malo; but being 
forced into Lisbonhy bad Weather, the Ship te- 
ceiVd'fome Damage, by running a Ground in 
the Mouth of the Kivcriagus^ and was obliged to 
unload her Cargo there •, that finding a Portnguefe 
Ship there bound to ih^Maderas^znd ready to fail,

to Fial'^ where, however, be happcn'd to find 
a very good Market for his Cargo, wliich was 
Corn, and therefore refolv'd not to go to the 
Maderasy but to load Salt at thclpof May, and 
to go away to Newfoundland : He had no Reme-

among us all the while we were upon the Ifland; 
and it happened to be juft when I was going to 
vifit the Englijb Men's Colony, at the fartheft Part

with a very grave Countenance, that he had for 
two or three Days defirM an Opportunity of fomc 
Difcourie with me, which he hop*d fliould not be 
difpleafing to me, becaufe he thought it might in 
fome Meafure correfpond with my general Defign, 
which was the Profperity of my new Colony^ and 
perhaps might put it, at leaft more than he yet 
thought it was, in the Way of God's Bleffing.

Leave to lay down a few Propofitions, as the 
Foundation of what I have tb fay, that we may 
not differ in the general Principles, tho' we may

very unhappy that it is fo, efpeeially in the Cafe be-

fome general Principles in which we both agree*

having given us fome fta ted general Rules for put 
Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly 
and knowingly to offend him,- either by ncgleftirig 
to do what he has con^manded, or by doing, what 
he has exprefly forbidden : And let our different 
Religions be what the)^ will, this general Principle 
is readily own*d by us all. That the Bleffing of 
God does not ordinarily follow a prefumptuous 
{inning againfi his Command ; and every good 
thriftian Will be aflfeftionatcly concerned to pre- 
vent any that are under his Care, living in a total

Why then. Sir, fays he, I will take the Liber* 
ty you give me; and there are three Things, 
which, if I am right, muft Hand in the Way of 
God's Bleffing, upon your Endeavours here, and 
which I fhould rejoice for your Sake and their 
own to fee removed. And Sir, iays he, I promifc

ihall convince you, that every one of them nuy> 
with great Eafe, and very much to your Sati^fa-

men from among the Savages, and have taken 
them as their Wives, and have had many Chil- 
dren by them all, and yet are not marryM to them 
after any ftated legal Manner, as the Laws of 
God and Man require ; and therefore are yet, in 
the Sence of both, no Icfs than Adulterersy and li- 
ving in Adultery. To this. Sir, fays he, I know 
you will objed, that there was no Clergy-man 
or Prieft, of any Kind, or of any Profeffion, to 
perform the Ceremony ; nor any Pen, and Ink, or 
Paper, to write down a Contraft of Marriage, 
and have it fign'd between them : And I know 
alfo, Sir, what the Spaniard Governour has told 
you, I mean, of the Agreement that he obliged 
theniKo make, when they took thefe Women (viz,^) 
That they fhould chufe them out by Confent, and

Wottieh, as Wives, but only an Agreement among' 
themfelves, to keep them from quarrelling. ^ 

But, Sir, the Eflcncc of the Sacrament of Ma- 
trimony (lb he caird it, being a Roman) confifts 
not only in the mutual Gonfent of the Parties to 
take one another, as Man .and Wife^ but in tht 
formal and legal Obligation, that there is in the 
Conttaft, to compel the Man and Woman at all 
Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obli- 
ging the Men to abftain from all other Women, to 
engage in no other Contrad while thefe* fubfift; 
and on allOccafions, as Ability allows, to pro- 
vide honeftly for them and their Children, and to 
oblige the Women, to the fame or like ConditionSt 
mutatis mutandis^ jiyn their Side. 

Now, Sir, fays he^ Thefe Men may, when they 
pleafe, or when Occafion prefents, abandon thefe 
Women, difown their Children, leave them to pe- 
rilh, and take other Women, and marry them 
while thefe are living; and here he added, with 
fome Warmth, How, Sir, is God honourM in this 
unlawful Liberty ? And how flhall a Bleffing fuc-

jeds, under your abfolute Government and Do- 
minion, are allowed by you to live in open A-

Men to own thcfc Women for their Wives, upon 
Sill Qccafions, and never to abandon them or their 
Children, and the Women to the fame with their

in the Sight of God ; and it was a great Kegl^ 
that it was hot done. 

But i thought to have gotten off with my young 
Prieft, by telling him, that all that Part was done 
when I was not here, and they had liv'd fo many

it was paft Remedy, they could do nothing in it 
now* 

Bitifays bif asking you Pardon for fuch Preedonty you 
arc right in this, that it being done in your Ab-

Able to take of it now. You know. Sir, faid A

Eaft-Indies in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and 
to whom it would b^ an unfuflerable Piece of In- 
jufticeto detain, their Ship here, the Men lying 
€ll this while at Viftuals and Wages upon the 
Owners Account. It is true, I agreed to be al- 
lowM 12 Days here, and if I ftay more^ I muft 
pay 3 /. Sterling per Dipn Demorage, nor can I 
llay upon Demorage above ^ight Days more, and 
I have been here 13 Days already, fo that I am 
perfcdly unable to engage in this Work, unlefs I 
would fiiffer my felf to be left behind here again, 
in which Cafe if this fingle Ship fliould nuTcarry 
in any Part of her Voyage, I fhould be juft in 
the fame Condition that I was left in here at 
firft, and from which I have been fo wonderfully 
iJelivered. 

He own'd the Cafe was very hard upon me, as 
to my Voyage J but laid it home upon my Con- 
science, whether the Blelfing of faving feven and 
thirty Souls, was not worth my venturing all I 
had in the World for; I was not fo fenfible ot that 
^ he was ? I returned upon him thus, v/hy. Sir, 
it is a valuable Thing indeed to be anlnftrument^ 
in God's Hand to convert feven and thirty Hea-^ 
thens to the Knowledge of Chrift, but as you 
are an Ecclefiaftic, and are given over to the 
Work, fo that it fcems fo naturally to fall into

God and you, Sir, fays he^ for giving me fo cvi- 
(dent a Call to fo blefleda Work, and if you think 
your fdf difcharg'd from it, and defire mc to un- 
dertake it, I will moil readily do it, and think it 
^ happy Reward for aU the Hjizards and DifE-* 
cutties of fuch a broken difappointed Voyage as 
i have met with, that \ may be drop'd at laft into 
fo glorious a Work. 

I diicovcr'd a kind of Rapture in his Face, 
while he fpoke this to me ; his Eyes fparkl'd 
like Fire, his Face glow'd, and his Colour came 
and went, as if he had been falling into Fits ; 
in ^ word, be was fir'd with the Joy of being 
cnibarkM in fuch a Work. I paus'd a conftdc- 
rable while before I could tell what to fay to 
him, for I was really furpriz'd to find a Man of 
{uch Sincerity and Zeal, and carry 'd out in his 
Zieal beyond the ordinary rate of Men, not of his 
Profeffion only, but even of any Profeffion what- 
foever. But after I had confider'd it a while, I 
ask'd him ferioufly if he was in earneft and that 
he would venture on the fingle Confideration of 
an Attempt on thofe poor People, to be lock'd 
up in an unplaated Ifland for, perhaps, his Life, 
and at laft might not know whether he fhould b§ 
'able to do them any Good, or not ? 

He tum'd Abort upon mc, and ask'd me what I 
call'd a Venture? Pray, Sir, faidhe, what do 
you think I confentcd to go in your Ship to the 
Eaft-Ifidies for ? Nay, faid /, that I know nor^j 
unlefs it was to Preach to the Indians : Doubt- 
iefs it was, faid he ; and do you think, if I 
can convert thcfe feven and thirty Men to the 
Faith of Chrift, it is not worth my time, tho* I 
fiiould never be fetched off the Ifland again ;

Eyes were open, believe, that his old Mafter was 
a Heretick and would be damn'd, and this

of much lefs Value than the keeping or parting 
with a Servant ; But on the other hand, I was per-? 
fua4^49 that Friday would by no Means confent to 
p^rt with me, and I could not force him to it 
iyichout his Confent, without manifeft Injuftice, 
btecaufc I had promifed I would never put him a-

that he would never leave me, unlefs I put him

He feem'd very much concern'd ^t it, for he 
had no rational Accefs to thefe poor People, fee- 
ing he did not underftand one word of their Lan-

this Difficulty, I told him, Fridays Father had

them their V/ivcSi and have fo many Children by 
them, and not ♦be marry M lawfully to them.

(viz,,) that there was no Body to marry them ; 
that they agreed before the Governour to keep 
them as their Wives ; and to keep them, and own 
them as their Wives ; and they thought as 
Things flood with them, they were as legally 
faiarried, as if they had been married by a Parfon^ 
and with all the Formalities in the World. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married 
in the Sight of God, and were bound in Confci- 
enee to keep them as their Wives, but that the 
Laws of Men being otherwife, they might pre- 
tend they were not married, and fo defect the poor 
Women and Children hereafter ; and that their 
Wives being poor defolate Women, friendlefs and 
monilefs, would have no way to help them- 
felves. I therefore told them, that unlefs I was 
affur'd of their hopeft Intent, I could do no- 
thing for them ; but would take Care that 
what I didj Ihould be for the Women and their 
Children without them^ and that unlefs they 
would give fome Affurances, that they would 
marry the Women, I could not think it was C9n- 
venient they fliould continue together as Man 
and Wife, for that it was both feandalous to 
Men, and offenfive to God, who they could not 
think would blefs them, if they went on thus.

All this went on as I cxpcdcdi and they told 
tnc, cfpecially JVdl. Atkins^ who fecmM now to 
fpcak for the reft ; that they loved their Wivrs 
as well, as if they had been born in their own na* 
tivc Country, and would not leave them upon a- 
ny Account whatever ; and they did verily be- 
lieve their Wives were as virtuous and as modcftj 
and did to the utmoft of their Skill, as much for 
them, and for their Children, as any Women 
could poffibly do, and they would not part with 
them on any Account : And tVill. Atkins for his 
own Particular, added, if any Man would take 
him away, and offer to carry him home to £«- 
glands and make him Captain of the beft Man of 
War in the Navy, he would not go with him, 
if he might not carry his Wife arid Children with 
hjlm, and if there was a Clergy-man iri the Ship, 
he would be married to her bow with all his 
Heart. 

This was juft as I would have it ; the Prieft 
was npt with me at that Moment, but was not 
far off: So to try him farther, I told him I had 
a Clergy-man with me, and if he was fincere, I 
would have him married the next Morning, and 
bid him confider of it, and talk with the reft ; 
hefaid, as for himfelf, he need not confider of it 
at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was 
glad I had a Minifter with me, and he bcliev^^ 
they would be all willing alfo. I then told him 
that my Friend the Minifter was a French Man,

the Clerk between them : He never fo much as 
ask*dme whethet he was Papift or Proteftant,

Atkins went in to talk with his Companions. I 
defir'd the French Gentleman not to fay any thing 
to them, till the Bufinefs was thorough ripe, and 
I told him what Anfwer the Men had given me. * 

Before I went from their Quarter, they all 
came to me, and told me, they had been con(i- 
dering what I had faid, that they were very glad 
to hear I had a Clergy-man in my Company, and 
they were very willing to give me the Satis&di- 
on I defir'd, and to be formally Married as foon 
as I pleased, for they were far from defiring to 
part with their Wives, and that they meant no* 
thing but what was very honeft when they chofe 
them ; fo I appointed them to meet me the next 
Morning, and that in the mean time they fhould 
let their Wives know the meaning of the Mar- 
riage-Law; and that it was not only to prevent 
any Scandal, but alfo to oblige them, that they 
fhould not forfake them, whatever might happen. 

The Women were eafily made fenfible of the 
Meaning of the Thing, and were very well fatis-

at firft I was a little backward to it, yet at laii 
I agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving thfc 
Sincerity of his Defign.

was very willing tb perform that Par? of his Fun-; 
aion, and marry them as 1 had defir'd ; but that 
before he could do it, he muft take the Liberty 
to talk with them. He told them, that in the

that nothing but the Confenting to marry, or ef-

could put an End to it ; but there was a Difficul-

an Matrimony, which he was not fully fatisty'd 
about, viz,. That of marrying one that is a pro-

He told them, he doubted they Vp'crc but in^'

therefore, he could not exped that they had faid 
much to their Wives on that Head yet ; but that 
unlefs they would promife him to ufe their En-

Why, truly ^r/fe/«ii /^/rf /, I atA afraid thou

was itnpaticnt to know: O! faidthe Priefi \ tell 
hrm there is one Thing will make him , the beft 
Minifter in the World to his Wife, and that is. 
Repentance ; for none teach Repentance like true 
Penitents : He wants nothing but to repent, md 
than he will be fo much the better qualify^d to 
inftruft his Wife : He will be then able to tell her, 
that there is not only a God, and that hi is the 
juft Rewarderof Good and Evil, but that he is a 
merciful Being, and with infinite Goodnefs and 
Long-fuftering, forbears to punifli thofethatof* 
fend, waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 
Death of a Sinner, but rather that he mould re- 
turn and live; that often-timcs fuflfers wicked 
Men to go on a long Time, and even referves 
Damnation to the general Day of Retributi- 
on; that it is a clear Evidence of God, and of a. 
future State, that righteous Men receive not their 
Reward, or wicked Men their Punilhment, 'till 
they come into another World ; and this will lead 
him to teach his Wife the Dodrine of the Refur- 
tcftion, and of the laft Judgment; let him but re- 
pent for himfclf, he will be an excellent Preacher 
of Repentance to his Wife»

Having thus brought the Affair of the I (land

taken out of the familh'd Ship's Company came 
CO me, and told mc, he underftood 1 had a Cler-

two Chriftians, which hehop'd would not be dil-

I knew this muft be the young Woman who 
was his Mother's Servant, for there was no o- 
ther Chridian Woman on the Ifland ; fo I began 
to perfuadchim not to do any Thing' of that

not above fcventcen or eighteen ; that he might 
very probably with myAffiftance^makea remove 
from this Wildernefs and come into his own 
Country again, and that then it would be a 
thoufand to one buj he would repent his Choice; 
and the Diflike of that Circumftance might be 
difadvantagious to both: 1 was going to fay more

him quite out of the Reach of all hisFnchdsj 
that ne had nothing to deiircof me^ but that I 
would fettle him in fome little Property in the 
liland where he was, give him a Servant or two 
and fome few Neceffaries, and he would fcttJc 
himfelf here like a Piancer^ waiting the good 
Time^ when if ever I returned to England^ I would 
redeem him, and hop'd (would not be unmiad"

to hinij and in what Part of chcWorld, and what 
Circumftancel had left him in; that he pro- 
mifcd me, that when ever I redeemed him, the 
Plantation and all the Improvements he had 
made upon it* let the Value be what it would, 
Ihould bewholly mine, 

HisDifcourfe was very prettily delivered, con- 
fidering his Youth, and was the more agreeable 
to me, bccaufe he told me pofitively the Match 
was not for himfelf: I gjive him all poffiblc Af-

would deliver his Letters and do his Bufinefs ef-

Perfon to be married^ upon which he told me it

and a certain Rent for every particular Plantati- 
on after eleven Years, if I or any one from me 
or in my Name came to demand it, producing 
an attefted Copy of the fame Writing. 

As to the Government and Laws among them, 
I told them I was not capable of giving them 
better Rules, than they were able to give them ; 
Iclves, only made them promifc me to live in 
Love and good' Neighbourhood with one ano-

One Thing I muft not omit and this is^ that

Wealth among themfelves^ and having much 
Bufinels in Hand, it was but odd to have feven 
and thirty Indians live in a Nook of the Ifland, 
independent, and indeed utt-employ'd ; for ex-

they had Difficulty enough in too, fometimes, 
they had no Manner of Bufineisor Property to

Spaniard^ that he fliould go to them with Eriday^s 
Father, and propose to them to remove ^ and 
cither plant tor themfelves^ or rake them into 
their feveral Families as Servants to be maintaio'd

Slaves, for I would not admit them to make

tiod, and as it were Articles of Surrender^* which 
they ought not to break. 

They mofl: wilh'ngly embracM the Propofal^' 
and came all very ehcarfully along with him ; 
fo we allotted them Land, ana Plantations, 
which three or four accepted of, but all the reft 
chofe to be employed as Servants in the feveral 
Families we had fettled \ and thus my Colony 
was in a Manner fettled, as follows : The^y^^-

was the capital City^ and extended their Planta- 
tions all along the Side of the Brook, which 
made the Creek tlut I have fo often defcrib'd,^ 
as far as my Bower ; and as they encreafed their 
Culture, it went always Eaftward ; the EngliJB 
iiv'd in the North- Eaft Part, where TV. Atkins^ 
and his Comrades began, and came onSduthward^- 
and South- Weft, towards the back Part of the 
Spaniards ; add every Plantation had a great Ad- 
dition of Land to take iri, if thev found Occafi- 
on ; fo'rfiat they nded hot joftle one another 
for want of Room. 

All the Eaft End of the Ifland was left uninha- 
bited, that if any of the lavages (hoiild come on 
Shore there only for their ufual cuftomary Bar^ 
barities they might come and go, if thev difturb'd 
ho Bodyj no Bddy Would difturb tnem ; and 
no doubt but they were often afliore, and went 
away again ; for I never heard that the Planters 
were ever attacked or difturb'dany rtsore.

Pirates, and fo made the liland a Den of Thieves, 
inftead of a Plantation of fober and religious

two Pieces of Brafs Cannon that I had on Board,

firudion upon themfelves and all their Underta-

for their Service another Way, as I fliall obfervc 
in its Place, 

I have now done with the Ifland ; I left them 
all in good Circumftances, and in a flourifhing:

Opportunity; and particularly I promised to fend 
them fome Cattel, fuch as Sheep, Hogs, and 
Cows : For as to the two Cows and Calves which 
I brought from England, we had been obliged by 
the Length of our Voyage to kill them at Sea, for 
want of Hay to feed them.

it was, 'till after fomc Time, our chief Mate go- 
ing up the main Shrowds a little W^y, and look-

an Army. I could not imagine what he meant 
by an Army, and fpoke a little haftily, calling the 
Fellow a Fool, or fome fuch Word : Nay, Sir,

terrible Stories of them in thelfland, and having 
never been in thofe Seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but (aid two or three 
Times, we fliould all be devoured. I muft confefs,

However, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the 
Ship to an Anchor, as foon as we Came fo near 
to know that we muft engage them. 

The Weather continued calm, and they came 
on apace towards us ; fo I gave Order to come 
to an Anchor, and furle all our Sails : As for the 
Savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but 
Fire ; and therefore they fhould gee their Boats out, 
and faften them, one clofe by the Head, and the o- 
ther by the Stern, and man them both well, and 
wait the Iffue in that Pofture : This I did, that 
the Men in the Boats might be ready with Skeets 
and Buckets to put out any Fire thefe Savages 
might endeavour to fix tothe Out-fide of the Ship.

They were not above half a Cable Length otf 
when we fir'dj and our Gunners took their Aim 
To well, that three or four of their Canoes were 
bverfet, as we had Reafon to believe, by one Shot

The ill Manners of turning up their bare Back-

I know for certain, whether that which would pafs 
for the greateft Contempt among us, might be un-* 
derftood fo by them, or not ; therefore, in Re- 
turn, I had only relolv'd to have fir*d four or five

would fright them fufficicntly : But when they

We went now away with a fair Wind for Bra^ 
fily ahdin abdirtrtwclve Days Time we made Land 
in the Latitude of five Dterees South of the Line, 
being the North-Eaftertfioft Land of all that Part 
of America. We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the 
Shore four Days, when we ^ade Cape St. Augu- 
flinej and in three Days came to an Anchor oft of 
' the Bay oj all Saints, the old Phce of my Delive- 
rance, from whence came both my good and evil 
Fate. ^ , , 

Never Ship came to this Part that had lefs Bu- 
Vfinefs than I had; and yet it was with great Diffi- 
'culty that we were admitted to hold the leaft 
Correfpondence on Shore, not my Partner himfdf, 
; who was alive,' and makle a great Figure among 
them; not my two Merchants Tmllees, not the 
TFameofmy w'onderful Prefervation in the Ifland, 
could obtain me that Favour : But my Partner rc- 
membririg, that I had given 500 i^oidpres to the 
Prior of theMonaftery t)f the Auguftinesy and 272 
to the Poor, wient to the Monaftery, atld oblig^'d 
the Prior that then was, tb go to the Governoar, 
and get Leave for me pjerfonally, with the Captain 
zxA one one itiore befides eight Seamen, to come 
on Shore, and no more; and this upon Condition 
abfolutely capitulated for, that we fhould not of- 
fer to land any Goods out of the Ship, or to carry 
' any Perfon away without Licence. 

They were fo fttid with us, as to landing any 

' Goods; that it was with extream Difficulty that 

I got on Shore three Bales oiEngUfi Goods, fuch

as fine broad Cloaths^ Stu£E?, and fome LinncH 
which I had brought for a Prefent to my Partner. 

He was a very generous broad hearted Man, 
tho* like me, he came from little at firft ; and tho' 
he knew not that I had the leaft Defign of giving 
him any Thing, he fent me on Board a Prefent of. 
frelh Proviiions, Wine, and Sweet-meats, worth 
above 30 Moidores, including fome Tobacco, 
and three or four fine Medals in Gold : But I was 
even with him in my Prefent, which, as 1 have 
faid, confifted of fine broad Cloath, Englijb Scptfs, 
Lace, and fine Hollands : Alfo I deliver'd him 
about the Value of 100 Hi. Sterl. in the fame 
Goods for other Ufes; and I obliged him to 
fet up the Sloop which I had brought with me 
from England, as I have faid, for the Ufe of my 
Colony, in order to fend the Refrefhments I inten- 
ded to my Plantation. 

Accordingly he got Hands, and finifhy the 
Sloop in a very few Days, for (he was already 
framM, and I gave the Mafter of her fuch Inftru- 
Aions, as he could not mifs the Place ; nor did he 
ntifs them, as J had an Account from my Partner afier^ 
'Wards. I got him foon loaded with the fmall 
Cargoe I fent them ; and one of our Seamen that 
had been on Shore with me there, offered to go 
with the Sloop, and fettle there upon my Letter 
to the Governour Spaniard, to allot him a fufHci- 
ont Quantity of Land for a Plantation ; and giving 
him (ome Cloaths, and Tools for his Planting- 
Work, which he faid he underftood, having been 
an old Planter 2X Maryland, and a Buckaneer in*

I cnccorag'd the Fellow, by granting all he de- 
fir'd ; ahd as an Addition, I gave him the Savage, 
which ^^e had taken Prifoner of War^ to be. his 
slave, and ordered the Govemour Spdniard to give 
him his Share of every Thing lie wanted, with 
the reft. 

When we came to fit this Man out, my old 
Pirtnet told me, there was i certain very honeft 
Fellow^ a B^afil Planter of his Acquaintance, who 
had faQeh into the Difpleafure of the Church ; I 
know not v^hat the Matter is with him, fays hey 
but on my Cohfcience, I think he is a Heretick 
in his Heairt, and he has been obligM to conceal 
himfelf for Fear of the Inquiiition ; that he wou'd 
be very glad of fuch an Opportunity to make his 
Efcape with his Wife and two Daughters ; and if 
I would let them go to my Ifland, and allot them 
a Plantation, he would give them a fmall Stock to^ 
begin with j for the Officers of the Inquifition 
had feiz'd all his Efieds and Eftate, and he had 
nothing left but a little Houfliold-StufF and two 
Slaves. And adds hey Tho' I hate his Principles, 
yet I would not have him fall into their Hands ; 
tor he would afluredly be burnt alive, if he 
does. 

I granted this prefently, and joind my En^lifb 
Man with thensi, and we conceard the Man, and 
his Wife, and Daughters on Board our Ship, 'till 
the Sloop put out to go to Sea ; and then ^(having 
put all their Goods on Board the Sloop, fome 
Time before) we put them on Board the $Joop,

when we faw the People, we cut three Boughs out

lb that you are perfcftly fccure within the three

any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce

It happened one Evening when we went on

came down than ufual, but all was very friend-

They told me, like Scamcri^they would warrant

confidcr the Ship and the Voyage ; that their Lives 
were not their own, and that they were entruftcd

caftidd, the Ship might be loft for want of their

give them their due, they went about it as wari-

Mufquct , a Bayonet, every Man a Piftoi , 
fome of them had broad Cutlafics, fome of rhcm

when they went out^ their chief Defign was 
Plunder, and they were in mighty Hopes of find- 
ing Gold there ; but a Circumftance which none 
ot them were aware of, fet them on Fire with 
Revenge, and made Devils of them all. When 
they came to the few Indian Houfes which they 
thought had been the Town, which was not 4- 
bovc Haifa Mile off; they were under a great 
Difappoincmcnt, for there was not above twelve 
pr thirteen Houfes, and where the Town was, 
or how big, they knew not ; they confultcd 
therefore what to do^and was fome Time before 
they could reiqlve i for if they fell upon thcfe, 
they muft cut all their Throats, and it was ten 
to one but fome of them might efcapc, it being 
in the Night, tho' the Moon was up; and if one 
<:fcap'd, he would run away and raife all the 
Town, fo they Ihould have a whole Army upon 
them ; again on the other Hand, if they went a- 
way and left thofe untouched, for the People were 
all afleep, they could pot tell which Way to 
look for the Town. 

However, the laft was the beft Advice, fo 
they rcfolv'd to leave them, and look for the 
Town as well as ihcy could, they went on ^ 
lirtle Way, and found a Cow ty*d to a Tree •, 
fhis they prefently concluded would be a good 
Guide to them ; tor they faid, the Cow certain- 
ly bclongM to the Town before them, or the 
Town benind rbeni; and iftheyunty*d her they

of thefc, they found fcveral Families living toge-

Here they found all in Silence^ as profoundly 
fccure, as Sleep, and a Country that bad never 
fecn an Enemy of that Kind could make them ^ 
and firft, they caird another Council, to conli- 
der what they had to do s and in a Word, they 
refolv'd to divide themfelvcs into three Bodies,

the reft of the Houfes for Plundct' ,• but they re-

might venture upon it or no. 

They did fo, and defpcratelv refoly'd that rhcy 
would venture upon them ; but while they were 
^mimating one another to the Work, three of 
them that were a little before the reft, call'd out 
aloud to them, and told them they had found 
Thorn. Jeffry^ they all run up to the Place, and 
fo it was indeed; for there they found the poor 
JFellow hang'd up naked by one Arm, and his 
Throat cut; there was an Inditin Houfc juft by 
iheTree, where they found lixteenor fevcnteea 
of the principal Indians who had been concerned in

the Country is full ; fo they prefently made fomc 
wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Pow- 
der in the Palms of their Hands, and in a quarter 
of an Hour, they fct the Town on Fire in four pf 
five Places; and particularly that Houfe where 
the Indians were not gotie to Bed. As foon as the 
Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures 
began to rufli out to fave their Lives, but met

to go in butcaird for a Hand-Grenado, and threw 
it among them, which at firft frighted them, but

All this while they fir^d not a Gan, becaufc 
they would not waken the People fafter t'han they 
could mafter them; but the Fire began to waken 
them faft enough, and our Fellows were glad t6 
keep a little together in Bodies ; for the Fire grew 
fo raging, all the Houfes being made of light 
combuftible Stoff, that they could hardly bear the 
Street between them, and their Bufinefs was to 
follow the Fire for the furer Execution : As faft 
as the Fire either forc'd the People out of thofe 
Houfes which were burning, or frighted them out 
of others, our People were ready at their Doors 
to knock them on the Head, ftill calling and hal- 
lowing to one another to remember T'hBm. Jeffries.

He was furprizM to fee me and the Supra-cargo 
in the Boat with no more than two Men ; and tho* 
he was glad that wc were well, yet he was in the 
fame Impatience with us to know what was doing; 
for the Noife continu^d^ and the Flame encreas'd : 
In(hort, it was next to an Impol&bility, for any 
Men in the World, to reftrain their Curiofity, to 
know what had happenM, or the Concern for the 
Safety of the Men : In a word, the Captain told 
me he would go and help his Men, let what 
would come. I zvgad with him, as I did before,

of the Voyage, the Interefts of the Owners and 
Merchants, &c. and told him, I would go and the 
two Men, and only fee if we could at a Diflance 
learn what was like to be the Event, and come

It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was

went he.

thisMifchiefoD. 

Being new on the Mirch, you may be fure w^ 
fdt little of the Ground we trode on ; and being 
guided by the Fire, we kept no Path, but went 
Sireaiy to the Place of the Fiame : If the Noife 
of the Guns was fnrprifing to us before ; the Cries 
^the poor People were now of quite another Na- 
ture, and fiU'd us with Horror. I muft confefs, I 
never was at the facking a City, or at the taking 
a Town by Storm. I had heard of Oliver Cram- 
itiiS toking Drogheda in Ireland^ and killing Man, 
Woman, and Child: And I had read of Count 
TtSy^ Ckcking o(tht City oiMagdeburghf and cut- 
ting the Throats of 22000 of all Sexes: But I ne- 
ver had an Idea of the Thing itfelf before, nor is 
it poffible to defcribe it, or the Horror that was 
upon our Minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to 
the Town, tho' there was no entring the Streets of 
it for the Fire : The firft Objeft we met with was 
the Ruins of a Hut or Houfe, or rather rhc AQies 
of it, for the Houfe was confum^'d; and juft, before 
it, plain now to be feen by the Light of the Fire, 
lay four Men and three Women kill'd ; and as 
we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap a- 
mong the Fire : In Ihort,, there were fuch Inftances 
of a Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, 
fbmething beyond what was human, that we 
thought it impoffiblc our Men could be guilty of 
it, ot if they were thfe Authors of it, we thought 
they ought to be every one of them put to the 
worft ot Deaths: But this was not all, we faw

Women naked, and crying in a raoft dreadfiil Man-

and after them iixtcen or feventeen Men, Natives, 
in the fame Terror and Confternation, with three 
of OLir Englijh Butchers, for I can call them no bet- 
ter, in their Rear, who, when they could not O- 
vertake them, fir'd in among them, and one that 
was kiird by their Shot fell down in our Sight ; 
when the reft faw us, believing us to be their 
Enemies, and that we would murther them as 
well as thofe that purfu'd them, they fet up a 
moft dreadful Shreik, efpecially the Women; atid 
two of them fell down as if already dead with the 
Fright, 

My very Soul flhrunk within me, and my Blood

them come on, I had made our Men kill them all: 
However we took fome Ways to let the poor fly- 
ing Creatures know, that we would not hurt them, . 
and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling 
down, with their Hands lifted up, made piteous 
Lamentation to us to fave them, which we let 
them know we would ; whereupon they crept al- 
together in a Huddle clofe behind us, as for Pro- 
tedion. I left my Men drawn up together, and 
charg'd them to hurt no Body, but if poffible to 
get at fome of our People, and fee what Devil it 
was poflefs'd them, and what they intended to do; 
and in a word, to command them off; affuring

and there w4$ indeed a piteous Spedacle among 
them : Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt' 
with trampling and running thro' the Fire, others 
their Hands burnt ; one of the Women had fallen 
down in the Fire, and was very much burnt before 
ihe could get out again, and two or three of the

But the Dread of them w^s upon the whole

The next Day we fet fail,' fo we never heard 
any more of it : Our Men differed in the Account 
of the Number they kill'd : Some faid one Thing, 
fome another ; but according to th^ beft of their 
Accduftts put alti^etherj they kill'd 6t deftroy'd 
abdut 150 People, Men, Women, and Children^ 
and left not a Houfe ftanding in the Towtf. 

As for the poor Fellow Tho. jfefrys^ as he was 
quite dead, for his Throat was fo cut, that his 
Head was half off, it would do him no Service ta 
bring him away, fo they left him where they 
found him, only took him down from the Tree,' 
where he was hang!d by one Hand. 

However juft our Men thought this Aftion, I. 
was againft them in it; and I always, after that 
Time, told them, God would blaft the Voyage; 
for I look'd upon all the Blood they flied that Night 
to be Murther in them: For tho' it is true/

not, and that that the War was begun the Night 
before by the Natives themfelves, who had (hot

ber of thofe who went on Shore to the MafTacre 
of Mada^fiar; (fo J always call'd it, tho^ our Men 
could not hear the Word M^flacre viith any Patience :) 
And indeed, this laft Circumftance, as I have faid, 
put me to Silence for the prefent. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this 
Subjed bad worfe Confequences than I expeded ; 
and the Boatfwain, who had been the Head of 
the Attempt, came up boldly to me one Time^ 
andtoIdme,hefound> that I continually brought 
that A£Eair upon the Stage, that I made unjuft Re- 
fledions upon it, and had ufed the Men. very ill on 
that Account, and himfelfin particular; that as 
I was but a PaiTenger, and had no Command in 
the Ship, or Concern in the Voyage, they were 
not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know, 
but I mighfhave fome ill Defign in my Head, 
and'perhaps to call them to Account for it, when 
they came to England; and that therefore, unlefs 
1 would refolve to have done with it, and alfo, 
not to concern myfcjf any farther with him, or any 
of his Affiurs, he would leave the Ship ; for he 
did not think it w^s fafe tq fail with me among 
them. ^ 

I heard him patiently enough 'till he had done, 
and then, told him, that I did confefs I had all a- 
long opposed the Majfacre of Mndagafcar^ for fuch I 
would always call it; and that I had on all Occa- 
fions fpoken my Mind freely about ity tho' not 
more upon him than any of the rcft : That as to 
my having no Command in the Ship, that was 
true; nor did I exercifcany Authority, only took 
my Liberty of fpeaking ipy Mind in Things which

publickly conccm'd us all; and what Concern t 
had in the Voyage was none of his Baltnefs; that 
I was a confiderable Owner of the Ship ; and in 
that Claim I conceived I had a Right to fpeak e-* 
ven farther than I had yet done, and would not bt 
accountable to him or any one elfe, and begun t6 
be a little warm with him : He made but littk 
Reply to me at that Time, and I thought that 
Affair had been over. We Were at this Time ill 
the Road at J?^^^^, and being willing to fee th« 
Place, I Went" on Shore with th^ Supra-Cargo ia 
the Ship^s Bpat, to divert myfelf, and towards £•* 
vening was preparing to goon Board, when one 
of the Men came to me, and told me, he would 
not have me trouble teyfelf to come down to the 
Boat, iov they had Orders not to carry me oti 
Board any more. Any one may gueft what a Sur- 
prize I was in at fo infolent a Meffage; and I 
ask*d the Mati, Who bad him deliver that Errand 
to me ? He told me, the Cockfwain. I faid na 
more to the Fellow, but bad him let them know 
he had delivered his Meffage, and that I had gi- 
ven him no Anfwer to it. 

i immediately went and found out the Supra-' 
Cargo, and told him the Stoty, adding what t 
prelently forcfaw, (vit^,) That there would cer- 
tainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and entreated him 
to go iiflmediately on Board the Ship in an Indian 
Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it: But I might 
haTpar'dthis Intelligence ; for before I had fpoken 
to him on Shore, theMatter waseffefted on BoardJ 
The Boatfwain, the Gunner, the Carpenter; and 
in a Word, all the Inferiour Officers, as foon as I

Tor the FclIoW talk'd very well, and repeating aU

That as I was no^ gone peaceably on Shore, they 
were loth to ufc any Violence with me ; which, 
i£ I had not gorie onSjiore, they would otherwife 
have doncjto oblige me to have gone : I'hcy there-

thcmfelves to ferve in the Ship under his Conv 
mand, they would perform it well and faithfully : 
But if I would not quit the Ship, or the Captain 
oblige Hie to quit it, they would all leave the 
Ship, and fail po farther with him ; and at that 
Word, ALL, he tum*d his Face about towards 
the Main-maft, which was it feems the Signal a- 
greed on betw«n them ; at which, all the Sea- 
men being got together, there cry'd o^t. One and 
ALL, One and ALL.

his Face, that they would go ail on Shore, unlefs 
he would engage to them, not to fufier me to come 
any more on Board the Ship. 

This was a hard Article up6n him, who knew his 
Obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; fo he began to talk cavalierly to thcm,told

he would rather lofe tneShip and the Voyage too,

which howeiFer had a Dtpth enough of Water 
for u^ and to fee if we ccuid> either over Land, or 
by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know what 
Ships were in any Port thercaboats. This happy 
Step, was indeed our Deliverance ; for tho' we 
did not immediately fee any European Ships in the 
Bay of Tinfum^ yet the next Morning there came 
into the Bay two Dutib Sbips^ and a third with- 
out any Colours fpread out, but which we believ'd 
to be a Dunb Man pafs'd by at about two Leagues 
Diftance, fleering for the Coaft of Chinas and in 
the Afternoon went by two Epglijb Ships fieertng' 
the fameCourfe; and thus, we thought, we faw

fions, car'd*not how little we had to do with 
them, yet it was with much Difficulty that we 
kept our felves from being infulted by them feve- 
ral Ways. 

We were in a fmall River of this Country, witli- 
in a few Leagdes of its utmoft Limits North-

the Point of Land, which opens the great Bay

I have obferv'd above, that our Ship fprung 
a Leak at Sea, and that we could not find it out ; 
and however, it happened, that as I ha^ faid it was 
flopped unexpededly in the happy Minqtp of our 
being to be feiz'd by the Dutch and Engltfi 3hips 
in the Bay oiSiami yet as we did not find the 
Ship (o pcrfeftly fit and found as we defir^d, wc 
refolvM, while we were in this Place, to lay her 
on Shore, take out what heavy Things we had on 
Boards which were not many, and to wa(h and 
clean her Bottom, and, if poffible, to find out 
where the Leaks were- , # 

Accordingly, having lightened the Ship, and 
brought all our Guns and other moveable Things 
to one Side, we try'd to bring her down, that 
we might come at her Bottom; but on fecond 
Thoughts we did not care to lay her dry oniGroiind, 
neither could we find out a proper Place for it. 

The Inhabitants, who had never been acquain- 
ted with fuch a Sight, came wondring down to 
the Shore, to look at us; and feeing the Ship lie 
down on one Side in fuch a Manner, and heeling 
in towards the Shore; and not feeing our Men,

who were at Work on her Bottom, with Stage?' 
and with their Boats on the ofrSide, they prefent-r 
iy concluded, that the Ship was caft away, and 
lay fo faft on the Ground'. 

On this Suppofition they came all about us iq 
two or thpee Hours Time, with ten or twelve 
large" Boats, having fomc of them eight, fomc 
ten Men in a Boat, intending, no doubt, to have 
come on Board, and plunder'd the Ship ; and if 
they had found us there, to have carry *d us away 
for Slaves to their King, or whatever they caU 
him } for we knew npthing who was their Go-

When they came up to the Ship, and began to 
row round her, they difcover'd us all hard at Work 
on the Out-fide of the Ship's Bottom and Side, 
waftiing, and graving, and flopping, as every fea* 
faring Man knows hqw. 

They flood fpr a while gazing at us, and we, ^

Avhat their Defign was; but, being wiBing to be

that we were all at Work endeavouring tofave 
her, or to fav^ our Lives by the Help of our Boats,

oumcroQs People, I hare yet to pafs through more 
than rdates to my own Story, and which my Con- 
cern among them will make necedary. I was now, 
as near as I can compute, in the heart of China^ 
, about the Latitude of thirty Itorees North of 
the Line, for we was returned kom^anquin ; I had 
indeed a Mind to fee the Gity oiPddni which I had 
heard fo mqch of, and Father Simon importunM 
. mc daily to do it s at length his Time of going 
. away being fet, and the other Miffionary, who 
was to go with hini, being arriv'd from Maiao^ 
it was neceilacy that we fhould refolve, either to 
; go, or not to go ; fa I referred him to my Partner, 
and left it wholly to his Choice, who at length 
; rcfolv^d it in the AiErmative, and we prepared for 
our Jdurncy. We fet out with very good Adi'an- 
tagc, as. to finding the Way, for we^ot leave to 
travel in the Retinue of onp of their Mandarins 
^ kind of Viceroy or principal Magiftr^tfe in the 
; Provitice where they rc(xde, and who take great 
State upojo them, travelling with great Atten- 
dance, and with great Homage from the t^cop)e> 
who are fometimes greatly impoverifh*d by thcin, 
becaufe all, the Country s they pafs thro* are oblig'd 
to fiimifh ^oviiions for them and alt their At- 
tendance : That which I particularly obferv'd, 
as to our travelling with his Baggage, was this, 
that tho' we received fuflScient ftovifiqns, . both 
for our felyes and our ttorfes, from the Country, 
as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were oblig d 
to pay tor every Thing we had, after the Mar- 
Jcet Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's 
Steward or Commiflary of the Provilions, col- 
leded it duly from us, fo that our travelling in 
the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was isi very 
great Kindnefs to us, was not fuch a mighty Fa- 
vour in him, but was indeed a great; Advantage

to him, conjfidering there were above thirty o^' 
ther Peopie travelled in thie fame Manner bcMesI 
us, under the Protedion of his Retinue, or as 
we may call i?, under his Convoy : This, I fay^ 
was a great Advantage to him. For the Country 
furnifti'd ail the PjrOvifions for nothing, .and he 
took all our .Money for them. 

We were five and twenty Days travelling to 
Peking^ through a Country infinitely populous, but 
mifefably cultivated ; the Husbandry, th<^ Oeco- 
nomy, and the Way of livipg, mifcrablc,^ tha 
they boaft fo much of the In4u(&y of the People » 
I fay, miferable, and fo it is^ if we who undcr- 
ftand how to live were to cindure it, or to com- 
pare it with bur own, but not fo to thefe poor 
Wretches wbb Ipbv^ no othpc : The Pride of thefc 
People is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing 
but their Poverty, which adds to that which! 
call their 'Mifery, and I muil needs think the 
naked Savages .of 4fnericalhc mnch more happy, 
becaufc, as they have nothing, fo they defire 
nothings whereas thefe are ppud and infplent, 
arid in .the main, are nicer Beggars and Drudges ; 
their Oftentation is inexpreflible, and is chiefly 
Ihew'd in their Cloths aid Building, and in the 
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, 
which is to the laft Degree ridiculous, their 
Contempt of all the World but thenifelves. 

I muft confefs, I travellM more pleafantly after- 
wards in the Defarts and vaft Wilderneffes of 
Grand Tartary, than here ; and yet the Roads 
here are welj pav'd, and well kept, and very con- 
venient for Travellers; but nothing was more 
awkward to me, than to fee fuch a haughty, iin- 
perious, infolent People, in the midft of the gref-

knew, that the other Party wa$ fo frighted witk

never made any Attempt upon us.

v^hat we call a broken He^d ; neither did I af* 
tcr wards find any great Inconvenience from the 
Blow, ocher than the Place which w^ashurtian4 
which was well again in two or three Days. 

We made no great Gain however by this Vi- 
dory, for we loft a Camel, and gained a Horfe; 
but that which was remarkable, when we came 
back to the Village, the Man demanded to be 
paid for phc Camel •, I difputcd ft, and it wasr 
brought CO a Hearing before the Chiaefe Judge of 
the Place ; that is to fay, in Englijh^ we went 
before a juftice of the Peace: Give him his due, 
he adcd with a great deal of Prudence and Im- 
partiah'cyi and having heard both Sides he 
gravely ask'd the Chinefe Man, that went with 
me to buy the Camel, whofc Servant he wasj

Stranger-, at whofe Requeft fays the JufticcJ 
At the Stranger's Requeft, fays he : Why then, 
fays the Julricc, you were the Stranger's Ser-

hVcr'd to his Servant, it was deliver'd to him, 
and he <nuft pay for it ? 

Iconfcfs the Thing was fo clear, that I had 
not a Word to fay % but admiring to fee fuch

peared in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond 
the City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers ; how- 
ever, it was carefully done of the Governour, 
and we were very glad to hear we (hould have 
a Guard \ accordingly^ two Days after, we had 
two hundred Soldiers lent us from a Garrifon of 
the Chinefes^on our Left, and three hundred more

In a Word, the Tartars cimc on, and an in-

we could not tel], but ten thoufand we thought

and view'd our Poftute, traverfii^ the Ground 
in the Front of our Line v and'as we found them 
within Gun-(hot, our Leader ordered the two 
Wing^ to advance fwiftly, and give them a Sal- 
vo on each Wing with their Miot, which was 
done, but they went off, and I fuppofc back to

clog'd their Stomach, for they immediately hal-

him ilark naked, and fet him up on the Top of 
the Idol Monfter, and flood all round him, and 
fliot as many Arrows into him as would flick over 
his whole Body, and then they burnt him and all 
the Arrows flicking in him as a Sacrifice to the

Proccffion all over the Country: Well, then, fays 
I> then that Idol ought to be punifc'd fiwrit, and (0 
it flial}, fays I, if I live this Night out. 

In a word, finding me rcfolute, he lik'd the De^

go with me, and bring a ftout Fellow, one of his 
Countrymen to go alfo with us ; and one, fays he, 
as famous for his Zeal as you can defire any one to 
be, againft fuch devilifli Things as thefc. In a 
wwd, be brought me his Comrade, a Scots Man, 
who he called Captain Richardfonj and I gave him 
a full Account of what I had ieen ; and in a word^ 
t>i what I intended ; and he told me readily, he 
would go with me if it coft him his Life ; fo wc 
agreed to go only us three. I had indeed proposed 
it to my Partner, but he declined it ; be faid, hg

Adventure quite out of his Way ; fo, I fay, we

who we were.

bout an Hour after Night we fet out upon our 
Expedition. 

We came to the Place about eleven a Clock at 
Night, and found that the People had not the leaft 
Jealoufy of Danger attending their Idol; the 
Night was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light 
enough to fee that the Iddl flood juft in the fame 
Pofture and Place that it did before : The People 
feem'd to be all at their Reft, only, that in the 
great Hut, or Tent, as we call'd it, where we 
law the three Priefis, who we miftook for Butch- 
ers, we faw a Light, and going up dole to the 
Door, we heard People talking as if there were 
five or fix of them ; we concluded therefore, that if 
we fet the Wild-Fire to the Idol, thefeMen would 
come out immediately, and run up to the Place to 
refGu« it from the Deflrudion that we intended for 
it, and what to do with them we knew not ; once 
we thought of carrying it away and fctting Fire to 
it at a Diftance ; but when we came to handle it, 
we found it too bulky for our Carriage, fo we 
were at a Lofs again : The fccond Scots Man was 
for fetting Fire to the Tent or Hut, and knocking

would be incredible to relate the Particulars of, by 
which Means the Ruffians travel mora in the Winter 
than they can in Summer, bccaufe in thefe Sleds 
they are able to run Night apd Day; the Snow 
being frozen is one univerfal Cdvering to Nature^ 
by which the Hills, the Vales, the Rivers, the 
Lakes, all are fmooth and hard as a Stone, and 
they run upon the Surface without any Regard 
to what is underneath. 

But I had no Occafion to pufli at a Winter 
Journey of this kind : I was bound to Engtandy 
liot td Muj€<ywj and my Rout lay two Ways, 
cither I muft go on as the Caravan went till I

China Cargo to good Advantage, or I muft leave 
the Caravan at a little Town on the Dxvina, from 
whence I had but fix Days by Water to Arch- 
Angely and from thence might be fure of Shipping, 
cither to England^ HoDand, or Hamburgh, 

Now to go any of thefe Journeys in the Winter 
would ha' been prepofterous ; for as to Dantz,ick, the 
Bakick would be frozen up, and I could not get 
Paflage, and to go by Land in thofe Countrys 
was ur lefs fate than among the Mongul Tartars ; 
likewife to go to Arch-Angel in OHobery all the 
Ships would be gone from thence, and even the

South to Mufcow in the Winter wheii the Ships 
are gone; fo that I fhould have nothing but Ex- 
tremity of Cold to encounter, with a Scarcity 
of Provifions, and muft lye there in an empty 
Town all the Winter; fo that upon the whole I

much to do to bear any Qoths on my Back, and 
never made any Fire but without Doors, and for

made me three good Vefts, with large Robes 
or Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, 
and button clofe to the Wrifts, and all thefe liti'd 
with Furs to make them fufficiently warm.' 

As to a warm Houfe, I mufl: confefs I greatly 
diflik'd our Way in England of making Fires 
in every Room in the Houfe, in open Chimneys^ 
which, when the Fire was out, always kept the 
Air in the Room cold ai5 the Climate 2 But taking 
an Apparcment iii a good Houfe in the Town, I 
ordered a Chimney to be built like a Furnace, in

Funnel to carry the Smoke went up one Way, the 
Door to come at the Fire went in another, and 
all the Rooms were kept equally warm, but no 
Fire feen, juft as they heat the Bagnios in Eng-^

Cdnfideration had made him look into himfelf, as

found the Mind of Man, if it was but once brought

how little this World was concerned in its true 
Fdicity, was perfeftly capable of making a Feli-

the Authority, the Riches, and the Pleafures 
which fome enjoy*d in the World, and which he 
had enjoyM his Share of^ had much in them that 
was agreeable to us, yet he obferv'd that all thofc 
Things chiefly gratify'd the coarfcfl of our Aftc-

our Avarice, our Vanity, and our Sehfuality; all 
which were indeed the meet Frodud of the/s^orft
