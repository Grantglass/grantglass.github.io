I BODINSON'S FAMILY, ETCr-EIS [LOPI'JCENT FROM HIS PARENTS.

I was born in the year 1&2, in the city of
York, of a good family, though not of that
country, my father being a foreigner of Bra
men, named Kreutznaer, who settled first at
Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise,
and leaving ofl' his trade, lived afterwards at
York; from whence he had married my mother,
whose relations were named Robinson, a very
good family in that country, and after whom I
was so called, that in to say, Robinson Kreut-
znaer; but, by the usual corruption of words
in England, we are now called, nay, ween."
ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and
so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was
lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of
foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the
famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at
the bottle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.
What became of my second brother, I never
knew, any more than my father and mother
did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not
bred to any trade, my head began to be titled
very early with rambling thoughts. My father,

who was very aged, had given me a competent
shore of learning, as far as house education
and a country freeechord generally go, and
designed me for the law; but I would he satis-
fied with nothing but going to sea: and my
inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the command of my Gather, and
against all the ontrcatiea and persuasion: of
my mother and other friends, that there seemed
to be something fatal in that propension of
nature, tending directly to the life of misery
which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me
serious and excellent counsel against what he
foresaw was my design. He called me one
morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined by the gout, and expoatulated very warn-y
with me upon this aubjeet: he wired me what
reams, more than a. mere wandering melt-
nation, 1 had for leaving his house, and my
native country, where I might be well INN-
duced, and had aproapeet of raising my foo
tune, by application and industry, full! I life
of ease and pleasure. He told me it waa men
of desperate forttmen, on one hand, or of aupo

These wise and sober thoughts continued
dwing the storm, and indeed some time after;
but the next day, as the wind was abatedfind
theseacalmeeregantobea littleinurodto
it. However, Iwas very greve that day, being
also a little seasick still: but towards night
the weather cleared up, the wind wasquite
over, and a charming fine evening fillowed;
the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so
the next morning; and havinglittle or no wind,
and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the
sight was, as I thought, tho most. delightful thnt
I ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now
no more seasick, but very cheerful, looking
with wonder upon the sea thatwas so rough
and terrible the day before, and could be so
calm and p'leasant m a little time afier.

And now, lest my good resolutions ehould
continue, my companion, who had indeed en-
ticed me away, came to me, and said, Well,
Bob, clapping me on the shoulder, how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frightened,
wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a cop-

thenestwastobesnchaoneas theworss
and most hardened wretch among us would
confetnboth thedangerand thomorcyol'.
The sixth dayot' our being at sea, we came
into Yumouth roads; the wind having been
ccntrnry, and the weather calm, we had made
but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we
lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz. at south-
west, for seven or eight days, during which
time a great many shipsfrorn Newcastle came
into the some roads, as the common harbour
where the ships might wait for a wind {or the
river Thames. "/6 had not, however, rid
here so long, but we should hnve tided up the
river, but that the wind blew too flesh; and,
alter we had lain four or five days, blew very
hard. However, the roads being reckoned as

goodasaharhotn', thoanchoragegcod,and

ourground tackle very strong, our men were
mortcerned, and not in the least apprehen-

sive of danger, butspent the time in rest and
mirth, alter the manner of the see. But the
eighth day, in the morning, the wind increa-
sed, andwe had all hands at work to strike
ourtopmasts,andmake everything snugand
close, thattheship might ride as easy as pos-
sible. By noon the sea went very high in-
deed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped
several seas,and we t, once or twice,
our anchor had come home; upon whichotn'

thatthis would be nothing too, like the first:
but when the master himselfeame by me, as I
said just new, and said we should be all lost, I
was dreadfully frightened. I got up out of my
cabin, and loo'ed out; but such a dismal sight
I never saw; the sea went mountains high,
and broke upon us every threoor four minutes.
\Vhen I could loolt about, I could see nothing
but distress around us; two ships, that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the
board, being deeply laden; and our men cried
out that I ship, which rid about a mile ahead
of us, was foundered. Twomore ships, being
driven from their anchors, were run out of the
roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with
not a mast standing. The light ships fared
the best, as not so much labouring in the seat;
but two or three of them drove, and Crime
close by us, running away, with only their
spriuails out, before the wind. Toward
evening, the mate and hoatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the
foreman, which he was very loath to do; but
the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, ho consented;
and when they had cut away the foremost, the
mainrnast stood so loose, and shook the ship
an much, they were obliged to cut it away also,
and make a clear deck.

Any one mayjudge what a condition I
must be in at all this, who was but a young
sailor, and who had been in such a fright be-
fore at but a. little. But if t cancxpvcss, at
this distance, the thoughts I had about me at
that time, I was in tenfold more hotroroftnind
upon want of my former convictions, and
the having returned from them to the resolu-
tions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was
at death itself; and these, added to the terror
of the storm, put me into such a condition,
that I eon by no words describe it, but the
worst was not come yet; the storm continued
with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never known a worse.
We had a good ship, but she was deep laden,
and so wallowed in the sea, that the seamen
every now and then cried out, she would
founder. It was my advantage, in one re-
spect, that I did not know what they meant
by founder, till I inquired. However, the
storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not
often seen, the master, the boeuwain, and
some others, more sensible than the rest, at
their prayers, and expecting every moment the
ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of
the night, and under all the rest. C' "II' dis-
houses, one of the men, that had been down
on purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung a.

leak; another said, there was four feet water
in the hold. Then all hands were called b
the pump. At that very word, my heart, as I
thought, died within me; and I fell backwads
upon the side of my bed, where I sat in the
cabin. However, the men roused me, and
told me, that I, who was able to do nothing
before, was as well able to pump as another:
at which I stirred up and went to the pump,
and worked very heartily. "'hile this was
doing, the master seeing some light colliers
who, not able to ride out the storm, were
obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would
not come near us, ordered us to fire I gun, as
a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing
what that meant, was so surprised, that I
thought the ship had broke, or some dreadful
thing had happened. in a word, I was so sur-
prised, that [fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when every body had his own life
to think of, mono minded me, or what was
become of me: but another man stepped up
to the pump, and tltrtlstinz me aside with his
foot, let the lie, thinking i had been dead; and
it was a great while before I came to myself:
'We worked on; but the water increasing In
the hold, it was apparent that the ship would
founder; and though the storm began to abate
a little, yet as it was not possible she could
swim till we might run into n port, so the
master continued firing guns for help; and a
light ship, who had rid it out just ahead ofus,
venturch boat out to help us. It was with
the utmost hnvnrd the boat came near us, but
it was impossible for us to gel on board, or for
the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last
the men rowing very heartily, and venturing
their lives to save ours, our men cast them a
rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then
veered it out a great length, Which they, after
great labour and hazard, tools hold of, and we
hauled them close under our stern, and got all
into their boat. It was In no for them
or us, after we were in the best, to think of
reaching their own ship; so all to let
her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore

In this state of life, however, I remained
Iometime, uncertain what measures to take,
and what course of life to lead. An irresisti-
ble reluctance continued to going home; and as
I stayed awhile, the remembrance of thedistress
I had been in wore off; and, as that abated,
the little motion I had in my desires to a return
wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thou ts of it, and looked out for a voyage.
That ev' influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, thathurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my foo-
tune, and that imp ressed those commits so for-
cibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good
advice, and to the enlreaties, and even the com
mands of my father; I say, the same influence,
whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate
of all enterprises to my view; and I went on
board avemelbound tothe coastofAfrica ; or,as
our sailors vulgarlycall it, a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune, that in all these
adventures I -did not ship myself as a sailor;
whereby, though I might indeed have worked
a little harder than ordinary, yet, at the same
time, I had learned the dutyand otfice of a
forentastrman, and in time might have quali-
fied myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not a
master: but asit was always my fate to choose
for the worse, so I did here; for having money
in my pocket, and good clothes upon-my back,
I would always go on board in the habit of a
gentlemen; and so I neither had any business
in the ship, nor learned to do any. It. was my
lot, first of all to fall mto pretty good company
in London; which does not always happen to
such loose and misguided young fellows as I
then was, the devil, generally, not omitting to
lay some snare for them very early. But it
was not so with me: I first fell acquainted
with the master of a ship, who had been on
the ooastof Guinea,and who, having had very

good succem there, was molvedto go again.
He, taking a fancy to my conversation, which
was not atalldisagroeableatthat time, and

hearing me say I had a. mind tosses the world,
told me, that if I would go the voyage with
him, I should be at no expense; I 'should be
his messmate and his- companion; and if I
could carry any thing with me, I should have
all the advantage of it than the trade would
admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement. I embraced the offer, and,
entering into a strict friendship with this
captain, who was an honest and plaindealing
man, I went the voyage with him, and carried
a small adventure with me; which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain,
I increased very considerably; for I carried
about forty pounds in such toys and (rifles as
the captain directed me to buy. This forty
pounds I had mustered together by the assist.
ance of some of my relations whom I corro-
sponded with ; and who, I believe, got my father
or, at least, my mother, to contribute so much
as that to my first adventure. This was the
only voyage which I may say was successful
in all my adventures, and which I owe to the
integrity and honeston my friend the captain;
under whom also I got a competent knowledge
of the mathematics and the rules of navigation,
leaned how to keep an accent of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in- short, to
understand some things that were needful to be
understood by a sailor: liar, as he took delight
to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in
a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and
a merchant: for I brought home five pounds
nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost three hundred pounds, and this filled me
with those aspiring thoughts which have since
so completed my ruin. Yet even in this voy-
age I had my misfortunes too; particularly,
that I was continually sick, be tag-thrown into
a violent calenture by the excessive he'flof

the climate; our pnncpaltrad beingupon

the coast, from the latitude of fifteen- degree:

north, even to the line itself.

SECTION Ill.

IOBLKSON'S CAPTIVI'I'Y A'I' SALLiD--ESCAPE WITH IURY--ABRIVAL AT THE
BRAZILS-

Iwasnowsetnpfora Guinea trader; and
my fiiend, to my greatmist'ortune, dyingsoon
alter his arrival, I resolved logo the same
voyage again; and I embarked in the same
veaselwithone who was his mateintheforh

 

mer voyage, and had now got the command
of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made- lbr thoughIdid notarry
quite a hundred s of my new-gfined

wealth, so that I had two hundred pounds left,

on
and which I lodged with my friend's widow,
who was very just to me, yet I fell intoterrihle
mislbrtunee in this voyage . and the first was
this, viz.--0ur ship, making her course to-
wards the Canary Islands, or rather between
those islands and the African shore, was sun
prised. in the gray ofthe morning, bya Turk-
ish rover, of Sallee, who gave chase to us
with all the sail she could make. We crowd-
ed also as much canvass as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to get clear; but
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would
certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to light, our ship having twelve guns,
and the rover eighteen. About three in the
afternoon he came up with us; and bringing
to, by mistake, jutathwart our quarter, instead
ofathwart our stern, as he intended, we brought
eight ot'our guns to bear on that side, and
poured in abroadside upon him, which made
him eheerofl' again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot from near
two hundred men which he had on board.
However, we had not a man touched, all our
men keeping close. I-Ic prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but
laying us on board the next time upon our other
quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks,
who immediately fell to cutting and hacking
the sails and rigging. 1V0 plied them with
small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such
like, and cleared our deck of them twice.
However, to cut short this melancholy part of
our story, our ship being disabled, and three
of our men killed and eight wounded, we
were obliged to yield,'and were carried all
prisoners into Sallec, a part. belonging to the
Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful
u at first I-apprehended; nor was I carried
up the country to the emperor's court, as the
rest of our men were, but was kept by the cap-
tain ofthe rover as his proper prize, and made
his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for
his business. At this surprisingchange of my
circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now
looked back upon my father's prophetic dis.
course to me, that I should be miserable, and
have none to relieve me; which I th ht was

now so efi'ectually brought to pass, that it could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven
had overtaken me, and I was undone, without
redemption. But, alu! this was but a taste

ofthe misorwaaatogothrough, aswillap-
the

 

would take me with him when he went to II
again, believing that it would, some time or
other, be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or
Portuguese man of war, and that then I should
be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon taken away; for when he went to see, he
left me on shore, to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery of slaves about
his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin, to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape,
and what method I might take to reflect it, but
found no way that had the least probability in
it. Nothing presenled to make the supposi-
tion of it rational; for I had nobody to com-
municate it to that would embark with me;
no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or
Scotchman there but myself; so that for two
years, though I oflen pleased myselfwilh the
imagination, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it in pmtice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance
presented itself, which put the old thought of
making some attempt for my liberty again in
my head. My patron lying at home longer
than usual, without fitting out his ship, which,
as I heard, was tbr want of money, he used
constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes
oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the
ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fish-
ing; and as he always took me and a young
Morocco with him to row the boat, we made
him very merry, and I proved very dexteroua
in catching fish, insomuch that sometimes he
would send me with a Moor, one of his kine-
men, and the youth, the Moresco, as they
filled him, to catch a dish of fish tor him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing
in a stark calm morning. a fog rose so thick,
that though we were not halfa league from the
shore, we lost eight of It, ' and rowing, he
knew not whither, or which way, we laboured
all day and all the next night, and when the
morning came, we found we had pulled off to
sea, instead of pulling infbrlhe shore, and that
we were at least two leagues from the shore:
however, we got well in again, though with a
great deal of labour, and some danger, for the
wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morn-
ing . but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster,
resolved to take more care of htmelf for the
future; and having lying by him the |
of our English ship he had taken, be resolved
he would notgo afiehinganymore without a
compose and some provision, on he ordered

reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stepped into the
cabin, and fetching one of the fowling pieces,
I presented it at him, and told him, I had
done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet,
I would do him none: But, said I, you swim
well enoughto reach the shore, and the sea'is
calm: make the best of your way to shore,
andeiIl doyouno harm: but ifyou come

head; for [em resolved to have my liberty.
So he turned himself about, and swam for the
shore; and I make nodoubtbuthereadted it
with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this
Moor with me and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to trust him. When
he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they
filled Xury, and said to him, Xury, ifyou
will be faithful to me I will mslte you a great
man; butit'you will notstrokeyourface tobe
true to me, (that is, swear by Mahcmet and
his father's hearth) I must throw you into the
sea too. The boy smiled in my face, and
spoke so innocently, that I could not mistmst
him; andswnre to be faithful to me, and go
all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was
swimming, I stood out directly to sea with the
boat, rather stretching to windward, that they
might think me gone towards the Strait's mouth,
(as indeed any one that had been in their wits
must have been supposed to do ;) for who
would have supposed we were sailing on to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where
whole nstionsof negrces were sure tosurround
with their canoes, and destroy us; where
we could never once go on shore butwe should
he devoured by savage beasts, or more merci-
less savages of human kind '!

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening,
I changed my course, and steered directly
south end by east, bending my course a little
toward the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair flesh gale of wind,
and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that
I believe by the next day, at three o'clock in the
afiernoon, when I made the land, I could not
be less than one hundred and filly miles south
of Sallee, quits beyond the Emperor of Mo-
locco's dominions, or indeed ofany other king
thereahout: for we esw no people.

ing to the southward, I concluded also that if
any efourveaaelswereinchue ofme,they
alsowould now give over: so I ventured to
make to thecoast, and came toananchorin
the mouth ofalittleriver; I knewnotwhator
where, neither what latitude, whst country,
what nation, or what river. I neither saw,
nordesired to see, any people; the principal
thing Iwentedwas fresh water. Wecsms
into this creek in the evening, resolving to
swimonshore as soon as itwas dark, and
discover thecountry:but as soon as itwas
quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of
the barking, rearing, and howling of wild crea-
tures, of we know not what kinds, thatthepoor
boy wu candy to die with fear, and begged
oftne not togo on Ithore till day. Well,
Xury, said I, then I will not; but it my
be we may see men by day, who will be as
had to us as those lions.--Then we may give
them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing;
make them run away. Such English Xury
spoke hy conversing among us slaves. How
ever, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful,snd
I gave him a dram out ofour patron's case of
bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury's
advice was good, and I took it. "'e dropped
our little anchor, and lay still all night: I say,
still, for we slept none; for in two or three
hours we saw vast creatures (we knew not
what tocsll them) of many sorts, come down
to the seashore, and run into the wster, wal-
lowing snd washing themselves, for the pleasure
ofcooling themselves; end they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never
indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed
sowasltoo; but we were both morefrightp
cried when we heard oneof these mighty crea-
tures swimming towards our boat: we could
not see him, but we might hear him, by his
blowing, to be a monstrous, huge, and furious
bout. Xury said it was 3 lion, and it might
best), for aughtI know; hutpoorth-ycried
to me to weigh the anchor, and row away.
No, says I, Xury; we can slip our cable with
sbueytoit,andgoofi'tosea:theycannotfol-
lowusfar. I hadnc sooner said so, but!
perceived the creature (whatever it was) within
two oars length, which something surprised
me; however, 1 immediately stepped to the
cabin door, end, taking up my gun, fired at
him; upon which he immediately turned about,
and swam to the shore again.

then I loaded another gun with two bullets:
and I third, for we had three pieces, I loaded

up the second piece immediately, and though
behegnntomoveoti', firedsptnmndshot him
in the head, and had the pleasure to see him

gling for life. Then Xury wok heart, and
would have me let him go on shore. Well,
go, said I: so the boy jumped into the wItnr,

shore with the other hand, and coming close
to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to
his ear, and shot him' In the heed Iglin, which

This wasgamc, indeed, tous, but itwas no

charges of powderand shot upon I creature
that was good for nothing to us. However,
me ind he would have some of him; so he
comes on board, and asked me to give him the
hatchet: For what, Xury? said I. Me cut
off his bend, said he. However, Xury could
not cut ofl' his head; but he cut off I foot. and
brought it with him, and it was It monstrous

one. I bcthought myself, however, thIt

perhaps the skin of him might, one wsy or
other, he of tomovalue tons; and I resolved
to lake of his skin, if Icould. So Xury and
I went to work with him: but Xury was much
the better workman It it, for I knew very ill
bowtodo it. Indeed, it took us both up the
whole day; but Itlast we got otl' the hide of
him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin,
the sun efi'ectually dried it in two days' time,
Ind it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop we made onto the southward
continually, for ten or twelve days, living very
sparingly on our provisions, which began to
abate very much, and going noot'tener into the
shore than we were obliged to for fresh water.
My design in this, was to make the river

When I had pursued this resolution Ibont
tendnys bnger,thavo said, Ibegantosee
thatthe land was inhebitod;and intwo or
three plsces, as we sailed by, we saw people
standupon theshore tolook It us: wecould
also perceive they were quite blank, and stark
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on
shoretothetn; but Xury was my beuercoun-
seller, and said to me, No go, no go. How-
ever, I hauled in neIrer the shore,that I might
talk to them; Ind I lbund they ran along the
shore by me 5 good wey. I observed they
had no weapons in their hands, except one,
who had I. long, slender stick, which Xury
said was I lance, and that they would throw
them agreotway withgoodaim; so Ikeptat
a distance, but talked to them by ysigns,ns
well as I could, and particulIrly made signs
for something to eat. They beckoned to me
to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some
meat: upon this, I lowered the top of my sail,
and lay by, and two ot'IhenI ranup into the
country; and inlessthan hall'anhour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh and some corn, such as is the pro-
duce of their country; but we neither knew
what the one or the other was; however, we
were willing to accept it. But how to come
at it was our next dispute, for I was not for
venturing on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid ofus: but they took a safe way
forusall, t'orthey brought ittotheshore, Ind
laid itdown, and wentsnd stood l. great way
08' till we fetched it on board, and then eIme
close to us again.

We made signs ofthanlrs to them, for we
had nothing to make them amends: but an
opportunity naefl'ered that very instant to oblige
them wonderfitlly; for while we were lying by
the shore, came two mighty creatures. one
pursuing the other (as we took it) with great
fury, from the mountains towards the sen.
whether it was the male pursuing thc female,
or whether they were in sport or in n,.e, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell
whether" It was usual or ;but I believe
it wns the latter, because, in the first place,
those ravenous creatures seldom but in
Ihanight: and, in the second place, we found
the people terribly frightened, especially the
women. The man that had the lance, ordart,
did not fly from them, but the rest did; how-
ever,as the two creatures ran directly into the
water, they did not seem to ofl'er to fall upon
any of the negroes, but plunged themsclm
into the sea, and awarn about, as if they had
come for their diversion: at last, one of them
began to come nearer our boat than I at first
expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition,
and bade Xury load both the others. As
soon as he came fairly within my reach, I
fired, and shot him directly in the head : im-
mediotcly he sunk down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as it'
he was struggling for life, and so indeed he
was: he immediately made to the shore; but
between the wound, which was his mortal
hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to erpreu the astonishment
of these poor creaturegat the noise and fire of
my gun ; some of them were even readytodie
1hr fear, and fell down as dead with the very
terror; but when they saw the creature dead,
and sunk in the water, and that I made signs
to them to come to the shore, they took heart
and came to the shore, and began to search tbr
theerealure. I found him by his blood stain-
ing the water; and by the help of arope, which
I shut; round him, and gave the negroea to
rant, they dragged him on shore, and found
that it was a most curious leopard, spotted,
and line toan admirable degree; and the ne-
groes held up their hands with admiration, to
think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature,frightened with the flash
of fire and the noiseof the gun, swam on shore,
and ran up directly to the mountains from
whence they came; nor could I, at that dis-
tance,th what it was. I found quickly the
negroes were for eating the flesh of this crea-
ture, so I was willing to have them take it as
a favour from me; which, when I made signs
to them that they might take him, they were
very thankful fir. Immediately they fell to
work with him; and though they had no knife,
yet, with'a sharpened piece of wood, they took
of his skin as readily, andth more readily,
than we could have done with a knife. They
offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them, but. made
signs for the skin, which they ave me very
[reely,and brought me a 'deal more of
their provisions, which, though I did not un-
derstand, yet I accepted. I then made signs
Iothem for some water, and held out one of
my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to

13

show that it was empty, and that I wanted to
have it filled. They called immediately to
some of their li'iends, and there came two
women, and b ht a great vessel made of
earth, and humt, as I suppose, inthe sun; this
they set down to me, as before, and I sent
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all three. The women were as' stark naked
as the men.

I was new furnished with roots and corn,
such as it was, and water; and leaving rn .
friendly negroes, I made forward for about
eleven days more, without offering to go near
the shore, till I saw the land run out a great
length into the sea, at about the distance of
four or five leagues before me; and the sea
being very calm,I kept a large offing, to make
this point. At length, doublin the point, at
about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly
land on the other side, to seaward: then I
concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Cape do Verd, and those the
islands, called, from thence, Cape dc Vcrd
Islands. However, they were at a. great dis-
tance, and I could not well tell what I hadbest
to do; for if I should be taken with a gale of
wind, I might neither reach one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I
stepped into the cabin, and eat me down, Xury
having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy
cried out, Master, master, a ship with a sail!
and the foolish boy was frightened out of his
wits, thinking it. must needs be some of his
mastet's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew
we were gotten far enough out of theirreach.
[jumped out of the cabin, and immediately
saw, not only the ship, but what she was, viz.
that it was aPortuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for negroes.
But, when I observed the course she steered,
I was soon convinced they were'bound some
other way, and did not design to come any
nearer to the shore: upon which, I stretched
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to
speak with them, if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I
should not be able to come in their way, but
that they would be gone by before I could make
any signal to them; but afler I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it
seems, saw me, by the help of their perspec-
tive glasses, and that it was some European
boat, which, they supposed, must belong to
comeship thatwas lost; so theyshertened sail,
to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my patron's ensign on board,
I made a wat'l of it to them, for a signal of
dism,andfiredagun,bothwhichtheysaw-,14

RI! they told me they saw the smoke, though
they did not hear the gun. Upon these sig-
nals, they very kindly brought to, and lay by
for me; and in about three hours' time I came
up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese,
and in Spanish and in French, but I understood
none of them; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who
was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that
I had made my escape out of slavery from the
Moors, at Sallee: they then bade me come on
board, and very kindly took me in, and all my
goods.

It was an inexpressihle joy to me, which any
one will believe, that I was thus delivered, as
I esteemed it, from such a miserable,and almost
hopeless condition as I was in; and l imme-

diately ofl'ered all I had to the captain of the
ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he
generously told me, he would take nothing from
me, but that all I had should be delivered safe
to me, when I came to the Brazils. For, says
he, I have saved your life on no other terms
than I would be glad to be saved myself; and
it may, one time or other, he my lot to be taken
up in the same condition. Besides, said he,
when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a
way from your own country, if I should take
from you what you have, you will he starved
there, and then I only take away tltat life I
have given. No, no, Senhor Inglee, (Mr.
Englishman,) says he; I will carry you thither
in charity, and these things will help to buy
your subsistence and your passage home there

again.

 

SECTION IV.

an SETTLES IN THE BRAZILS AS A PLANTER.--Mm3 ANOTHER VOYAGE,
AND IS SHIP'VRECKED-

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he
wasjust in the performance, to atittlo; for he
ordered the seamen, that none sltould ofl'er to
touch any thing I had: then he took every thing
into his own possession, and gave me back
an exact inventory of them, that I might have
them. even so much as my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and
that he saw, and told me he would buy it of me
for the ship's use; and asked me what I
would have for it 'I I told him, he had been so
generous to me in every thing, that I could
not ofl'er to make any price of the boat, but
left it entirely to him: upon which he told me
he would give men note of hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and
when it came there, if any one offered to give
more, he would make it up. He offered me
also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy
Xury, whichI was loath to take; not that I
was not willing to let the captain have him, but
I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty,
who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring
my own. However, when I let him know my
reason, he owned it to hejust,nnd ofi'ered me
this medium, that he would give the boy an
obligation to set him free in ten years, if he
'urncd Christian : upon this, and Xury saying
he was willing to go to him, I let the captain
have him.

\Ve had a very good voyage to the Brazils,
and arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos,
or All Snints' Bay, in about twenty-two days
after. And now lwas once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of
life; and what to do next with myself, I was
now to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave
me, I can never enough remember: he would
take nothingof me for my passage, gave me
twenty ducals for the leopard's skin, and forty
for the lion's skin, which! had in my boat,
and caused every thing I had in'the ship
to be punctually delivered to me; and what
I was willing to sell, he bought of me; such
as the me of bottles, two of my guns, and a
piece of the lump of hecs-wax,--for I had
made candles of the rest: in a word,I made
about two hundred and twenty pieces deight
ofallmycargo: and with this stock, [went
on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, beforeI was re-
commendedto the house ofo good honest
man, like himself; whohad an ingenious they
call it, (that is, a plantation and a sugar-
hoose.) I lived with him some time, and ae-
quainted myself, by that means, with the
manner of plantingand ofmaking sugar: and
seeing how well the planters lived,.and how
they got rich mddealy, I received, if [could
get a licence to settle there, I would turn
planter among them: endeavouring, in the
mean time, to find out someway to get my
money, which I had tell in London, remit-
ted to me. To this purpose, getting a ltind of
a letter efnatunlization, I purchased as much
land that was uncured as my money would
reach, and formed a plan fir my plantation
and settlement; such a one as might be suit-
able to the stock which I proposed to myself
to receive from England. .

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon,
but born of English parents, whose name was
Wells, and in much such circumstances as I
was. I call him my neighbour, because his
plantation lay neat to mine, and we wenton
very aociahly together. My stock was but
low, as well as his; and we rather planted for
food than any thing else, {hr about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land
began toeome intoorder; so thatthetbird
year we planted some tobacco, and made each
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canesin theyear to come: but webothwant-
ed help; and now I found, more thanbefore, I
had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never
did right, was no great wonder. I had no
remedy, butto goon: I had got into attent-
ploymcnt quits remote to my genius, and di-
rectly contrary to the lifeI delighted in, and
tbr which I forsoolt my father's home, and
broke through all his good advice: nay,I
was coming into the very middle station,or
upper degree of low life, which my father
advised me to before; and which, If I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have stayed at
home, and never have fatigued myself in the
world,asl haddone: andIusedotten tosay
to myself, I could have done this as well in
England, among my friends, as have gone five
thousand miles 06' to do it among strangers
and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a
distanceas nevertn hearti'ornanypartefthe
world tint had the leut knowledge ofme.

Inthismanner, [used tolooltuponmycon-
dition with the utmost regret. I had nobody
toconverso with, but newand then this neigh-
bour; no work to bedone, but by the labour
ofrny hands: andIused tosay, I lived just
like a man cut away some desolate island,
that ludnohedy there but himself: But how

the truly solitary life I reflected on, 'm anisland
ofmero desolation, should be my lot, who had
so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led,' in which, had I continued, I had,
in all probability, been exceeding preoperat-
artd rich

I was, in some degree, settled in my mea-
sures for carrying on the plantation, beibre my
kind friend, the captain of the ship that took
me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained
there, in providing his lading, andP preparing
for it's voyage, near three months: when, tel-
ling him what little stock I had left behind me
in London, he gave me this friendly and sin-
cere advice: Senltor Inglez, says be, (for so
he always called me,) if you will give me let-
ters, and a precuration here tn form to me,
with orders to the person who has your money
in London, to send your efl'ects to yI.ishen,m
suchpersonsas Iahall direct, andin such
goods as are proper for this cotmtry, I will
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at
my return: but, since human afl'airs are all
subject to changes and disasters, I would have
you give orders for but one hundred pounds
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock,
andletthehuard berun for the first,so that
if it come sale, you may order the rest the
some way; and, it' it miscarry, you may have
the other half to have recourse to for your sup-
ply. This was so wholesome advice, and
looked so friendly, that I could not but be con-
vincedit wasthe bestcotnse Icouldtalte; so
I accordingly prepared letters to the gentle-
woman with whomI lea my money, and a
procuratioa to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired the.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full
account of all my adventures; my slavery, es-
cape, and how I had met with the Portuguese
captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour,
and what condition I was now in, with all other
nee directionstbrrnysupply; and when

there, to send over, not the order only, but a

Ithoughtmy fortunemade,forl wassurprised
with the joy ofit; and my good steward, the
captain, had laid out the five pounds, which
my friend hadaent him see. present for him-
self, to purchase and bri me over a servant,
- under bond for six ye service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little
tobacco, which I would have him accept, being
of my own produce. Neither was this all: but
my goods being all English manufactures, such
aseloths, stutl's, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found
means to sell them to a very great advantage;
so that I might say, I had more than four times
the value of my first cargo, and was now infi-
nitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancementofmy plantation: for the first thing
I did, I boughtme a negro slave, and a Euro-
pean servant also ; I mean another besides that
which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made
the very means of our adversity, so was itwith
Inc. I went on the next year with great suc-
cess in my plantation ; I raised fifty great rolb
oftobacoo on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neigh-
bours: and these filly rolls, beingeach of above
one hundred weight, were well cured,
and laid by against the return of the fleet from
Lisbon: and now, increasing in business and
in wealth, my head began to be full ofprojecta
and undertakings beyond my reach; such as
are, indeed, otiert the ruin of the best heads
in business. Had I continued in the station

things to have yet befallcn me, for which my
father so earnestly recommended a quiet, re-
tired life, and which he had so sensibly de-
scribed the middle station of life to be full of :
but other things attended me, and I was still
to he the wilful agent ofall my own miseries;
and, particularly, to increase my fault, and
double the reflections upon myself, which in
my future sorrows I should have leisure to
make, all these miscarriageswere procured by
my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish
inclination, of wandering about, and pruning

To come, lhen,'by justdegreea, to the pars
tic-hrs of this part of my story.---'Iou may
suppose, that having now lived almost tour
years in the Emails, and beginning 'to thrive
and prosper very well upon my plantation, I
had not only learned the language, but had

contracted an acquaintance and friendship .

among my fellow-planters, as well as

the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our
port; andthat,inmydiscourses antengthem,
I had frequently given them an account of my
two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the man-
ner of trading with the negroes there, and how
easy itwastopurchaseonthocoast fortrifleo--
such as beads, toys, knives, scisors, batchets,
bits ofglase, and the like--not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, Etc. but no-
groes, for the service ofthe Brazila, in great
numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my
discourses on these heads, but especially tothat
part which related to the buying negroes;
which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carriedonbythea-'m,orpermissiooofthe
kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed
from the public; so that few negrocs were
bought, and those excessive dear.

part of the stock.

This won a fair proposal, it must be con-
fessed, had it been made to any one that had
not a settlement and plantation of his own to
look atler, which was in a fair way of coming
to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, thatwas thus entered
end established, and had nothing to do but go
on as I had begun, for three or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred
pounds from England: and who, in that time
and with that little addition, could scarce have
failed of being worth three or four thousand
pounds sterling, and that increasing too: for
me to think of such avoyage, was the most
preposterous thing that ever man, in such cir-
cumstances, could be guilty all

But I, that was born to be my own de-
stroyer, could no more resist the offer, than I
could restrain my first rambling designs, when
my sther' I good counsel was lost upon me. In
a word, I told them I would go with all my
heart, ifthey would undertake to loolt after my
plantation in my absence, and would d'upose of
it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried
This they all engaged to do, and entered into

writings or covenams to do so; and I made a_

fimnal will, disposing of my plantation and ef-
fects, in case of my death, mating the captain
of the ship, that had saved my life, as before,
my universal heir; but obliging' him to dispose
of my efl'eetsas I had directed' In my will , one
halfof the produce being to himself, and the
other to be shipped to England.

In short, I took all ble caution to pre-
mrve my efl'ects, and to keep up my plantation:
hadI used halfas much prudence to have look-
ed into my own inure", and have made a judg-
ment of what I ought to have done and not to
have done, I had certainly never gone away

therefore resolved to stand away for Barba-
does; which by keeping off to sea, to avoid
the iitdraught of the bay or gulf of Mexico,
we might easily perform, as we hoped, in
about fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not
possibly make our voyage to the coast of
Africa without some assistance, both to our
ship and ourselves.

\Vith this design, we changed our course,
and steered away; N. \V. by SW. in order to
reach some of our English islands, where I
bolted for relief: but our voyage was otherwise
determined; for being in the latitude of twelve
degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came
upon us, which carried us away with the same
intpeluosity westward, and drove us so out of
the very way of all human commerce, that had
ail our lives been saved, as to the sen, we were
rather in dangcr of being devoured by savages
than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very
hard, one of our men early in the morning,
cried out, Land' and we had no sooner run
out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship
struck upon It sand, and in a moment, lIcr mo-
tion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all
have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close quaners, to shelter
usfrom the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been
in the liltc condition, to describe 'or conceive
the consternation of men in such circumstances :
we knew nothing where we were, or upon what
land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inha-
bited; and as the rage of the wind was still
great, though rather less than at first, we could
not so much ashope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the
wind, by a kind of miracle should imme-
diately turn about. In a word, we sat looking
upon one another, and expecting death every
moment, and every man acting accordingly,aa
preparing for another world; for there was
little or nothing ntore for us to do' In this: that
which was our present comfort, and all the
comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our ex-
pectation, the ship did not break yet, and that
the master said thpa wind began to yabate.

NoW. though we thought that the wind did a
little abate, yet the ship having thus struck
upon the sand, and sticking too fat for In to
expect her getting of, we were in a dreadful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to
think of saving our lives as tvcll an we could.
We had a boat at our stern just before the

storm, but she was first slaved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and, in the next
place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was
driven off to sea; sothere wu no hope from
her: we had another boaton board, but how
to get her ofl" Hill) the sea was a doubtful thing,
however, there was no room to debate, for we
fancied the ship would break" In pieces every
minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already

In this distress, the mateof our vessel laid
hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest
of the men, they got her flung over the ship's
side : and getting all into lter, let her go, and
committed ourseltes, being eleven' In number,
to God's mercy, and the wild sea: for though
the storm was abated considerably, vet the sea
went dreadful high upon the them, and might
be well called den wild see, as the Dutch call
the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed;
for we all saw plainly, that the sea went so
high, that the boat could not live, and that we
should be inevitably drowned. As to making
sail, we had none; nor, if we had could we
have done any thing with it; so we wutkcd at
the car towards the land, though with heavy
hearts, like men going to cxccution (hr we all
knew that when the boat came nearer to the
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However,
we committed our souls to God in the most
earnest manner; and the wind driving us to-
wards the shore, we hastened our destruction
with our own hands, pulling as well as we
could towards land.

"'hat the shore was--whether rock or sand,
whether steep or shoal--We knew not; the
only hope that could rationally give us the
least shadow of expection, was, if we might
happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of
some river, where by great chance we might
have run our boat' In, or got under the lee of the
land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; and as
we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land
looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about
aleagueand a half, as we reckoned it, a rag-
ing wave, mountainlike, came rolling astern
of us,and plainly bade usexpect the coup de
grace. to a word, it took us with such a fury,
that it ovcnet the boat at once; and separa-
ting us, aswell from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to any, "0
God i" for we were all swallowed up in a mo
ment.

Nothing can describe the can't-ion o!
thought which I felt, when' I Iunk into the
water; fir though I am very well, yet I
could not deliver myself from the woven no no
to draw my breath, till that wove having driven
me, or rnther carried me, a. vast way on to-
wards the shore, Ind hnving spent itself, went
back, end lefi me upon the land almost dry,

so much nee of mind, aswell no breath

than I expected, I got upon my feet, and em

it wuimpouible to avoid it; for I saw them
come after me on high as ogre-t hill, and as
furious a: on enemy which i had no means or
strength to contend with: my business was to
hold my breath, and raise myself upon the
water, if I could; and so, by swimming, to
preserve my breathing, and pilot myself to-
wards the shore, if pouible; my greatest con-
cern now being, that the wave. as it would
carry me n great my toward: the shore when
it come on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back towards the see.
The wave that came upon me again buried
me at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own
body; and [could feel myselfouried with a
mighty force and swiflneu towards the shore,
.1 very great way; but I held my breath, end
assisted myself to swim still forwud with all

I had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet,
had no clothes to shill me, nor any thing either
to eater drink, to comfort me; neither did I
see any prospect before me, butthat of perish-
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild
beasts: and that which was particularly afllict-
in; to me was, that I had no weapon, either to
hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance,
or to defend myself against any other creature
that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a
word, I had nothing about me but a knife, I
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box.
This was all my provision; and this threw me
into such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a
while, I ran about like a madman. N ight
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart,
to consider what would be my lot if there were
any ravenous beasts inthttt oountry, seeing
at night they always come abroad for their
prey.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

All the remedy that ofl'ered to my thoughts,
at that time, was, to get up into aahiek bushy
tree, like a fir, but thornr--whieh grew near
me, and where I resolved to sit all night--and
consider the next day what death I should die,
for as yet I saw no prospectof life. I walked
about a furious from the shore, toaee if I could
find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to
my great joy; and having drank, and put a
little tobacco irtto my mouth to prevent hunger,
I went to the tree, and getting up into it, en-
deavoured to place mystelfso, as that if! should
fall asleep, I rn'mht not Gill; and having cut me
a short stick, like a truncheon, lbrmy defence,
1' took up my hedging; and having been ea-
eeaive'ly fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept
as comfortably as, I believe, fetv could have
done in my condition; and found myself the
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was
on such an occasion.

ARTICLES FROM THE WRECK--CONSI'RUC'I'S HIS HABITATION.

Watts I waited it was broad day, the wea-
ther clear, and the storm abated, so that the
sea did not rage and swell as belbre; but that
which surprised me most was, that the ship
was lifted off in the night from the sand where
she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was
driven up almost as far as the rock which I at
first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the wave dashing me against it. This being
within about a mile from the shore where I
was,a.nd the ship seeming to stand upright
still, {wished myself on board, that at least I
might save some necessary things for my we.

"'hen [came down from my apartment in
the tree, I looked about me again, and the first
thing I found was the boat; which lay, as the
wind and the sea had toned her up, upon the
land, about two miles on my right hand. I
walked as far as I could upon the shore to
have got to her; but found a neck, or inlet, of
water, between me and the boat, which was
about halfa toils broad: soIeatne back for
the present, being more intent upon getting at
the ship, where I hoped to find something for
my present subsistence.

A little alter noon, I fotmd the sea very
calm, and the tide ebhed so far out, that I could
come within a quarter of a mile of the ship:
ad herelfounda fresh renewingoftny grieft

for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on
board, we had been all safe; that is to say,we
had all got safe on shore, and I had not been
so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This
forced tears from my eyes again; but as there
was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible,
to get to the ship; so I pulled 03' my clothes,
for the weather was hot to extremity, and took
the water: but when I came to the ship, my
dilficuity was still greater to lmow how to get
on board: foras she lay aground, and high out
of the water, there was nothing within my reach -
to lay hold of. I swam rotmd her twice, and
the second time Ispied a small piece ofa
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first,
hang down by the fore-chains so low, as tha'
with great difficulty, I got hold of it, and by
the help ofthat rope pt into the forecastle of
the ship. Here I found thatthe ship was bulged,
andhad a greatdeal ofwater in her hold; but
that shelayso onthesideofabank ofhard
land, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted
up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to
the water. By this means all her qtnrter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry: for

and to seewhat was spoiledand what was

I went tothe bread-room, and filled my pockets

some rum in the greet cabin, of which I took

coast, my rah ran aground at one end of it
upon a shaft, and notbuing aground at the other
end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had
slipped otf towards that end that was afloat,
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost,
by selling my back against the cheats, to keep
them in their places, but could not thrust 03'
the raft with all my strength; neither dumt I
stir from the posture [was in, but holding up
the chests with all my might, I stood in that
manner near half an hour, in which time
the rising of the water brought me a little more
upon a level; and a little after, the water still
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her
otl' with the ear I had into the channel, and
then driving up higher, I at length found myself
. in the IIIth of a little river, with land on both
sides, and a strong current or tide running up.
I lookcdonboth sidesfor a proper place to
get to shore, for I was not willing to be dnven
too high up the river; hoping. in time, to see
some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to
place myself as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right
shore of the creek, to which, with pain
and difliculty, I guided my raft, and at last
got so near, as that reaching ground with my
car, I could thrust her directly' In; but here I
had like to have dipped all my cargo into the
sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to say, sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of my float, if it ran
on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower, as before, that it would endanger my
cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait
till the tide was at the highest, keeping the
raft vudt my car like an anchor, to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of
ground, which I expected the water would flow
over; and no it did. As soon as I fimnd
water enough, for my rah drew about a foot of
water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of
ground, and there fastened or moored her, by
sticking my ,lvro broken oars into the ground,
one on one side, near one end, and one on the
other side, near the other end: and thus I lay
till the water ehbed away, and left my raft, and
all my cargo safe on sh.oI-e

My next work was toview the country, and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and
where to stow my , to secure them from
whatever might happen. where I was, I yet
knew not; whether on the continent, or on an
island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited;
whether in danger of wild beats, or not.
There was a hill, not above a mile from me,
which rose up very steep and high, arm which

as in a ridge from it, northward. Ilookoul
one of the fowlingpicces, and one of thopis-
this, and a horn of powder; and thus armed, I
travelled for discovery up to the top of that
hill; where, after I had, with great labour and
dithculty, got up to the top, [saw my fate,to

my great affliction, viz. thatlwes In an island,
cnvironed every way with the sea, no land to
be seen, except some rocks, which lay II great
way 08', and two small islands, less than this,
which lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was
barren, and, as I saw good reason to believe,
uninhabited, except byg wild heuls,of whom,
howeter, I saw none; yet I saw abundance
of fowls, but knew not their kinds; neither,
when I killed them, could I tell what was fi'
for food, and what not. At my coming back_
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon
a tree, on the ride of a great wood. I believe
it was the first |gun that had been fired there
since the creation or the world: I had no
sooner fired, but from all the parts ofthe wood
there arose an innumerable number of forth,
of man? sorts, making a confused screaming,
and crying, every one |,nocording to his usual
note; but not one of them ofng any kind that I
knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it
to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak
resembling it, but it had no talons or claws
more titan common. It: flesh was carrion,
and lit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back
to my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo
on share, which took me up the rest of that
day: what to do with myself at rflght I knew
not, nor indeed where to rest: for I was shit!
to lie down on the , not knowing but
some wild beast might devour me; though, as
I afierwards fotmd, there was molly no need
for thou fears. However, as well as I could,
I barricadoed myself round with the cheetsand
boardsdtatlhadhroughton shoro,andmao'e
a kind of a hut forthat night's lodging. As
for food, I yet saw not which way to supply
myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures, like hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider, that I might yet
get a great many things out of the ship, which
would be useful to me, and particularly some
of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land; and I resolved to make
anollter voyage on board the vessel, if possi-
ble. And as I knew that the first storm that
blew must necessarily break her all to pieces,
I resolved to set all other things apart, till I
got every thing otIt of the ship that I could
get. Then I called a council, that is to say,
in my thoughts, whether I should take back
the raft; but this appeared impracticable: so
I resolved to go as before, when the tide was
down; and I did so, only that I stripped be-
fere I went from my but; having nothing on
but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and pre-
pared a second raft; and having had expe-
rience of the first, I neither made this so un-
Ivieldly, not loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me: as, first,
itt the cantenter's stores,I found two or three
hugs Inf-tails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a
dozen or two of hatchels; and, above all, that
most useful thing called a grindstone. All
these I secured together, with several things
bulonI-ing to tlte gunner; particularly, two or
three, iron crows, and two barrels of musket
built-Is, seven muskets, and another fowling-
piece, \Iilh some small quantity of ponder
Inort , a large bag fttll of small shot, and a
<<real roll of sheet lead; but this last was so
heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over tlte
ship's side. Besides these things, I took all
the men's clothes that I could find, and a spare
f-n-etopsail, a hammock, and some bedding;
and with this I loaded my second ran, and
brought them all safe on shore, to my very
great comfort.

I was under some apprehemions lest, during
my absence from the land, my provisions might
oe devoured on shore: but when I tame back,
I found no sign of any visiter; only there sat
a creature like a Ivild cat, upon one of the
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran
away a little distance, and then stood still.
She sat very composed and unconccmed, and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me, I presented my gun to
her, but, as she did not understand it, she was
perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer
to stir away , upon which I tossed her a bit of
biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very
free of It, for my store was not great: however,
I spared hora bit, I say, and she went to it,
smt- -lled of It, and ate it,nnd looked (as pleased)
for ntorc- , but I thanked her, and could spare
no more: so she matched ofl'.

Having got my second cargo on shore---
though I was fain to open the barrels of powder,
and brim! them by parcels, for they were too
heavy, being large casks--I went to work to
make me a little tent, with the sail, and some
poles, which I cut for that purpose; and into
this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoileitherwithrainorm; andI piled

23

all the empty chests and cults up in a circle
round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden
attempt either from man or beast.

When I had done this. I blocked up the
door 05 the tent with some boards within, and
an empty chest set up on end without; and
spreading one of the beds upon the ground,
laying my two pistols just at my head, and my
nun at length by me, I Ivcnt to bed for the first
time, and slept very quietly all night, for I
was Iery weary and heavy , for the niIIht be-
fore Iltad slept hide and had laboured very
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things
from the shIp, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now
that ever \\ as laid up, I believe, for one man:
but I "as not satisfied still: fir while the shIp
sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought
to get every thing out of her that I could: so
any day, at low water, I went on board, and
brought away something or other: but parti-
cularlv, the third time IIvt'lIt,I lmtul'ht away
as much of the ringing as I could, as also all
the small ropes :nd rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvass, which was to
mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel
of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away
all the sails first and last; only that I was Iain
to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a
time as I could; for they were no more uselul
to be sails, but as mere canvass only.

But that which comforted me still more was,
that, last of all after I had made five or six
such voIages as these, and thought I had
nothing more to expect from the ship that was
worth my meddling with; Isay, tiller all this,
I f mod n greathogshead of bread, and three
large runlets of rutn or spirits, arid a box of
sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was sur-
prising to mo, bacauseI had given over expect-
ing any more provisions, except what was
spoiled by . the water I soon emptied the
hogshead 'of that bread, and wrapped it up,
parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which
Icutout; and,inaword,Igotallthil afoot:
shore also.

The next day I made another voyage yoga, and
now having plundered the ship of what was
portable and fit to hand out, I began with the
cables, and cutting the great cable into pieces,
such as I could move, I got two cables and .
hawscr on shore, with all tho' Iron work I could
get; and having cut down the spritsaIlcyard
and the mizen-yard, and everything I could,
to make a larg e rail. lloaded it with all those
heavy goods; and came away: but Inng
luck began now to leave me; for th: tail was
so unwieldy, and so oIerladen. that allot-I was24

entered the little cove, where I had landed the
rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so
handily as I did the other, it overset, and
threw me and all my cargo into the water; as
formyselfiitwssnogresthartu, for Iwasnear
the shore; but as to my cargo. it was a great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I ex-
pected would have been of use to me:
however, when the tide was out, I got most of
the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the
iron.though with infinite labour; [hr I was fain
to dip for it into the water. a. work which
fatigued me very much. Aller this I went
every day on board, and brought away what
I could get.

I had been now thirteen dnys ashore, and
had been eleven times on board the ship; in
which time I had brought may all that one
pair of hands could well be capaltle
to bring; though I believe verily, had the calm
weather held, I should have brought away the
whole ship, piece by piece; but preparing, the
twelfih time, to go on board, I lbund the wind
began to rise: however, at low water, I went
on board; and though I thoughtlhnd rum-
msged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing
could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which 1 found two or
three tuna, and one pair of large scinors,
with some ten or admn of knives and
forks; in another I found about thirty-sis
pounds value in money, some E coin,
some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold,
and some silver.

I smiled to myselfatthe sight ofthis money:
0 drug! I exclaimed, whnt art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking
ofi'theground; oneof those knives istvorth
all this heap: I have no manner of use for
thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to
the bottom, as a cream whose lite is not
worth saving. However, upon second thoughts,
I took itaway; andwrapping all this in a
pieceofcanvass,I beganto think oftnalt'

thewind rose veryhanily,and beforeltw-

I lay, with all my wealth alrwt me very se-'
cure. It blew very hard all that night, and in
the morning, when I looked out, behold. no
more ship was to beseen! I waaalittle sur-
prised, but recovered myself with this satisfac-
tory reflection, viz. that I had lost no time,
nor abated no diligence, to get eveyy thing out
other that could be useful to me, and that, in-
deed, there was little lefi in her diet I was able
to bringaway,ifIbadhndtmretime.

I now pave over any more thoughts of the
ship. or of any thing out of her, except what
might drive on shore, frotn her wreck; as, irp
deed, divers pieces of her afterwards did; but
those things were ofsmalluse to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed
about securing myself against either outrages,
ifnny should appear,or wild beasts, if my were
in the island; and I had many thoughts of
the method how to do this, and what kind of
dwelling to make, whether I should ranks the
a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth:
and, in short, I resolved upon both: the man-
ner and description of which. it maynot be
' to give an account of

[soon foundtheplscel wasinwasnotfor
my settlement, particularly because it was upon
alow, moorish ground, near the sea, and! be-
lieved it would not be wholesome; and more
particularly become there was no fresh water
near it: sol resolved to findsvnorehenlthy
and more convenient spot of ground.

I conmlted several things in my situation,
which I found would be properforme: fit-u,
air and fresh water. I just now mentioned:
secondly, stroller from the heat of the sun:
thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, who-
ther men or beasts: fourthly,aview to the sea,
that if God sent anyitip in sight, I might
not lwe any advantage for my deliverance, of
which [was notwilling tobanisb all myuo
pectation yet.

In search foraplaec prtper hr this, Ifotmd
a little plain ontheaide ofa rising bill, whose
front towards this little plain was ateepas a
house side, so that'nothingcould come down
uponmefrom the top. 0!: tbeaide of this
rock there was a hollowplacs, worn a little
way in, like the entrance or door ofa cave;
but there was not really any cave, or way into
the rock, at all. '

0n the tlatoftbe green, just befitre thishol-
low place, I ruolved to pitch my tent. This
plain was not above a hundred yards broad,
and abouttwiosaalongnndlayliltes green
before my door, and, at the end of it, do--
scended irregularly every way down into the
low ground by the seaside. It was on the N.
N. W. side ofthe hill; so that it was sheltered
from the heat every day, till it came to a W.
and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those
countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle
before the hollow-place, which took in about
ten yards in its semidiameter from the rock,
and twenty yards in its diameter, from its be-
ginning and ending. . .

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of
strong stakes, driving them into the ground till
they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end
being out of the ground about five feet and a
half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows
did not stand above six inches from one an-
other.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I

25

cut in the ship, and laid them in rows, one
upon another, within the circle, between these
two rowsof stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them,
about two feet and a halfhigh, like a spur to a
post; and this fence was so strong, that nei-
ther man nor beast could get into it or over it.
This cost me a great deal oftime and labour,
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring
them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be
not by a door, but by ashort ladder to 0 over
the top; which ladder, when l was in, lined
over alter me; and so I was completely fenced
in and fortified, as I thought, from all the
world, and consequently slept secure in the
night, which otherwise I could not have done,
though," it appeared afterwards, there was
no need of all this caution against the enemies
that I apprehended danger from.

CARRIES ALI: BIS BICHES, PROVISIONS, ETC. INTO HIS HABITATION.--DIIA~
RINESS 0P SOLITUDE.--CONSOLATOBY REFLECTIONS.

Imo this fence, or fortress, with infinite la-
hour, I carried all my riches, all my provisions,
ammunition, and stores, of which you have
the account above; and I made a large tent,
which, to preserve me from the rains, that in
one part of the year are very violent there, I
made double, viz. one smaller tent within, and
one larger tent above it, and covered the up-
permost with a large tarpauling, which I had
saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the
bed which I had brought on shore, but in a
hammock, which was indeed a very good one,
and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions,
and every thing that would spoil by the wet;
and having thus enclost all my goods, I made
up the entrance, which till now I had left ,
and so passedandrepaaoed, asIeaid, by a
short ladder. '

WhenIbaddonethis,Ibegan towork my
way into the rock, and bringing all the earth
and stones that I dug down out through my'
tent, I laid them up within my fence in the
nature ofa terrace, so that it raised the ground
within aboutafootand ahalf;andthusImade
me a cave, just behind my tent, which served
me like a collar to my house. It cost me much

labour and many days, before all these things
were brought to perfection; and therefore I
must go back to some other things which took
up some of my thoughts. At the same time
it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the. cave,
that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark
cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened,
and alter that, a great clap of thunder, as is
naturally the efi'wt of it. I was not so much
surprised with the lightning, as I was with a
thought, which darted into my mind as will
as the lightning itself: 0 my powder! My
very heart sunk within me when I thought, that
atone blast, all my powder might be destroyed;
on which, not my defence only, but the pro-
viding no food, as I thought, entirely depended.
I was nothing near so anxious about my own
danger, though, had the powder took fire,l had
never known who had hurt me.

Such impmion did this make upon me,
that alter the storm was over, I laid aside a'.
my works, my building and fortifying, and ap-
plied myself to make and boxes, to sepa-
rate the powder, and to keep it a little and a
little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might
come, it might not all take fire at once; and
to keep it so apart, that it should'not be pos-26

aiblo to make one part fire another. I finiahnd
this work in about a limitight: and I think my
powder, which in all was about two hundred
and forty pounds weight, was divided in not
less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
danger from that; so I placed it in my new
cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen,
and the rest I hid up and down in holes among
the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing,
I went out at least once every day with my
gun, as well to divert. myself, as to see if I
could kill any thing fit for food : and, asnear as
I could, to acquaint myself with what the island
produced. The first time I went out, I pre-
aently discovered that there were goats upon
the island, which was a great satisfaction to
me: but then it was attended with tltis mir-
fix-tune to me, viz. that they were so shy, so
subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was tho
most difficult thing in the world to come at
them: but I was not discouraged at this, not
doubting but I might now and then shoot one,

as it soon happened; foraiier I had found their '

hauntsn little, I laid wait in this manner for
them: I observed, if they saw me in the
valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they
would run away as in a terrible fright: but if
they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me;
from whence I concluded, that by the position
of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects
that were above them: so, afterwards, I took
this method--I always climbed the rocks first,
to get above them. and then had frequentlya
fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures, I killed a she goat, which had a.
little kid by her, which she vc suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell,
the kid Blood flock still by her, till I canto and
took her up: and not only so, but when I can-
riod the old one with Inc, upon my shoulders,
the lid followed me quite to my enclosure:
upon which, I laid down the dam, and took the
lrid in my arms, and carried it over my pale,
in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would
not eat: so I was forced to kill it, and eat it
myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
great while, for I ate sparingly, and preserved
my provisions (my bread especially) as much
as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found
it absolutely necesary to provide a place to
make a lire in, and fitel to burn; and what
Ididfor that." alsohovv I enlarged my cave,

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON 030803.

and what conveniences I made, I shall given
full accotmt of it in its proper place: but I
must first give some little account ofvnyaelf,
and of my thoughts about living. which, it may
well besuppooed, were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition;
for as I was not'cast away upon that island
without being driven, as is said, by a violent
storm quite out of the course of our intended
voyage; and a great way, viz. some hundreds of
leagues, out of theordinary eourac of the trade
of mankind, I had great reason to consider it
as a determination of Heaven, that in this
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears wmld run
plcntifitlly down my face when I made theao
reflections; and sometimes I would eapostu-
late with myself why Providence should thus
completely ruin its creatures, and render them
soahsolutely miserable; no abandoned without
help, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swifi upon
me to check these thoughts, and to repmvo
me: and particularly, one day, walking with
my gun in my hand,hy the seaside, I was very
pensive upon the subject of my present condi-
tinn,when reason, a it were, cxpostulated with
me the other way, thus: Well, you are in a
desolate condition, it is true ; but, pray remem
ber, where are the rest of you? Did not you
come eleven of you into the boat? Where are
the ten'! Why were not they saved, and you
lost fl Why were you singled out? Is it
better to be here or there? And then I point-
ed to the sea. All evils are toheconsiderod
with the good that is in them, and with what
worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well
I was furnished for my subsistence, and what
would have been my case if it had not hap-
pened (which was a hundred thousand to one)
that the ship floated from the place where she
first struck, and was driven so near to the
shore, that I had time to get all these things
out of her: what would have been my case,
if I had been to have lived inthe condition in
which I at first came on shore, without necosp
min of life, or necessaries to supply and pro-
cure them ? Particularly, aaidIaloud (though
to myself) what shouldI have done without a
gun, without ammunition, without any tools to
make any thing, or to work with, without clothes,
bedding, stem, or any manner of covering?
and that now I had all these to asuficient quan-
tity, and was in afaii' way to provide myself
in such a manneras to live without my gun,
when my ammunition was lpent: I0 that I

but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows; which. however, though I found it an-
lwer, made driving these posts or piles \'ery
laborious and tedious work. But what need I
have been concerned at the tediousness of any
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to
do it in? nor had I any other employment, if
that had been over, at least that Icould foresee,
except the ranging the island to seek for food;
whtch I did, more or less, every day.

I now began tomsidcr seriously my condi-
tion. and the circumstance I was reduced to;
and I drew up the state of my afl'airs in writing,
not so much toleavc them to any that were to
come after me, (for I was like to have hum-w
heirs.) as to deliver my thoughts front daily
poring upon them, and atflicting my mind: and
as my reason began now to master my despon--
dent-y, I began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and toset the good against the evil, that
I might have something to distinguish my use
liom worse ; and I stated very impartially, like
debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed
against the miseries I sufl'ered, thus:

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Having now brought my mind a little to re-
lish my condition. and given over looking out
to sea, tosee if I could spy a ship ; I say, giv-
ing over these things, I hem to apply myself
to accommodate my way of living, andto make
things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation,
which was a tent under the side of a rock, sur-
rounded with a strong pale of posts and cables:
but I might now rather call it a wall, for I
raised a kind of wall against it of turfs, about
about two feet thick on the outside: and after
some time (I thinlt it was a year and a half)
Irnised rafters from it, leaning to the rock,
and thatched or covered it with bought: of trees,
and such things as I could get, to keep oultlto
rain; which I found, at some times of the year,
very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all
my goods into this pale, and into the cave
which Ihad made behind me. But I must
observe, too, that at first this was a confused
heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order,

0 they took up all my place; I had no room
to turn myself: so I set myself to enlare my
cave, and work farther into the earth; .ur it
was a loose, sandy roclt, which yielded easily
to the lubourI bestowed on it: and when I
found I was pretty safe usto tho beastsuf prey,
I worked sideways, to the right hand, into the
rock,and then turning to the right again, worked
quite out, and made me a door to come out in
the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress,
as it were, a hackway to my tent and to my
storehouse, bttt gave me room to slim my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make
such necessary things as I tbund I most wanted,
particularly a chair and a table; tin- without
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts
I had in the world; I could not write, or eat,
ordo several things with so much pleasure,
without stable: so I went to work. And here
I must needs observe, that as reason is the sub-
stance and or'ginal of the mathematics, so by
stating and squaring every thing by reason,
and by making the most rational judgment of
things, every man may be, in time, master of
every mechanic art. I had never handled a
tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour,
application, and contrivance, I found, at last,
that I wanted nothing but I could have made,
cipecially if! had had tools. However, I made
abundance of things, even without tools; and
some with no more tools than an ads: and
a. hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite labour.
For example, ifIwanted a board. I had no
otherwsybut to cut down once, so: it on an
edge before me, and how it flat on either side
with my tire, till I had brought it to be as tltin
as a plunkuaml then dub it smooth with my
ndze. It is true, by this method I could make
but one board ofa whole tree; but this I had
no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for :t prodigious deal of time and labour
which it look me up to make a plank or board:
but my time or labour was little worth, and so
it was as well employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as
I observed above, in the first. place ; and this I
did out of the short pieces of boards that I
brought on my nft from the ship. But when
I wrought out some boartk, as above, I made
large shelves, of the hremlth of a foot and a
hail', one over another, all along one side of my
cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron work
on; and, in a word, to separate every thing at
large in their places, that I might easily come
at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of
the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that
would hang up: so that had my cave been seen,
it looked like a general magazine of all neces-
my things; and I had every thing so ready at
my hand, that it was it great pleasure to me to
see all my goods in such order, and especially
to find my stock of all necessaries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep n
journalof every day's employment; for, in-
deed, at first, I was in too much httrry, and
notenly as to labour, but in much discomposure

ot'mind; and my journal would. too, bavebeen
full of many dull thing's: for example, I mufl
hava said thus--"Sept. 80th. After I had
got to shore, and had escaped ing, in-
stead of being thankful to God for my deliver-
ance, having first vomited, with the great
quantity ol' salt water which was gotten into

ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and
boating my head and (Ewe, exclaiming at my
misery, and cryiu guilt, I was undone, undone!
till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down

Some days after this, and after I had been
on board the ship and got all that I coukl out

of a little mountain. and looking out to sen. in
hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a

wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved
to death for want of food. At the approach of
night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures;
but slept awndly, though it rained all night.
Defence 1. In the morning I saw, to my
great surprise, the ship had floated with the
high tide, and was driven on shore again much
nearer the island; which, as it was homecom-
fort on one hand, (for seeing her sit uptight,

the ship, or, at least, that they would not have
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had
the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat, out of the ruins ofthe ship, to
have carried us to some other part of the world.
I spent great part of this day in perplexing my-
self on these things; but, at length, seeing the
ship almost dry, I went upon the send as nesras
I could, and then swam on board. This day also
it continued raining, though with no wind atall.

From the let of October to the 24th. All
these days entirely spent in many several voy-
ages to get all l could out of the ship: which
I brought on shore, every title of flood, upon
rafts. Much rain also in these days, though
with some intervals of fair weather; but it
seems this was the rainy season.

Oct. 20. I oversct my ral't, and all the
goods I had got upon it; but being in shoal
water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I
recovered many of them when the tide was
out.

04!. 25 It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of tvind . during which time the
ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing it lit-
tle harder than helhre,) and was no more to be
seen. except the wreck of her, and that only
at low water. I spent this day in covering and
securing the goods which I had saved, that the
rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost
all day, to find out a place to fix my habitation ;
greatly concerned to secure myself from any
attack in the night, either from wild beasts or
men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper
place, under a rock, and marked out a semi-
circle l'or my encampment; which I resolved
to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica-
tion. made of double piles, lined within with
cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 80th, I worked very
hard in carrying all my goods to my new ha-
hitation, though some part of the time it rained
exceedingly hard.

The 3m, in the morningJ went out into the
island with my gun, to seek the some food,a.nd

and with them firmed a fence round me,a
little within the place I had marked on for
my fortification.

ale who! I hadto live on; and from twelve to
two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
emive hot; and then, in the evening, to
work again. The working part of this day
and the next was wholly employed in making
my table, for I was yet huts very sorry work-
man; though time and necessity made too a.
complete natural mechanic soon after, as l be-
lieve they would any one else.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my
gun and dog. and killed a wild eat; her skin
pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing: of
every creature that I killed 1 took of the skins,
and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-
shore, I saw many sorts of sea-thwl which I
did not understand; but was surprised, and
almost frightened, with two or three seals;
which. while I was gazing at them (not well
knowing what they were.) got into the sea,
and escaped me for that time.

mote from one another as possible. On one
oftheso three days I killed a large bird that
was good to eat; but I knew not what to
call it.

Nov. 11. This dayI began to dig behind
my tent, into the rock, to make room for my
farther convenience.

Non. Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz. a piokaxe, a shovel, and a
wheelbarrow, or basket; so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply
these wants, and make me some tools. As
for a pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy: but
the next thing was a shovel or spade; this
was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I
could do nothing effectually without it; but
what kind of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it,
which, in the Brazils, they call the iron tree,
from its exceeding hardness: of this, with
great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I
cut a piece; and brought it home, too, with
difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and my
having no other way, made me a long while
upon this machine: for I worked it effectually,
by little and little, into the form of a shovel or
spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours
in England, only that the broad part having
no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long; however, it served well
enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe,
made after that fashion, or so long a making.

I was still deficient: for I wanted a basket,
or a wheelbarrow. A basket I could not make
by any means, having no such things as twigs
that would bend to make wicker-ware; at
least, none yet found out: and as to the wheel-
barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel,
but that I had no notion of; neither did Iknow
how to go about it: besides, I had no possible
way to make iron gudgeons for tho spindle or
axis of the wheel to run in; so I gave it over:
and, for carrying away the earth which I dug
out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod,
which the labourers carry mortar in for the
brieklayers. This was not so dificult to me
as the making the shovel: and yet this and the
shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no leg
than t'ourdays; I mean, always excepting my
morning walk with my sun, which I so dorn
omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing
bomosernething lit to eat.

Nov. 28. My otherwork having nqw stood

31

still, because of my making these tools, when

they were finished I went on; and working

every day, as my strength and time allowed, I

spent eighteen days entirely in widening and

deepening my cave, that it might hold my
commodiously.

Non. During all this time, I worked to
make this room, or cave, spacious enough to
accommodate me as awarehouse or magazine,
a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As
for a lodging, I kept to the tent; except that
sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it
mined so hard that Icould not keep myself
dry; which caused me afterwards to cover all
my place within my pale with long poles, and
in the form of rafters, leaning inst the rock,
and load them with flags and rge leaves of
trees, like a thatch.

DECEMBER 10. I began now to think my
cave or vault finished; when on a sudden (it
seems I had made it too large) a great quantity
of earth fell down from the top and one side:
so much, that, in short, it iiightened me, and
not without reason too; for if I had been under
it, I should never have wanted a grave-digger.
Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of work
to do over again, for I had the loose earth to
carryout; and, which was of more importance,
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be
sure no more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it
accordingly; and got two shores or posts
pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of
board across over each post: this I' finished
the next day; andsetting moi'e posts up with
boards, in about aweekmore I hid therooi'
secured ; and the posts,standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part of? my house.

Dec. 11. From this day to the 30th, I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the
posts, to hang every thing up that could be
hung up: and now I began to be in some order
within doors.

Dec. 20. I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnish my house, and set
up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to
order my vicwals upon; but bomds began to be
very scarce with me: also I made me another

table.

Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my
dog. and set him upon the goats: but I was

dog: and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.

JAN. 3. I be-mn my fence or wall, which,
being still jealous of my being attacked by
somebody, I resolved to Inake very thick and
strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I
purposely omit what was said In the journal: it
is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time
than from the 3d of January to the Mth of
April, working, finishing. and perfecting this
wall; though it was no more than about twenty-
the yards III length, being a half circle, from
one place In the rock to another place, about
twelve yanhfrom it, the door of the cave being
in the centre. behind it.

All this time I worked veryltard: the rains

bigger than [needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the out.

close to it, I persuaded myself that if any peo-
ple were to come on shore there they would
not perceive anything like a habitation: and
It was very well I did so, as may be observed

these walks, of smnething or other to my ad-
vantage; partimIlar-II'J found a kind of wild
pigeons, who build, not as woodpigeons, in I.
tree, but rather as haunt-pigeons, in the holes
of the rocks: and, taking some young ones, I
endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did
so; but when they grew older, they IleII all
away; which, perhaps, "as at first for want of
feeding them, for [bad nollnno to giIc them:
hquII-r, I frequently found their nests, and
got their young ones, whidt were very gwd
meat. And now, in the managing my house-
hold ntTaiIs, I found myselfwanting in many
things, which I thought :It first it was impos-
sible for me to make; as indeed, as to some of
them, it was: for instance, 1 could never make
a cask to be hooped. I had a small rutIlet or
two, as I observed before; but Icould never
arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it: I could
neither put in the heads, nor join the slaves so
true to one another as to make them hold
water; so I gave that also over. In the next
place,l was at a great hm for candle; so that
as soon as it was dark, which was generally
by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed.
I remember the lump of bees-wax with which
I made mlles in my Ali-icon adventure; but
I had none ofthttt new: the only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved
the tallnw; and with a little dish made ofciay,
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a.
trick of some oakutn, I made me a lamp; and
this gave me light, though not a clear steady
light like a candle. In the middle of all my
labours it happened, that in rummaging my
things, I found a little bag; which. as I hinted
belitre. had been filled with corn, [hr the tired-
ing of poultry , not tbr thiSI0yag _e, but before,
as I suppose, when the ship came from Lis-
bon. What little remainder of com had been
in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and
I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some
other use, (I think, it was to put powder in,
when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or
some such use.) I shook the hooks of corn out
ofit, on one side of my fortification, under the

rock.

It was a little before the great rain just now
mentioned, tho! I throw this stufl'awny; taking
nonotioe ofany thing, and notoonwcb as re-
membering that I hld thrown any thing there .
when about a month after, I saw some few
stalks of sntnethina green. shooting out of the
ground, which I famicd might be some plant I
had not seen; but. 1 was surprised, and per-
belly vanished, when, alter a little longer
time, I sew about ten or twelve eats come out,
which were perfect green barley of the same
kind as our European, nay, as our English
barley. _

It is impossible to express the astonishment
and confusion of my thoughts on this occasion :
I had hitherto acted upon no religious founda-
tion at all; indeed, I had very few notions of
leligian in my head, nor had entertained any
sense of any thing that bed befallcn me,
otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly
say, what pleasesGod; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these
'hings, or his order in governing events in the
world. But after I saw barley grow there, in
a climate which I knew was not proper for
corn. and especially as I knew not how it
come there, it startled me strangely; and I
began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow without any help of
seed sown, and that it was sodirectod purely
lbr my sustenance, on thatwild misereble place.

This touched my host! a little, and brought
tears out of my eyes: and I began to bless my-
self that such a prodigy of nature should hap-
nen upon my account: and this was the more
strange to me, because I saw near it still, all
along by the side ofthe rock, sortie other slug.
gling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice,
and which! knew,bseause I had seen itgrow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but, not doubt-
ing that there was more in the place, I went
overall that part of the island where I had
been before, searching in every corner, and
under every rock, for more ofit; but I could
not find any. At last it occurred to my
thoughts, that I had shook out a bsgofehick-
en's meat in that. place, and than the wonder
began toeease: and I must confess, my reli-
gious thankfulness to God's ' enee
to abate too, upon the discovering thst all this
was nothing but whet was common; though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange
and unforeseen a providence, as ifit had been
miraculous: for it was really the work ofPro-
villenee, as to me, that should order or appoint
that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain
unspoiled, when the rats had d all the
rest,asil'ithadhcn fromlteaven;

I carefully saved the ears ofthis corn, you
may be sure, in their season, which was about
the end of June: snd,laying up every corn, I
resolved to sow them all again: hoping, in
time, to have some quantity ulficient to sup-
ply me with bread. But it was not till the
fiturth year that I could allow myself the least
grain ofthis corn to eat, and even then but spa-
ringly, as I shullshow afterwards, inits order;
furl lost all that I sowed the first season, by
not observing the proper time ; us I sowed just
before the dry season, so that it never came up
at all, at least not as it would have done; of
which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, m above.
twenty or thirty stalks of rice, which I pre-
served with the same care ; and whose use
was of the same ltind, or to the same purpose,
viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I
found ways tocoolt it up without batting, though
I did that also allersometime.--But to return
to my Journal.

I worked excessively hsrd these three or
four months, to gctmywall done i antltlte "III
of April I closed it up; conniving to get into
it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder,
that there might be no sign on the outside of
my habitation.

Ann. 18. I finished theladder; soI went
up with the ladder to the top, and then pulled
it up alter me, and let it down in lho inside:
this was a complete enclosure to me ; for within
I had room enough, and nothing could come at
mefrotn without,unless it could first mountmy
wall.

The very next day aller this wall was finished,
I had almost all my labour overthrown at once,
and myself killed: the case was thus :---As I
was busyinthe inside of it. behind my tent,
just at the entrance into my care, I was ter-
ribly frightened with a most dreadful surpri-
sing thing indeed; for,all on a sudden, I found
the earth come crumbling down from the roof

shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood
on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a
rock, which stood about half a rude from me,
next the sea, fell down, with such a. terrible
noise asI never heard in all my life. I perh
ceived also that the very uea was put intoviolent
motion by it; and I believe the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself
(having never felt the like. nordiscoutsed with
any one that had) that 1 "as like one dead or
stupilied- and the motion of the earth made
my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at
sea: but the noise of the falling of the rock
anaked me, as it were; and rousing me from
the stup iticd condition I was in, filled me with
horror, pand I thought of nothing but the hill
falling upon my tent and my household goods,
and burying all at once; this sunk my \ery
soul within me a second time.

After the third shock "as over, and I felt
no more for some time, Ibegan to take cou-
rage: yet I had not heart enough to go over
my "all again, for fear of being buried alive,
btit sat stillupon the ground greatly castdown,
and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All
this while, I had not the least serious religious
thought; nothing but the common Lard, hwe
mercy me. 'and when it was over, that went
away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast,
and grow cloudy, asif it would rain; and soon
alier the wind rose by little and little, so that
in less than hall'an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, co-
vered with foam and froth: the shore was
covered with a breach of the water; the trees
were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm
it was. This held about three hours, and then
began to abate; and in two hours more it was
quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All
this while I set upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it
came into my thought., that 'these winds and
rain being the consequence of the earthquake,
the earthquake itselfwas spent and over, and
I might venture into my cave again. With
this thought my spirits began to revive; and
the rain also helping to persuade me, [went
in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was
sovinlent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it: and I was forced to get into my
care, though very much afraid and uneasy ,for
fear it should fall on my head. This violent
ruin l'orced me to a new work, viz. to cut a
hole through my new fortification, like a sink,
to let the water go out, which would else have

drowned my case. AfterI had been in my
care for some time, and found no ntoreshoeks
of the earthquake follow, I began to be more
composed. And now to support my spirits,
which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum;
which, however, I did then. and always, very
sparingly, knowing I could have no more when
that was gone. It continued raining all that
night, and great part of the next day. so that I
could not stir abroad: but my mind being more

com,posed I began to think ofnhnt I had best
do; concluding, that if the island was suijct
to these earthquakes, there Would he no Irving
fbr me in a cave, but I must consider of build
in; me some little hut in an open place, which
I might surround with a wall, as I had done
here, and so make myself secure from wild
beasts or men: for if I stayed where I was,l
should certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.

"'ith these thoughts, I resolved to remove
my tent from the place where it now stood,
being just under the hanging precipice of the
hill, and which, if it should be shaken again,
would certainly fall upon my um. I spent the
two next days, being the 19th and 20th of
April, in contriving where and how to remove
my habitation. The fear of being swallowed
alive atfeeted me so, thatInever slept in quiet ;
and yet the apprehension of lying abroad,
without any fence, was almost equal to it: but
still, when I looked about, and saw how every
thing was put in order, how pleasantly I was
concealed, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove. 1n the mean time,
it occurred to me that it would require a vast
deal of time for me to do this; and that I must.
be contented to run the risk where I was. till
I had formed a convenient camp. and secured
it sons to remove to it. With this conclusion
Icornposed myself for a time; and resolved
that I would go to work with all speed to build
me a. wall with piles and cables, Ste. in a circle
as before, and set up my tent in it when it
was finished; but that I would venture to stay
where l was till it was ready, and fit to re-
move to. This was the 2lst.

a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my

miraculous in it; butassoon as that part of
tlte thought was removed, all the impression
which was raised from it wore otf also, as I
have noted already. Even the earthquake,
though nothing could be more terrible in its
nature, or more immediately directing to the
invisible Power which alone directs such things,
yet no sooner was the flight over, but the im-
pression it had made went ofl' also. I had no
more sense ofGod, or his judgments, much
less of the present alfliction of my circum-
stances being from his hand, than if I had
been in the most prosperous condition of lilit.
But now, whm I began to be sick, and a Ici-
surc view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began
to sink under the burden of a strong distemper,
and nature was exhausted with the violence of
the fever; conscience. that had slept so long,
began to awake; and I reproached myself with
my past life, in which I had It) evidently, by
uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice
of God to lay me under uncommon strokes,
and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me for the second
or third day of my distemper; and in the
violence, as well of the fever as of the dread-
ful reproaches of my conscience, extorted from
me some words like praying to God: though I
cannot say it was a prayer attended either
with desires or with hopes; it was rather the
voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts
were confused; the convictions great upon tny
mind; and the horror of dying in such a mi-
serable condition, raised vapours in my head

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

with the more apprehension: and, in then
hurries of my soul, I know not what my
tongue might express: but it was ratlm excl>>
mation, such as, Lord, what a miserable crea-
ture am I! If I should be sick, I shall cer-
tainly die for want of help; and what will be-
come of me? Then the tears burst out of my
eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice ol' my father
came to my mind, and presently his predic-
tion, which I mentioned at the beginning of
this story, viz. that if I did take this foolish
step, God would not bless me; and I should
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, whenthere might be none
to assist in my recovery. Now, said I, aloud,
.my dear father's words are come to pass ; God's
justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Pro-
vidence, which had mercifully put mein a sta-
tion of life whereinI might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it, myself, nor
learn from my parents to know the blessingof it.
I left them to mourn over my folly; and now I
am lefl to mourn under the consequences of it:
I refused their help and assistance, who would
have pushed me in the world, and would have
made every thing easy to me; and now I have
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support; and no assistance, In:
comfort, no advico. Then I cried out, Lord,
be my help, for] am in great distress. This
was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I
had made for many years. But I return to
my Journal.

J Um: 28. Having been somewhat refreshed
with the sleep I had had, and the lit being en-
tirely off, I got up; and though the fright and
terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sialercd that the fit of the ague would return
again the next day, and now was my time to
get something to refresh and support myself
when I should be ill. The first lltingI did
was to fill a large square case-bottle with
water; and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed: andtotalteott'the chill or sguishdispo--
sition of the water, I put about a quarter of a
pint of run into it, and mixed them together.
ThenI gumspiece oftbe goat's flesh, and

broiled it on the coals, but cottld eat very little ;
I walked about; but was very weak, and
with] very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense
of my miserable condition, dreading the return
of my distemper the next day. At night, I
made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs
which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we
call it, in the shell: and this was the first bit
of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as
I could remember in my whole life. Alicr I
had eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself
so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun,
(for I never went out without that ;) so I went

looking out upon the sea, which was just
before me, and very calm and smooth. As I
sat here, some such thoughts as these occur-
red to me: What is this earth and sea, of
which I have see somuch'! 'Whence is it
produced '1 IA am I, and all the other
creatures, w' . ' e, human and brutal?
thnce are " rely, we are all made
by some secret - - er, who formed the earth
and sea, the air and sky. And who is that?
Then it followed most naturally, It. is God
that has made all. Well, but then, it came
on, if God has made all these things, he guides
and governs them all, and all things that con-
cern them; for the power that could make all
things, must certainly have power to guide and
direct them: if so, nothingcan happen in the
great circuit of his works, either without his
knowledge or appointment.

And ifnothing happens without his know-
ledge, he knows that I am here, and am in
this dreadful condition: and if nothing hap-
pens without his appointment, he has appoint-
ed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to
my thought, to contradict any of these con-
clusions: and therefore it refled upon me
with the greatest force, that it must needs be
that God had appointed all this to befall me;
that I was brought to this miserable circum-
stance by his irectioo,he having the sole
power, not of me only, but ofovery thing that
happens in the world. Immediately it fol-
lowed, Why has God done this to me? What
have I done to be thus used 3 My conscience
presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I

  
   
 

had blasphemed: and rnethought it spoke to
me like a voice, Wretch! dost thou ask what
thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
mispent life, and ask thyself, what thou hast
not done? disk, why is it that thou wort not
long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not
drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the
tight when the ship was taken by the Sallce
man of war; devoured by the wild beasts on
the coast of Africa; or drowned here, when
all the crow perished but thyself? Dost thou
ask what thou hast done 'I I was struck dumb
with these reflections, as one astonished, and
had not a word tony; no, not toenswer to
myself; and, rising up pensive and sad, walked
back to my retreat, and went ovor my wall, as
in had been going to bed: but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and Ihad no inclination
to sleep; so I sat down in the chair, and
lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now, as the apprehension of the return of my
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my t, that the Brazilians take no
physio but their tobacco for almost all distem-
pets; andIhadapiece ofarolloftobaoco in
one of the chests, which was quite cured;
and some aleothat was green, and not quite
cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt: for
in this chest Ifound a cure both for soul and
body. I opened the cheat, and found what 1
looked for, viz. the tobacco; and asthe few
books I had saved lay there too, 1 took outoae
of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and
which to this time I had not found leisure, or40

lo much u inclination, to look into. I say,
I took it out. and brought both that and die
tobacco with me to the table. \Vhat use to
make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dis.
temper, nor whether it was good for it or not;
bttt I tried several experiments with it, as if I
wan resolved it should hit one way or other.
I first look a piece of a leaf, and chewed it
in my mouth; which, indeed, at first, almost
sutpifiud my brain; the tobacco being green and
strong.und:uchasIhadnot been much used to.
Then I took some and steeped it an hour or
two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose
of it when Ilay down: and, lastly y, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of It aslong as I could
bear it; as well for llte heat, as almost
for animation. In the internal of this ope-
ration, I look up the Bible, and began to read;
but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading. at least at that time;
only, having Opened the book casually, the
first words that occurred to me were these:
" Call on me in the day oftroublc. and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
These words were very apt. to my case; and
made some impression upon my Ihounhts at
the time of reading them though not so much
as they did afterwards; for, as for being de-
livered, the word had no sound, as I may say,
to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible
in my apprehension of things, that, as the
children of Israel said when they were pro-
mised tit-sh to eat, " Can God spread a table
in the wilderness?" so I be to say, Can
even God himself deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any
hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon
my thoughts: but, however, the words made
a great impression upon me, and I mused
upon them very ofien. It now grewlate; and
the tobacco had, as I nid,dezed my head so
much, that I inclined to sleep: sol left my
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want
any thing In the night, and went to bed. But
before I lay down,I did what. I never had done
in all my life; I kneeled down, and prayed to
God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I cal-
led upon him in the day of trouble he would
deliver me. After my broken and imperfect
prayer was over, I drank the rum in which!
had steeped the tobacco; which was so strong
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed! could
scarce get it down: immediately upon this I
wenttobed. I fotmd presently the rum flew
up into my head violently; but I fell into a
mud alumna! waked mmtill, by the
Ian, it must necessarily be near three o'clock

I should lose a day out of my reckoning In the

freshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful.
when I got up, I was stronger than I was the

hungry; and, in short, I had no lit the next
day, but continued much altered fur the better.
This "as the 2911b.

The Walt was my well day, ofcnttrse; and
I went abroad with my gttn,but did not care
to trawl too far. I killed a sI-afuwl or two,
mmethino like ahrand "00"), and brought them
home ' but was not very (inward to eat them;
so I ate some more of the turtle' 3 ends which
were vrr3 good. This owning I renewed the
medicine. which I had supposed did mo mod
the day btfure, viz. the tobacco steeped In rum;
only I did not take soup-ch as before, nor
did I chew any of the" old my head

  
   
 

over the smoke: howev ,' not so well
the next day, which 'of July, as!
hoped Ishould have been; or I had a little of

the cold fit, but it was not much.

JULI'2. I renewed the medicine all the
three ways: and dosed myself with it as at
first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

Jun 3. I missed the fit for good and all,
though I did not recover my full etrmgtlt for
some weeks after. \'Vhile [was thus gath-
ering strength, my thoughts ran trrceedingly
upon this scripture, "I wtll deliter Ihee' ,
and the impossibility of my deliverance lay
much upon my mind, in bat-of my ever ex-
pecting it. - but as I was discouraging myself
with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind
that I pored so much upon my deliverance
from the main aflliction, that I d'uregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was,
as it were, made to ask myulf such queuinne
as these, viz. Have I not been delivered, and
wonderfully too, from sight-tees: from the must
dimmed condition that could be, and that
wan l0 f nghtl'ul to Inc 'I and what notice have
[taken of It? Have I done my part? God
has delivered me, but I havey not glorified
him; that is to say, I have not owned and
been thankful forthat u a deliverance: and
howcanl expects greaterdetiuranee'l This
touched my heart very much: and immediate-
ly I knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud
fir my recovery from my sickness.

Jun 4. In the morning! took the Bible;
and beginning at the New Testament, lbc-
gen seriously to read it: and imposed upon
myselfto read awhile every morning and ev-try
night; not binding myself to the number of
chapters, but as long as my thoughts should
engage me. It was not long alier Isct scri-
ottxly to this work, thalI found my heart more
deeply and sincerely alfectcd with the wick-
cdnossof my past life. The impression of my
dream revived; and the words, All these
things have not brought thee to repentance, ran
seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when
it happened providentially, the very same day,
that, reading the scripture, I came to these
words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Sa-
viour: to give repentance, and to give remis-
aion." Ithrcw down the book: and with my
heart as well as my hands lined up to hea-
ven. in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out
aloud, Jesus, thou sort ofDavid! Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repent-
ance! This was the first time in all my life I
could say, in the true sense ofthc words, that
I prayed; for My I prayed with a sense of
my condition, andt'with atrue scripture view
of hope, fimndcd on the encouragement of the
vrord ofGod: and from this time, I may say,
I began to have hope that God would hear Inc.

Now I began to construe the Words men-
tioned above, "Call on me, and I will deliver
thee," in a different sense from what I had
ever done before; for then I had no notion of
any thing being called deliverance, but my being
delivered from the captivity I was in: for
though I was indeed at large in the place, yet
the island was certainly a prison to me, and
that in the worst sense in the world. But
now I learned to take it in another sense: now
I looked back upon my past life with such
horror, and my sins appeared an dreadful, that
my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance
from the load of guilt that bore down all my
ounfort. As for my solitary life,it was nothing i
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from
it, orthink of it ; it was all of no consideration,
in comparison with this. And I add this part
here, to hint to whoever vhall read it, that
whenever they come to a true-sense of things,
they will find deliverance from sin a much
greater blessing thandclivcranccfrom afiliction.

My condition began now to be, though not
lean miserable u to my way of living, yet
much easiertornymind: andmy

being directed, by constantly reading the scrip-
ture and praying to God, to things of a higher
nature, I had a grout deal of Comfort within,
which, till now, I knew nothing of; also, as
my health and strength rctumctl, l histirred
me to furnish myself with evt-r'y thing that I
wanted, and make my way of living as rngulur
u I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was
cltietly employed in walking about with my
gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time,
as tt man that was gathering up his strength
after a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be
imagined how low I was, and to what wealt-
ness I was reduced. The application which
I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps
what had never cured an ague before; neither
can I recommend it to any one to practise, by
this experiment: and though it (IMI carry ofl'
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening
me; lbr I had frequent ctmvul<ions in my
nerves and limbs for some time: I learned from
it also this, in particular; that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pemicious thing
to my health that could be, especially in those
min: which came attended with storms and
hurricanes ofwind; for as the rain which cum:
in the dryseason was almost always accom-
panied with such storms.>> I found that this
rain was much more dangerous than the rain
which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above
ten months: all possibility of deliverance from
this condition seemed to be entirely taken from
me i and I firmly believed that no human shape
had ever set foot upon that place. Having
scarred my habitation, as I thought, fully to
my mind, I had a great desire to make a more
perfect discovery ofthe island, and to see what
other productions I might find, which I yet
know nothing of:

It wasonthe i5th ofJulythatI beganto
take a more particular survey of the island
itself. I went up the fint,an, as I

hinted, I brought my on .. I found,

more than a little brook running fir, very
fresh and good: but this being the dry season,
there was hardly any water in some parts of
it: at least, not any stream. 0n the banks of
this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and catered with
grass: and on the rising part: ofthcm, next to
the higher grounds, (where the water, as it
might be supposed, never endowed.) l hunt!
a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to
a very great and strong stall: and there were

. LIflA42

divers other plants, which I had no knowledge
of, or understanding about, and that might,
perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I
could not lindout. I searched for the cassava
root, which the Indians, in all that climate,
make their bread of; but I could find none.
I saw large plants of aloea, but did not under-
atand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but
wild; and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.
l contented myself with these discoveries for
this time; and came back, musing with myself
what course I might take to know the virtue
and goodness of any of the fruits or plants
which I should discover; but could bring it to
no conclusion: for, in short, I had made so
little observation while I was in the Brazils,
that I lzncw little ofthe plinta in the field; at
least, very little that might serve no to any
purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same
way again; and after going something farther
than I had gone the day before, I fourid the
hrooksnd the savannalts beginto cease,and
the country become more woody than before.
In this part I found difl'erent fruits; and parti-
cularly I found melons upon the ground, in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees:
the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were now just in
their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a
surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly
glad of them. but I was warned by my expe-
rience to eat sparingly of them: remembering
that when I was ashore in Barbary, tlteeating
of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who
were slaves there, by throwing them into
flutes and fevers. I fotmd, however, an excel-
lent use for these ; and that was, to cure
or dry thetnintheatm,andkeepthemasdried
grapes or raisins are ltept; which I thought
would he (as indeed they were) as wholesome
andasagreeabletoeat,whenno were

I spent all that evening there, and went not
back to tny habitatim; which, by the way,
was the first night, I I might say, I had lain
from hotel. Atnifiltook myfiratcontri-

that it looked like a planted garden. I de-
scended a little on the aide of that delicious
vale, surveying it with a secet kind ofplea-
sure, (though mixed with other aflicting

ts,) to think that this was ell my own;
that I was king and lord ofall this country in-
defeasibly, and had arigbt of possession; and,
it' I could convey it, I might have it in inherit-
anceascornpletely asany lord ofa manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa,-
trees, and , lemon, and citrou trees; but
all wild, and very few ' any fruit; at
least not then. However, the green limes that
I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but
very wholesome; and I mired their juice after-
wards with water, which made it Very whole-
aome, andvery cool and refreshing. I fotmd
nowI had btlineee enough, to gatherand carry
home; and I reaolvedto lay up a store, aswell
of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish
myself for the wet mam, whichl knew was
approaching. In order to this, I gathered a
great heapol'grapes in oneplece,s leeserheap
inanother place; and egreat parcel of lime'
and lemons in another place ; and, taking a few
ot'eaeh with me, I travelled homard; and
resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest
borne. Accordingly, having spent three duys in
this journey,l came home, (so I must nowcall
my tent and my cave:) but before I got thither,
the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the
fruits, and the weight of the juice, having
broken and bruised them, they were good liar
liule or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring onlya few.

The next day beingthe l9th, I went back,
having mademetwosrnallbaga tobringhome
my harvest; butI was surprised, when,coming
to my heap ol'grapea, which were so rich and
finewhen I gathered them, I foundthetn all
spread about, trod topieces, anddragged about,
some here, some there, and abundance eaten
and devoured. By this I concluded there were
some wild metres thereahouta which had

for religious exercise, prostrating myself on
the ground with the most serious humiliation,
confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his
righteous judgments upon me, and praying
to him to have mercy on me through Jesus
Christ; and having not. tasted the least refresh-
ment for twelve hours, even till the going down
ofthc sun. I then ate a biscuit and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as
I began it. I had all this time observed no
sabbath-day: for as at first I had no sense of
religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,
omit led to distinguish the weeks, by making a
longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-
daI. and so did not really know what any of
the daIs were: but now having cast up the
days, as aboIe, I found I had been there a
year; so I divided It into weeks. and set apart
:Ien' seIenth day for a sabbath: though I
found, at the end of my account, I had lost a
Il:II or too in my reckoning. A little after
this, my ink begihning to fail me. I contented
In_I self to use it more sparingly; and to write
down only the most remarkable eventsof my
hfe, without continuing a daily memorandum
ofother things.

The rainy season and the dry season began
now to appear regular to me, and I learned to
divide them so as to provide for them accord-
ingly; but I bought all my experience before I
had it; and what I am going to relate was
one of the most discouraging experiments that
I had made at all.

I haIe mentioned that I had saved the few
ears of barley, and rice, which I had so sur-
prisingly found spmng up, as I thought, of
themselves. I believe there were about thirty
stalksofricc, and about twenty of barley; and

new I thought it a proper time to sow it after
the rains- the sun being In its southem posi-
tion, going from me. Accordingly I dug a
piece of ground, as well as I could, with" my
IIooden spade; and dividing It into two pans,
I sowed my grain; but," I was sowing, it
casually occurred to my thoughts that I would
not sow it all at first, because I did not know
when "as the proper time for It; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a
handful of each: and it was a great comfort to
me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain
oftvhat I sowed this time came to any thing;
(hr the dry month following, and the earth
having thus had no rain after the seed was
aown, it had no moisture toassist its growth,

and never earneup atalltill thewetseasoa
had come again, and then it grew as it'it had
been but newly sown. Finding my first seed
did not grow, which I easily 8imagined was
from the drought, I sought for a moister piece
of ground to make another trial in: and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new hon-er, and
sowed the rest. of my seed in February, a lit-
tle before the vernal equinox. This having
the rainy month of March and April to water
it, sprung up very pleasantly, and \illdt'd a
veryg good crop; but having only part oftho
seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had,
I got but a small quantity at last. my IIholo
crop not anwunting to above half a peek of each
kind. But by this experiment I was made
masterof my business, and knew exactly when
was the proper time to sew: and that I might
expect two seedtimos, and two harvests, every
car.

y While this com was growing, I made a lit-
tle discovery, which was of use to me after-
wards. As soon as the rains were over, and
the weather began to settle, which was about
the month of November, I made a Iisit up the
country to my bower; II here, though I had not
been some months. yet I found all things just
as I left them. The circle or double hedge
that I had made was not only firm and entire,
but the stakes which I had cut out of some
trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out
and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usually shoots the first year after
lapping its head; but I could not tell what tree
to call it that those stakes were cut from. I
was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow; and I pntned Ihc-m,
and led them to grow as much alike as I could
and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure
they grew into in three years: so that, though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five
yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I
might now call them, soon covered it, and it
was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under
all the dry season. This made me resolve to
cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge
like this, in a semicircle round my wall. (I
mean that of my first dwelling.) which I did;
and placing the trees or stakes in a double
row, at about eight yards distance from my
first fence, they grew presently; and were at
first a fine cover to my habitation, and were
wards served for a defence also; as I shall
obsem' In its order.

might genenllyhe divided, not into sumer

could get for the purpose proved so brittle, thst
they would do nothing. It proved of excellent
edvantege to me now, that when I was a boy,
I used to take great delight in standing at e

lived, toeee them make their wicker-were ; and

pued with e hatchet to out down a quantity,

cayed, I made more; especth strongdeep
baskets, to place my com in, instead rt sacks,
when I shuddcome to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this dificulty, and em-
ployeda worldoftimeaboutit, Ibestirred
myself to see, if possible, how to supply two
other wants. I had no vessel to hold any
thing that was liquid, except two "allele,
which were almost full of rumgand some
glass bottles, some ofthe common size, and
others (which were case-bottles) square, for
the holding of waters, spirits, he. I had not
so much as potto boilany thing; excepts
greet kettle, which I saved out of thediip, and
which was toohigforcuch these I desired it,
viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by
itself. The second thing I would Iain have
had, was a t ipe; but it was impossi-
hle fix me to make one; however,l founda
contrivnnce lhr that too at last. I employed
myself in planting my second row of stakes or
piles, and also in this wicker-working, all the
lummcror dry season; when another bttsinesa
took me up moretimethnnitcould beima-
gined I could spare.

I mentioned before, tbntlhad a great mind
toseethewhole island; andthatIhadtravel-
led upthebroolr,and soon towhere I had
built my bower, and where I had an opening
quite to the sea, on the otherside of the island.
I now resolved to travel quite across to the
seashore, on that side: so taking my gun, a
hatchet, and my dog, and a. larger quantity of
powder andshot than usual ; with two biscuit-
caltee,andagreatbundiofraisinsin my
pouch, for my store; I began my journey.

fairly dcscried land, whether an island or con-
tinenl I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from W. to W. S. W. at a very
great distance; by my guess, it could not be
less than liken or twenty leagues 06'.

However, this was great encouragement to
me; and [foresaw that, in time, it would
please God to supply me with bread; and yet
here I was perplexed again; [or I neither knew
howto grind, or nuke meal ofmyoom, or
indeedhawtoclesn itandpanit; norit'rnade
into meal, how to make bread of it; and if
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake
it: thesethings being added to my desire of
having a good quantity for store, and to secure
amam supply, 1 reeolvednotto taste any
of this crop, but to preserve it all for need
against the next season; and, in the mean
time, teemployallmyatudyandhouraof
working to accomplish this great work of pro-
viding myrelfwith corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that new I worked for
my bread. It is a little wonderful, and what
I believe few people have thought much upon,
viz. the strange multitude of little things no-
cessary in the providing, producing, curing,
dressing, melting, andfinishing this moanicle
ofbread. I,thatwnsredncedtoamerestate
of nature, found this to my daily discourage-
ment,and was made more aensibleot' it every
hour, even after I had got thefirst handful of
seed-corn, which, as I have said, eameup tm~

This cotton to stttdyhowtoordor myfire,
aoastotnakeithurnaomepota. Ihadno
notion ofa kiln, such as the potter! burn in, or
ot' glazing them with lead, though I had some
lead to do it with; but I placed three large
pipltina and tvro or three in apile, one
upon another, and placed my firewood all round
it, with a heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the out-
aide, and upon the top, till I aawthe pots in
the inside redhot quite through, and observed
that they did not crack at all: when I saw
them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six hours, till I found oneol' them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mi with the clay
melted by the violence of heat, and would
haverun intoglass,il'lhadgoneon; sol
alaeked my tire gradually, till the pots began to
abate ot' the red colour; and watching them all
night, that I might not let the fire abate too
fast, inthe morning I had three very good, I
will not say handsome, pipltins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could he desired;
and one of them perfectly glazed with the run-
ning of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthenware for my use;
but 1 must needs aay,as to the shapes cl'them,
they were very indifi'erent, as any one may
suppose, as I had no way of making them but
as the cltildren make dirt piea, or as a woman
would make pies that never learned to raise
paste. No joy at a thing ot'so mean a nature
was ever equal tomine, when [found I had
made an earthen pot that would hear the fire;
and I had hardly patiencsto stay till thewa
cold, before I set one on the fireagain, with
some water in it, to boil me some meat, which
it did admirably well; and with a piece of a
kid I madesomeverygood hroth;thoughl
wanted oatmeal, and several otha ingredi-
ents requisiteto make it aogoodas Iwould
have had it been.

and ett' one as ' as we to stir,
I refindeldsit, and (edited it on the ol'tfii'de with
my axe and hatchet: and then, with the help
of tire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place
in it, as the lndiana in Brazil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy
pestle, or heater, ofthe wood called iron-wood;
and this I prepared and laid by against I had
my next crop of corn, when I proposed to my-
self to grind, or rather pound, my corn into
meal, to ntake my bread.

My next difficulty was to make a aieve, or
search, to dress my meal, and to part. it from
the bran and the husk, without which I did not
see it posaihle I could have any bread. This
was a most difficult thing, even but to think on;
for I had nothing like the neeemry thing to
make it; I mean fine thin canvass oratufi', to
search the meal through. Here I was at a
full stop for many months; nor did I really
know what to do; linen I had none lefl, but
what was mere rage; I had gnaw-hair, but
neither knew how to weave it nor npin it; and
had I known how, here were no tools to work it
with: all the remedy I fotmd for this was, at

brought them to the boat, resolving to try what
I could do: suggesting to myself, that if I could
but turn her down, and repair the damages she
had received, she would be a very good boat,
and I might venture to sea in her.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of
fruitless toil, and spent, I think, three or four
weeks about it: at last, finding it impossible
to heave her up with my little strength, I fell
to digging away the sand, to undermine her,
and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide her right iutho
fall. But when I had done this, I was unable
to stir her up again, or to get under her, much
less to move her forward towards the water;
so I was forced to giro it over: and yet,
though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture over the main increased,
rather than diminished, as the means for it
seemed impossible.

At length, I began to think tvhelher it was
not possible to make myself acanoe, or peria-
gua, such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or, as I might say, with-
out hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This
I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased
myself extremely with the idea of tuakingit,
and with my having much more convenience
for it than any ofthe Negroes or Indians : but
not at all considering the particular incon-
veniences which I lay undcr'morc than the In-
dians did, viz. the want ofharttls to move it into
the water when it was made, a difficulty much
narder for me to surmount than all the cruise-
quencns of want of tools could he to them: lhr
what could it avail me. if. tiller I had chosen
m_\'trct-, and with much trouble cut it down,
and might be able witlttny tools to hew and
dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hol-
low, so as to make a boat of it: if, after all
this, I must leave it just where I found it, and
was not able to launch it iu'o the waterfl

One would imagine, if I had had the least re-
flection upon tny mind of my circumstances
while I was making this boat, I should have im-
medialely lhoughthowI was to get it into the
sea: but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage in it, that I never once considered how
I should get it off the land : and it was really,
in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it
over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty-five
ratltomsot' land, where it lay, to set it afloat
in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like
a fool that ever man did, who had any of his
senses awake. I pleased tnyaelfwith the de~
sign, without determining whether I was ablo

to undertake it; not but that the ditheultyof
launching my boat came often into my head;
but! put a stop to my own inquiries into it,
by this foolish answer: Let us first make it; I
warrant I will find some way or other to get
it along when it is done.

This was a most preposterous method; but
the eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to
work I went. [felled a cedar tree, and I
question much whether Solomon ever had
such a one for the building of the Temple at
Jentsalem; it. was five feet ten inched diameter
at the lower part next the stump, and four feet
eleven inches diameter at the end oftwenty-two
feet, where it lessened, and then parted into
branches. It was not without infinite labour
that I tidied this tree; I was twenty days back-
ing and bowing at the bottom, and fourteen
more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it, cut ofl': ailer this, it
cost me a month to shape it anddub it too
proportion, and to something like the bottom
ofa boat, that it might swim upright as it ought
to do. It cost me near three months more to
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make
an exact boat of it: thisIdid, indeed, with-
out fire. by more mallet and chisel, and by the
dint of hard labour, till I had brought it tobe
a very handsome pcriagua, and big enough to
have Carried six-and-twenty men, and conse-
quently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.

"'hen I had gone through this work, I was
extremely delighted with it. The boat was
really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or
a periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you
may he sure; and there remained nothing but
to get it into the water; which, had I accom~
plishcd, I make no question but I should have
begun the maddest voyage, and the most un-
likely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water
failed me; though they cost me inexpressible
labour too. It lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first in-
convenience was, it was up hill towards the
creek. "fell, to take away this discourage-
ment, I resolved to dig into the surface of the
earth, and so make a dcclivity: this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of painsl'
(but who grudge pains that have their delt-
veranco in view 1) when this was worked
through, and this difficulty managed, it was.
still much the sante,t'ur I could no more stir
the canoe than [could the other boat. Then
I measured the distance of ground, and resale
red to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water
qttothc canoe, seeing Icottld notbring the
canoe down to the water. Well, I began this
work: and when I to enter upon it,
and calculate how deep it waste be dug, how
brood, how the M was to bethrown out, I
found by the number of hands I Itsd, having
none but my own,that it must have been ten
or twelve years belbre I could have
through with it; for the shore lay so high, that
at the upper end it must have been II least
twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with
great reluctaney, I was at. length obliged to
give over also.

This grieved me heartily; and MI saw,
though too late, the folly ofy beginning a work
before we count the cost, and before we judge
rightly of our own strengtht 050 through with' It.

In the middle ofthis work, I finished my
fourth year in this place, and kept my anniver-
sary with the some devotion, andwith as much
cotitfnrt as before; for, by a constant study and
serious applicetion to the word of God, and by
the assistance of his grace, I gained a did'erent
knowledge from what I had before; I enter-
tained ditl'erent notions of things; I looked
now upon the world as a thing remote, which
I had nothing to do with, no expectation from,
and, indeed, no desires about: in a. word, I
had nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely
to have; I thought it looked, as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz.as a place I
had lived in, but was come outof it; end well
might I say, as Ether Abraham to Dives, " Be-
tween me and thee is a. gulffix ."

In the first place. I was here removed from
all the wickedness of the world ; I_ had neither
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the
pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had
all that I was now capable of enjoying I wns
lord of the whole manor, or, if I pleased,I
might cell m If It' or emperor over the
whole countryystvhichm'I had possession of;
there were no rivals; I had no contpetitor,
none to dispute sovereignty or command with
me: I might have raised ahiploadings of corn,
butIhadnousel'orit; so] lot as little grew

timber enough to have built a fleet of ships;
andIhadgrapes. tohavemadewine,
or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded

couldtnaltenomorewe ofthern than lhrfuel,
andthatlhadnootheroecasionfixbutto
dress my food.

In a wonl, the nature and experienCe of
things dictated to me, upon jtnt reflection, that
all the good things of this world are of no fer-
ther good to us than for our use; and that
whatever we my heap up to give others, we
enjoy only as much as we can use, and no
more. The most covetous griping miner in
the world would have been cured of the vice
of covetousnes, if he had been in my case;
for 'I ed infinitely more than I knew
what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was lbr things which I had not, and
they were comparatively but trifles, though in-
deed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted
before, a parcel ofmoney, aswell gold as silver,
shout thirty-sis pounds sterling. Alas! there
the nasty, sorry, useless slut? lay: I had no
tnnnner of halite" for it; and I often thought
within myself, that I would have given a hand-
fulofitforagross oftobncoo-pipes,or for s.
hand-mill legrind my corn; nay, I would have
given it all for sixpenny worth of turnip and
carrot seed fiomEnglandmrfora handful of
pessandbenns,andaboltle of ink. Asit
wss,Ihod nottheleastsdvantagehyit,orbe-
nelit fiom it; but there it lay In a drawer, and
grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the
wet season; and ifI had had the drawer full
of diamonds, it had been the cams case,---they
had been ofno manner ofvalue to me, because
of no use.

I had now brought my state oflil'e to be
much more comfortable in itself than it was at
first, and much easier to my mind, as well as
to my body. I frequently sat down to meet
with thankfulness, and admired the hand of
God's providence, which had thus spread my
table in the wilderness: I learned to look more
upon the bright ttido of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I en-
joyed, rather than what I wanted: and this
gave me sometimes mach secret comforts, that
Icannote them;andwhichItaheno-

Another reflection was of gut II. to me.
anddouhtleas wouldbesotnanyonetlmt
should {all Into and: distress as mine was: and56

this was, to compare my present condition with
what I at first it would be; nay,witlt
what it would certainly have been, if the good
providence of God had not wonderfitlly ordered
the ship tobecastupneartotheahore,whero
I not only could come at her, but could bring
what I got out of her to the shore, for my
relief and comfort; without which, I had
wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence,
and gunpowder and shot for getting my food.

i spent whole hours, I may say whole days,
in representing to myself, in the most lively
colours, how I must have acted if I had got
nothing out of the ship. I could not have so
much as got any food, except fish and turtles;
and that, as it was long before I found any of
them, I must have perished; that I should have
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage;
that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it,
or part tlte flesh from the skin and the bowels,
or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my
teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of
the goodness of Providence to me, and very
thankful for my present condition, with all its
hardships and misforltmes; and this part also
I cannot but recommend to the reflection of
those who are apt, in their misery, to say, In
any affliction like mine? Let them consider
how much worse the cases of some people are,
and their case might have been, if Providence
had thought fit. .

I had another reflection, which assisted me
also tocomlhrt my mind with hopes; and this
was, comparing my present condition with what
I had deserved, and had therefore reason to
expect from the hand of Providence. I had
lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the
knowledge and fearofGod. Ihadbeenwcll
instructed by my father and mother; neither
had they been wanting to me, in their endea-
vours to infuse an early religious awe of God
into my mind, accuse of my duty, and what
the nature and endofmy being required ofme.
But, alas! falling early into the seafaring life,
which, of all lives, isthe ntoetdectitute of the
that ofGod, though his terrors are always be-
fore them; I say, fallingearly into the seafaring
life, and into seafaring company, all that little
sense of religion which I had entertained was
laughed out ofme by my tncasmates; by a
hardened despising of dangers, and the views
ofdcath, which grew habitual to me; by my
long absence fiom all manner of 'ties

ADVENTURES 01-" ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Sovoidwaalofeverything thatwas good,
orofthe lesstscnseot'whatlwas,orwasto
be, that in the ateot deliverance-5 I enjoyed,
(such as my escape from Sallee, my being taken
up by the Portuguese master of a ship, my be-
ing planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving
the cargo from England, and the like,) I never
had once the words, Thank God,so much as
on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the great-
est distress had I so much as a thought to pray
to him,orsomuch as to say, Lord, have mercy
upon me! no, nor to mention the name of
God, unless it was to swear by, and blas-
pheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for
many months, as I have already observed, on
account of my wicked and hardened life past;
and when I looked about me, and comidcred
what particular provident" had attended me
since my coming into this place, and how God
httd dealt bountifttlly with rum--had not only
punished me less than my iniquityhad deserved,
but had so plentifully provided liir me,--lhis
gave me great hopes that my repentance was
accepted, and that God had yet mercies in
store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind
up. not only to a resignation to the will ol'God
in the present disposition of my circumstances,
but even to a sincere thankfulness lbr my con-
dition; andthat I, who was yet a living man,
ought not to complain, seeing I had not the
due punishment of my sins; that Ienjoyed so
many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place. that I ought never more
to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to
give daily thanks for that daily bread, which
nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been
fed by a miracle, even as great as that of feed-
ing Elijah by ravens; my, by a long series of
miracles: and that I could hardly have named
a place in the uninhabitable part of the world
where Icouldhave been cast mete my Ids
vantage; a place where, as I had no society,
which was my aflliction on one hand, so I linmd
no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers,
to threaten my life; no venomous or poisonous
creatures, which I might feed on lo my hurt;
no savages, to murder and devour me. In a
word, as my life was a life of sorrow one tray,
Io it was a life ot'mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life ofcornfort, but to make
myself sensible of God's goodness to me, and
careovermo in this condition; and alier Idid'

in minute down the days of the month on which
auv remarkable thing happened to me: and,
lint. l'." minng up time. put, I remember
that there was a strange concurrence of days
in the various providence! which befall me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously in-
cliuexl to observe days as fetal or fortunate. I
might have had reason to have looked upon
with a great deal of curioaity.

First. I had obaerved, that the same day

ing; and thus I every now and then took a
little voyage upon the sea, but never went for
out, nor Gtr from the little creek. At last, be-
ing eager to view the circumference of my little
kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise; and ac-
cotdingly, I victualled my ship for the voyage,
putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should
rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen
pot full of parched rice, (a food I ate agree!
deal of,) a little bottle of rum, halt'a goat, and
powder and shot for killing more, and two large
watchooats, of those which, as I mentioned
before, I had saved out ofthe seamen's chests;
these I took, one tolie upon, and the other to
cover me in the night.

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth
year of my reign, or my captivity, which you
please, that I set out on this voyage, sndI
lound it much longer than I expected; for
though the island iLsell' was not very large, yet
when I came to the out side of it, I found a
great ledge ol'roelts lie out about two leagues
Into the sea, some above water', some under
it: and beyond that a shoal ol'ssnd, lying dry
half a league more, so that I was obliged to
go a great way out to sea to double the point.

When lint I discovered them, I was going
to give over my enterprise, and come back
again, not knowing how far it might oblige me
to go out tons, and, above all, doubting how I
should getbaek again; so! cemetban anchor;
for I had made me a kind of an anchor with a
piece of a broken grappling which I got out
of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun an
went on shore, climbing up on a hill, which
seemed to overlook that point, where lssw the
full extent <<fit, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea Eom that hill where
I stood, I perceived a strong, and indeed a
most. furious current, which ran to the east, and
even came close to the point; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be
some danger, that when Ieame into it, 1
might becarried out to sea by the strength of
it, and not be able to make the island again:
and, indeed, had I not got first upon this hill,
I believe it would have been so; for there was
the some current on the other side the island,
only that it set olfat a farther distance, and I
saw there was a strong eddy under the shore;
so I had nothing to debut to get out of the
2;: current, and I should presently be in an

y.

I lay here, however, two days, because the
wind blowing pretty fi'esh at E. S. E. and '
that being just contrary to the said current,
made a great breach of the sea upon the point ;
'50 that it wasnot safe for me to keep too close
totheshore, for the breach, nor togo too far
03', because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind
hav' abated over night, the sea was calm,
and ventured: but I am a warning-piece
again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was
not even my boat's length from the shore, but

myself over for lost; for u the current was on

leagues' distance they must join again, and
then I was irrecoverably gone; nordid I see
any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no
prospectbeforemebutofpefishing,notbythe
sea, for that was calm enough, but ofstarving
for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on
the shore," big almostas I could lih,and
hadtosed it intothe boat; and Ihadngreat

AndnowIsawhow itwasfitrthetno-

it, with eager wishes: 0 hsppydesert! said I,

preached myself with my unthunltful temper,
and how I had repined at my solitary condi-
tion; and now what would I give to be on
shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till it is illustrated

JustasI hadsetnry mastand sail,and the

was, and ltow gladly I put my boat into the
stream of this eddy; and the wind abo fresh-
ening. how gladly I spread my sail to it, run-
ning cheerfully before the wind, and with a
strong tide or eddy under foot.

This eddy untried me about a league in my
way back again, directly towards lhe island,
but about two leagues more to the northward
than the current which carried me away at
first: so that when I came near the island.l
found myself open to the northern shore of it,
thlt is to any, the other end of the island,
opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a
league of way by the help of this current or
eddy,I fotrnditwas spent,andserved me no
farther. However, I found that being between
two great currents, viz. that on the south side,
which had hurried me away, and that an the
north, which lay about a league on theother
side; I say, between these two, in tho walte
of the island, I found tlte water at least mill,
and running noway: and having still a breeze
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly
lbr the island, notmnltitrg such fresh
way as I did bellire.

About four o'clodt in the evening, being
then within a of the island, I found the

near a year, lived a very sedate, retired life,
as you may well suppose; and my thoughts
being very much composed, as to my condi-
tion, and fully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I
lived really very happily in all things. except
that of society.

I improved raysclfin this time in all the
mechanic exercises which my necessities put
me upon applying myself to; and I believe I
could, upon occasion, have made a very good
carpenter, especially considering how few tools
I had .

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected
perfection in my earthenware, and contrived
well enough to make them with a wheel, which
I found infinitely easier and better; because
I made things round and shapeable, which be-
fore were filthy things indeed to look on. But
I think I was never morevain of my own perk
formance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than lbr my being able to make a tobacco-
pipe; and though it was a very ugly clumy
thing when it. was (lune, and only burned red,
like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was ex-
ceedingly comforted with it, for I had been
always used to smoke: and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not
thinking that there was tobamo in the island;

ADVENTURES OI" ROBINSON CRUSOE.

and afterwards, when I searched the ship
again,I could not come at any pipes at all.

In my wickerhwarc also I improved much,
and made abundance of necessary baskets, as
well as my invention showed me; though not
very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things
up in, or fetching things home. For example,
if I killed a goat abroad. I could hang it up in
a tree, day it, dress it, and cut it in pieces,
andbrilg it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs,
and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
enough for me, and bring them home in a
basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also
large deep baskets were the receivers of my
corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it
was dry, and cured,and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated
considerably; this was a want which it was
impossible for me to supply, and I began seric
ously toconsider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I
should do to kill any goats. I had, as is ob-
served, in the third year of my being here,
kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I
was in hopes of gettinga he-goat: but I could
not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid
gretv an old ; and as I could never find in
my heart tokill her, she died at last of mere age.

Berna now in the eleventh year of my re-
sidence, and, as Ihave said, my ammunition
growing low, I set myself to study some art to
trap and snare the , to see whether I
could not catch someof them alive; and parti-
cularly, I wanted a she-goat. great with young.
For this purpose, I made snares to hamper
them; and I do believe they were more than
once taken in them; but my tackle was not
good, for I had no wire, and I always found
them broken, and my bait devoured. At
length I resolved to try a pitfall: so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where
I hadobserved the goats used to feed, and
over those pits I placed hurdles, of my own
making too, with a great weight upon them;
and several times I put ears of barley and dry
tree, without setting the trap; and I could

easily perceive that the goats had gone in and
eaten up the corn, for I could see the marks
of their feet. At length I set three traps in
one night, and going the next morning, I
found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone; this was very discouraging. How-
ever, I altered my traps: and, not to trouble
you with particulars, going one morning to
seemy traps,Ifound inoneofthema largo
old lie-goat, and in one of the others three
kids, a male and two females.

Astoths old one, I knew not what todo
withhim;hewas eofierce, I dun-st notgo
into the pit tohim; that isto say, to goabout
to bring him away alive, which was what I
wanted: I could have killed him, but that was
not my business, normtrld itanswermy end;
so! even lethimout,andheran away, lei!
he hsdheenfrigbtenedoutot'hiswits. But!
bad forgot then, what I had learned ailerwards,
that hunger will tame a lion. I" had let him
stay there three or four days without food, and
then have mrried him some water to drink,
and then a little eorn, he would have been as
tame as one of the kids: fir they are mighty
sagaeious, tractable creatures, where they are
well used. However, (hr the In I let
him go, knowing no better at that time: then
I went to the three kids, and taking themone
by one, I lied them with strings together, and
with some dificulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed;
but throwing Ihetnsome sweet corn, it tempted
them,andthey be gant.obetarne Andnow
I found that If I expected to supplymyselfwith
goat's flesh when I had no powder or shot left,
breeding some up tame was my only way;
when, perhaps, I m ht have them about my
house like a flock sheep. But then it no
curred to me, that I must keep the lame from
the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up: and the only yway for this
was, to have some enclosed piece of ground,
we" fenced, either with hedgcp or pale, to keep
them In so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break' In.

This was a great undertaking for one pair
of hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute
necessity for doing it, my first work was to
find out a proper piece of ground, where there
was likely to he herbage for them to eat, water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.

Those who Imderstand such enclosures will
think I had very little eontrivanee, when I
pitched upon a place very proper for all these,
(being a plain open pieeeol' meadow land, or
savannah, as our people call it in the western
colonies,) which had two or three little drills
of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast,
when" I shall tell them, I began my enclosing

This was acting with some prudence, and I
wenttoworkwith . Iwasaboutthree

This answered my end; and inaboutayear

little pens to drive them into, to take them as
Iwanted,ondgatesotttofonepieceofground

Butthiswasnotall; fornowI notonly had
goats' flesh to feed on when I pleased, but
milk too; a thing whidI, indeed, in the be-
ginning, I did not so much as think of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was
really an agreeable surprise: for now I setup
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two
of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates
even naturally how to make use of it, so I,
that had never milked a cow, much less a goat,

here in my way thither; for I used frequently
to visit my boat; and I kept all things
about, or belonging to her, in very good
order: sometimes I went out in her to di-
vert myself, but no more hazardous voyages
would I go, nor scarce ever above a stone's
cast or two from the shore, I was so appre-
hensive of being hurried out of my knowledge
againby the currents or winds, or any other
accident. But now! come to a new scene
of my life.

 

SECTION XVII.

UNEIPECTSD ALARM AND CAUSE NR APPREHENSION.--HE PORTIFIES HIS ABODI'.

[1- happened one day, about noon, going
towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised
with the print of a man's naked foot on the
shore, which wu very plain to be seen in the
sand. I stood like one thumlerstruck, or as if
I had seen an apparition; I listened, I looked
round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see
any thing; I went up to a rising ground, to
look farther; I went up the shore, and down
the shore, but it was all one; I could see no
other impression but that one. I went to it
again to see if there were any more, and to
observe if it might not be my fancy; but there
was no room for that, for there was exactly the
print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a
foot: how it me thither I knew not, nor
could I in the least imagine; but, alter innu-
merable fluttering thoughts. like a man perk
fcctly confused and out of myself. I came
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we
say, the I went on. but terrified to the
last degree: looking behind me at every ttvo
or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree,
and faneying every stump at a distance to be
a man. Nor is it ponible to describe how
many various shapes my afi'righted imqina--
tion represented things tome in, how many wild
ideas were found every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies
came into my thoughts by the way.

When I tame to my castle, (for so I think I
called it ever after this,) I fled into it like one
pursued; whether I went over by the ladder,
as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which I had called adoor, I cannot re-
member; no, nor could I remember the next
morning; for never frightened hare fled to

cover, or fox to earth, with more tenor of mind
than I to this retreat.

I slept none that night; the farther I was
from the occasion of tny fright, the greater my
apprehensions were; which is smoothing con-
trary to the nature of such things, and espe-
cially to the usual practice of all creatures in
fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own
frightful ideas of tho thing, that I formed no-
thing but dismal imaginations to myself, even
though I was now a great way of? it. Some-
times I fancied it must be the Devil, and rea-
son joined in with me upon this supposition;
(hr how should any other thing in human shape
come into the place? "r'ltcre was the vessel
that brought them? \Vhat marks were there
of any other footsteps? And how was it pos-
sible a man should come there 1 Bill then to
think that Satan should take human shape upon
him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print
of his foot behind him, and that even litr no
purpose too, for he could not be sure I should
see it,---lhis wu an amusement the other way.
I considered that the Devil might. have found
out abundance of other ways to have terrified
me than this of the single print of a foot; that
as I lived quite on the other side of the island,
he would never have been so simple as to
leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
sand to one whether I should ever sec it or not
and in the sand too, which thefirst surge of the
sea, u a high wind, would have defaced
entirely: all this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself, and with all the notions we
usually entertain 0f the subtlety of the Devil.

Abundance of such things as these assistedDiscovering a foot-print.--p. 66.

ppreheutons of Its be-

ing the Devil; and I presently concluded then,
that it must be some more dangerous creature,
viz. that it must be some of the saw of the
main land over against me, who had wandered
out to sea in their canoes, and either driven
by the currents or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were
gone away again to sea; being as loath, per-
haps, to have stayed in this desolate island as
I would have been to have had them.

\Vhile these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thoughts that
I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that
fime, or that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that some
inhabitants had been in the place, and per-
haps have searched farther for me: then terri-
ble thoughts racked my imagination about
their having found my boat, and that there
were people here; and that if so, I should cer-
tainly have them come again in greater num-
bers, and devour me; that if it should happen
so that they should not find me, yet they
would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn,
and carry away all my flock of tame goats,
and I should perish at last for more want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope,
all that former confidence in God, which was
founded upon suchwonderfiilesporience as I had
had of his goodnes, as if he that had fed me
by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his
power, the provision which he had made for
me by his goodness. I reproached myself with
at! laziness, that would not sow any more com

one year than would just serve me till the next
season, asif no accident would intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the
ground; and this I thought sojust a reproof,
that] resolved for the future to have two or
three years' corn beforehand; so that whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of
bread.

How strange a chequenwork of Providence
is the life of man! and by what secret dill'erent
springs are the affections hurried about, as
different circumstances present! Today we
love what tomorrow we hate; today we seek
what tomorrow we shun; today we desire
what tomorrow we fear, nay, even tremble at
the apprehensions of; this was exemplified in
me, at this time, in the most lively manner
imaginable; for I, whose only aflliction was
that I seemed banished from human society,
that I was alone, circumscribed by the bound-
less ocean,cut oii' from mankind, and condemned
to what I called silent life; that I was as one
whom heaven thought not worthy to be num-
bered among the living, or to appear among the
rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of
my own species would have seemed to me a
raising me from death to life, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, nextto the supreme
blessing of salvation,could bestow; I say, that
I should now tremble at the very apprehensions
ofseeing amen, and was ready tosink into the
ground at but the shadow-or silent appearance
of a man's having set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and
it afforded me a great many curious specula~68

liens allerwsrds, when I had a little recovered
my first surprise. I considered that this was
the station of life the infinitely wise and good
providence of God had determined for me;
that as Icauld not foresee whstthe ends of
divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was
his creature, had an undoubted right, by crea-
tion, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as
he thought fit; andwho, as I was acreature
that had offended him, had likewise a judicial
right to condemn me to what punishment be
thought fit; and that it was my part to submit
to hear his indignation, became I had sinned
against him. I then reflected, that as God,
who was not only righteous, but omnipotent,
had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me,
sohe was ableto deliver me: that if he did
notthink fit to do so, it was my unquestioned
duty to mign myself absolutely and entirely
to his will; and, on the other hand, it was
my duty also to hope in him. pray to him, and
quietly to attend the dictates and directions of
his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours,
days, nay, I may say, weeks and months; and
one particular effect of my cogitalions on this
occasion I cannot omit: One morning early,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about
my danger from the appearances of savages, I
found it discomposed me very much; upon
which these words of the Scripture came into
my thoughts, "Call upon me in the day of
trouble,md I will deliver thee, and thousltalt
glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out
of my bed, my heart was not only comforted,
but I was guided and encouraged to pray eu-
neatly toGod for deliverance: when I had done
praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it
to road, the first. words that presented to me
were, " Wait on the Lord, and be ofgood
cheer, and he shall hen thy heart; wait,
I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to es-
press the comfort this gave me. In answer, I
thankfullylaid downthebook,andwssnomore
Ifd' at least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, appro-
hensions, and reflections, it came into my
thoughts one day, that all this might be amero
chimera ofmy own, and thatthis lbotmightbe

andIbegan to persuade myself it wasall a

lost, this was only the print ofmy own foot, I
had played the part of those fools who try to
make stories of spectre: and apparitions, and

New I began to take courage, and to peer
abroad again, for I had not stirred nutof my
castle for three days and nights, so that I he
(an to starve for provisions; for I had little or
nothing within doors but some barley cakes
and water: then I knew that my goals wanted
to be milked too, which usually was my even-
ing diversion; and the poor matures were
in great pain and inconvenience for want of it;
and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them,
and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet,
and that! might be truly said to start at my
own shadow, I began tn go abroad again, and
went to mycountry home to milk my flock: but
to see with what fear I went forward, how
often I looked behind me, how I was ready,
every now and then, to lay down my basket,
and run for my life, it would have made any one
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience,
orthat I had beenlately most terribly frightened ;
and so, indeed, I had. However, as I went
down thus two or three days, and having seen
nothing, I began to be alittlc bolder, and to
think there was really nothing in it but my
own i ination; but I could not persuade
myself fully of this till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and
measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be as-
sured itwas myown foot: but when I came
to the place, first, it appeared evidently to me,
that when I laid up my boat, I could not pos-
sibly he on shore any where thereabout: se
condly, when I came to measure Ihs mark with
my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a
greatdeal. Both these things filled my head
with new imagination, and gave me the va-
pours agaio to the highest degree, so that I
shook with cold like one in an ague; and I
went home again, filled with the belief that
some man ormen had been on shore there;
or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and

whuthe two ladders were taken down,no man

ThusI tooltallthe measum humanpru-

foresaw nothing at that time more then my

While this was doing ,I was not altogether

For this purpose, alter long oonsideration,I
could thinkof but two ways to preserve them:

I mutant-rt" went to work with this
piece of ground, and in less than a month's
timeI had so fenced it round, that my (lock,
or herd, call it which you please, who were not
so wild now as at first they might be supposed
to he, were well enough secured in it: so,
without any farther delay, I removed ten young
she-goats, and two he-goats to this piece; and
when they were there, I continued to perfect
the fence, till I had made it assecure as the
other; which, however, I did at more leisure,
andittoolt nteuptnore time byagreatdeal.
All this labour I was at the expense of purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the

which nature gave me to those hellish wretches
was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them
as of seeing the Devil himself. I did not so
much as go to look after my boat all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another ;
for I could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the other boat round the
island to me, test I should meet with some of
these creatures at sea: in whiCh if I had hap-
pened to have fallout into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had
that I was in no danger of being discovered by
these people, began to wear otl' my uneasiness
about them; and I began to live just in the
same com manneras before; only tvith
this difference, that I used more caution, and
kept my eyes more about me, than I did bcthre,
lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly, I was more mutious of firing
my gun. lest any of them being on the island
should happen to hear it. It was therefore a
very good providence to me that I had fur-
nished myselfwith a tame breed of goats, and
that I had no need to hunt any more about the
woods, or shoot at. them; and if I did catch
any of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before: so that for two
years after this, I believe I never fired mygun
once on, though I never went out without it;
and, which was more, as I had saved three
pistols out of the ship, I always carried them
out with me, or atleast two of them, sticking
them in my goat's-skin belt. I also fttrbished
up one of the great outlasses that I had out of
the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also:
so that I was now a most formidable fellow to
look at when I went abroad, if you add to the
ibrtner description of myself, the particular of
two pistols, and a great broadaword hanging
at my side in a belt, but without a seabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for
some time. I seemed, excepting these cautions,
to be reduced to my former calm sedate way
of living. All these things tended to show
me, more and more, how far my condition
wasfrom being miserable, compared to some
others; nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how
little repining there would be among mankind
at any condition of life, if people would rather
compare their condition with those that were
worn, in order to be thankful, than be always
comparing them with those which are better,
to assist their murmurings and complainings.

A: in my present condition there are not
really many things which I wanted, so, indeed

ADVENTURES OII' ROBINSON 0110503.

I thought that the fright: I had been in about
these savage wretches, and the concern I had
been in for my own preservation, had taken of
the edge of my invention for my own conve-
niences; and I had droppeda good design,
which I had once beat my thoughts too much
upon, and that was, to try if I could not make
some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer. This was really a
whimsical thought, and Ireproved myself often
for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw
there would be the want of several things ne-
cessary to the making my beer, that it would
be impossible for me tosupply: as, first, casks
to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as
I have observed already, I could never corn-
pass: no, though I spent not only many days,
but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but
to no purpose. In the next place, I had no
hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it
work, no copper orkettle to make it boil; and
yet, with all these things wanting. I verily be-
lieve, had not the frights and terrors I was in
about the savages intervened, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it topass too;
for I seldom gave any thing over without ac-
complishing it, when once I had it in my head
tobegin it. But my invention now ran quite
anotltcry'ay ; for, night. and day, I could think
of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel, bloody enter-
tainment, and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would take
up a larger volume than this "hole work is
intended to be, to set down all the contrivances
I hatched, or rather hrooded upon, in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or
at least frightening them so as to prevent their
coming hither any more: but all this was ah-
ortivc ; nothing couldbc posible to take efi'ect,
unless I was to be there to do it myself: and
what could one man do among them, when
perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows
and arrows, with which they could shoot as
tructoamukaslcould with my gun? .
Sometimes [thought of digging a halo under
thc place where they made their fire, and put-
ting in five orsix pounds of gunpowder, which
when they kindled their fire, would conse-
quently take fire, and blow up all that was near
it: but as, in the first place, I should be utt-
willing to waste so much powder upon them,
my more being now within the quantity of one
barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going
off at any certain time, when it might surprise
them; and, at best, that it would do little more
than just blow the tire about their ears, and
fright them, but not suficient tomshe them
finsketheplace: soIlaiditaside; andthen
propoecdthatl wouldplacomyselfin ambush
in some convenient place, with my three guns
all doubleoIoaded, and, in the middle of their
bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should he sure to kill or wound perhaps two or
three at every shot; and then falling in upon
them with my three pistols, and my sword, I
made no doubt but that if there were twenty
Ishould kill them all. This fincy pleased
my thoughts for some weeks; and I was so
hill of it, that I oflen dreamed of it, and somee
times that [was just going to let fly at them
in my sleep. I went so for with it in my
imagination, that l employed myself several
days to find out proper places to put myself
in amhuscede, as I said, to watch for them;
and I went fi-equetitly to the place itself, which
was now grown more familiar to me but
while my mind was thus filled with thoughts
of revenge, and a bloody putting twenty or
thirty of them to the award, as I may call it,
the horror! hadsttheplace,and atthesigmls
of the barbarous wretchea devouring oneano-

thor, abetted rny malice. Well, at length, I
found a place in the side of the hill, where I
was satisfiedI might securely wait till I saw
any of their boats coming: and might then,
evenbefore tlieywould be ready to comeon
shore, convey myself, unseen, intosome thick-
ets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow
large enough to conceal Ine entirely; and
there I might sit and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads,
when they were so close together as that it
would honest to itn ible that 1 should miss
my shot, or that I could fail wotmding three or
lhur of them at the first shot. Inthis place,
then, I resolved tons my design; and, accord-
ingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordi-
nary fowlingpiece. The two muskels I yloaded
with sbrace of slugs each, and four or five
smaller hullus, about the size of pistol-bullets;
and the fowlingpiece I loaded with near a
handfulof swan-shot of the largest size: I also
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each;
and in this posture, well provided with sm-
munition for a second and third charge, I pm

myse lffor my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my de-
sign, and, in my imagination, put it in prac-
tice, I continually made my tour every mom-
ing up to the top of the hill, which was from
my castle, as I called it, about three miles,
or more,toseeiflcmiltlobserve anyboats
upon the sea, coming near the island,"
standing over towards it: but I began to tire

73

et'this hard duty,atterI had, fortwoerthies
months, constantly kept my watch, but came
always heck without any discovery; there
having not, in all that time, been the least
appearance, not only on or near the shore, but
on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or
glasses could reach every way.

As long as Ikept my daily tour to the hill
to look out, so long alsoI kept up thevigour
ofmy design, ands my spirits seemed to be
all the while his suitable form for so outra-
geous an execution as the killing twenty or
thirty naked savages, for an od'ence which I
had not at allentercd intoa diacnssionot'in
my thoughts, any farther than my passions

and, consequent y, were ,

things, and receive such dreadful customa,as
nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by
Heaven, and actuated by some hellish dege-
neracy, could have run them into. But now,

When I cemidered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong
in it: thatthesepeoplewcrcnotmutdereiain
the sense that I had before condemned them74

in my thoughts, any more than those Chris-
tians were murderers who often put to death
theprisonerstakeninbattle; ormore fre-
quently, upon many occasion, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms
and submitted. In the next place, it occurred
to me, that although the usage they gave one
another was thus brutish and inhtlnan, yet it
was really nothing to me; these people had
done me no injury: that ifthey attempted me,
or! saw it necmary, for my immediate pre-
semtion, to fell upon them, something might
be said for it; but thatI was yet outd'their
power, and they really had no knowledge of
me, and uently no design upon me;
andthercforeiteould notbe justforme to fall
uponthern: thattbiswouldjustify theconduct
of the Spaniards in all their barbarities prac-
tised in America, where they destroyed mil-
lions of these le: who, however they were
idolaters and barbarians, and had several
bloody and barbarous rites in their am,
such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols,
were yet, as tothe Spaniards, very innocentpeo-
ple; and that the rooting them outof the country
is spoken of with the utmost abhorrenee and
deleslntion byeven the Spaniards themselvesat
this time, and by all other Christian natioru in
Europe, as a mere butchery, a Moody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either
to Godor man; and for which the very name
of a Spaniard is reckoned to he frijtful and
terrible to all le of humanity, or of Chris-
tian compassion; as if the kingdomof Spain
were particularly eminent for the produce of
s. race of men who were without principles of
tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to
the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark
of generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a
pause,andtoakindofafull stop; nndIbe-

but that ifIweredisoevored andattafied
them, I knew my duty. On the other band,
argued with myself, that this really was the
way not to deliver , but entirely to ruin
and destroy myself; for unless! wassure to
killeveryone thatnotonlyshouldbeonshore

to tell their country-people what had happened,
they would come over again by to
revenge the death ofrheir fellows, and I should
only bring upon myself n certain destruction,
which, at present, I had no manner of occasion
for. Upon the whole,I concluded, that neither
in principle nor in policy, I ought, one way or
other, to concern myself in this afi'air: that my
business was, by all possible means, to con-
cesl myself from them, and not to leave the
least signal to them to guess by that there were
any living creannes upon the island, I mean of
human shape. Religion joined in with this
prudential resolution; and l was contineed
now, many ways, that l. was perfectly out of
my duty when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent crea-
tures,!meaninnocentss to me. Aston>>
aimes they were guilty of towards one sno-
ther, I had nothing to do with them; they
were urinal, and I ought to leave them to

doing or not doing any thing that presented, or
going this way or that way, I never failed to
obey the secret dictate; though I knew noother
reason for it than that such apressure, or such
a hint, hungupon my mind. I could give many
examples of the success of this conduct in the
course of my life, but more especially in the
latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy
island; besides many occasions which it is
very likely I might have taken noticeof, if I
had seen with the same eyes then that I see
with now. But it is never too late to be wise;
and I cannot but advise all considering men,
whose lives are attended with such extraor-
dinary incidents as mine, or even though not
so extraordinary, not to slight such secret inti-
mations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligence they wilL That I
shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot awount
for; but certainly they are a proof of the con-
verse of spirits, and a secret communication
between those embodied' and those unembo-
died, and such a proof as can never be with-
stood; of which I shall have ocusion to give
some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary raideuee in this dis-
'mal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think
it strange if I confess that these anxieties,
these constant dangers I lived in, and the con-
cernthatwasnowuponme,put anendto all
invention, and to all the oontrivances that I
had laid for my future accommodations and
conveniences. I had the care of my safety
more now upon my hands than that ofmy food.
Icared not todrive a nail,orchop a stiekof
wood now, {hr fear the noise I might make
should be heard; much less would 1 fire a gun,
for the same reason: and, above all, I was
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in
the day, should betray me. For this reason I
removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipea,&c.
into my new apartment in the woods; where,
after I had been some time, I found, to my
unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and
where, I dare say, no savage. had he been at

and yet I could not live there without baking

the other services for which fire was
wanting, without danger of unoke. But this
is by the by :--'While I was cutting down some
wood here, I perceived that behinda very thick
branch oflow hrushwood, or tn'tderwood, there
was akindofhollow place: Iwaacurious to
look in it, andgetting with difliculty into the
mouth ofit, I found itwaa pretty large: lhatis
to say, suficient fir me to stand upright in it,
and perhaps another with me: but I must con<
fesstnyou thatlmade morehaste outthanI
did in, when, looking farther into the place,
and which was perfectly dark, I saw two
broad shining eyes of some creature, whether
devil or man I knew not, which ttvinklcd like
two stars ; the dim light from the cave's mouth
shining directly in, and making the reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered my-
self, and began to call myselfa thousand fools,
and to think, that be that was afraid to see the
devil was not fit tolire twenty years in an island
all alone: and that I might well think there
was nothing in this care that was more flight-
ful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my
courage, I took up a lirebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick flaming in my band; I
had not gone three steps in, but I was almost
as much frightened as I was before; for I
heard a very loud nigh, like that of a man in
some pain, and it was followed by a broken
noise,asofwords halfexpremedmnd then a
deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was in-
deed struck with such a surprise, that it put
meintoacold sweat; and ifIhad had ahat
on my head, I will not answer for it, that my
hair might not have lifted it oti'. But still
plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and
encouraging myself a. little with considering
that the power and presence of God was every
where, and was able to protect me, upon this
I stepped forward again, and by the light of
the firebrand, holding it up a little over my
head,Isawlyingonthe amoetmon-

and it may not be amiss for all people who shall
meet with my story, to make this jua ohseru

course of our lives, the evil which in itself we
seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of our deliver-
nnoe, by which alone we an be raised gain
from the aflictian we are fallen into. I could
give many examples of this in the course of
my unaceountoblelifo; hut in nothing was it
more partitatlarly remarkable than in the cirh
cumstances of my last years of solitary resi-
dence in this island.

 

SECTION XX.

ANOTHER VlS'tI'l| OF THE SAVAGES.--ROBINSON SEES THEM D'I'CIRG.--PER-
CEIVES THE ""120! OF A VESSEL.

IT was now the month of December, as I
said above, in my twenty-third year; and this,
being the southem solstice, (for winter I cannot
call it,) w the particular time of my harvut.
and required my being pretty much abroad in
the fields: when going out pretty early in the
morning. even before it was thorough daylight,
I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of
about two miles, towards the end of the island
where I had observed some savages had been,
as before; and not on the other side, but, to my

afiliction, it was on my side of the island.

I Ins indeed terribly surprised at the sight,
and stopped short within my grove, not daring
to goout,lestl mighthenn'priaed; and yet I
nad no more within, from the apprehen-
siona I had that if these savages, in rambling
over the island, should find my eomstanding
or wt,or any of my works and improvements,
they would immediately condude that there
were people in the place, andwould then never
giveovertilltheyhadfound meant. In this
extremity, I went back directly to my castle,
pulled uptheladderafierme, andmade all things
withoutlools as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting my-
selfinaposttne ofdefenoe:1 loadedall my

moon, as I called them, that is to say, my
muskets, which were mounted upon my new
fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to
defend myself to the last gasp; not forgetting
seriotsly to commend myself to the divine pro-
tection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me outof the hands of the barbarians. I con-
tinued in this posture about two hours; and
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had nospies to send out. After
sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should
do in this, I was not able to bear sitting in
' auyl er: so netting up my adder
me of tit? hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling
the ladderup afier me, Iaetitupagninand
mounted to the top of the hill: and pulling
out my perspective glass, which I had taken on
purpooe, I laid rnedown listen mybelly on
theground,andhepnto|ookfortheplaee. I
presently found there were no less than nine
naked savages, sitting round a small firethey
had mde,not rowan-them, firtheyhadno
need of that, the weather being extremely hot,
hut,asIsupposed,todresssomeoftheirhar-
barousdietofhumanflesh,whichtheyhad
brought with them, whether alive or dead I
wuld not tell.
 

They had two canoes with mom, which
they had hauled up upon the shore; and as it
was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to
wait for the return of the flood to go away
again. It is not easy to imagine what con-
fusion this sight put me into, especially seeing
them come on my side of the island, and so
near me too; but when I considered their
coming must be always with the current of
the ebb, I began, afterwards, to be more sedate
in my mind, being satisfied that I might go
abroad with safety all the time of the tide of
flood, if they were not on share before; and
having made this observation, I want abroad
about my harvest work with the more com-

ure.

Al I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as
the tide made to the westward, I saw them all
take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it)
away. I should have observed, that for an
hour or more before they went ofi', they went
a. dancing; and I could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glass. I could
not perceive, by my nicest oburvation, but
that they were stark naked, and had not the
least covering upon them; but whether they
were men or women, I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone,
I took two guns upon my shoulders, and two
pistol: in my girdle, and my great sword by
my side, without a soabbard, and with all the

I was able to make, went away to the
hill where I had discovered the first appear-
ance ofall;and assoonaslgotthither,which
was not in less than two hours (for I could not
go space, being so loaden with arms as Iwas)
I perceived there had been three canoes more
If savages at that place; and looking out

farther, I saw they were all at sea together,
melting over for the main. This was a dread-
ful eight to me, especially as, going down to the
shore, I could see the marks of horror, which.
the dismal work they had been about had left
behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and de-
voured by those wretches with mcrrimcnt and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the
sight, that I now began to premeditate the
destnlction of the next that I saw there, let
them be whom or how many soever. It seemed
evident to me that the visits which they made
thus to this island were not very frequent, for
it was above fifteen months before any more
of them came on shore there again; that is to
say, I neither saw them, nor any botsteps or
signals of them, in all that time; for, as to the
rainy seasons, then they are sure not to coma
abroad, at least not so far: yet all this while
I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the con-
stant apprehensions of their coming upon me
by surprise: from whence I observe, that the
expectation of evil is more bitter than the suf-
fering, especially if there is no room to shake
of that expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time I was in the murdering
humour, and took up most of my hours, which
should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall u them, the very
next time I should see them; especially if they',
should be divided, as they were the last time,
into two parties: nor did I consider at all, that
if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I
was still the next day, or week, or month, to
lrill another, and so another, even ad in/milmn,
till I should be at length no less a mulderer
than they were in being mameaters, and per-
lapsth more so. Ispentmydays now in
perplcsity and anxiety of mind, expect-
tbat I should, one day or other, fall into
tbehands of these merciless creatures; and if
I did at any time venture abroad, it was not
without looking round me with the greatest
eareand caution imaginable. And now I found,
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame floclt or herd ofgoats; for
I durst not, upon any account, tire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they
usually came, lest I should alarm the savages;
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure
to have them come again, with perhaps two
or three hundred canoes with them, in a lbw
days, and then I knew what to expect. How-
ever, I wore out a year and three months more
before I over saw any more of the savages,
and then I found them again, as I shall soon
observe. It is true, they might have been
there once or twice, but either they made
nostay, or at leastI did not see them: but in
the month of May, as near as I could calculate,
_and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a
very strange encounter with them; of which
in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this
fifteen or sixteen months' interval, was very
gmt', I slept unquiet, dreamed always fright-
titl dreams, and often started out of my sleep
in the night: in the day, great troubles over-
whelmed my mind; and in the night, I dreamed
often ofltilling the savages, and of the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But, to
wave all link for a. while--It was in the mid-
dle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as
well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon,
for I marked all upon the still; I say, it
was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a
very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul
night it was after it. I knew not what was
the particular occasion of it. but as I was
reading in the Bible, and taken up with very
serious thoughts about my present condition,
Iwas surprised withthe noise ofagun,asl
thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure,
a surprise quite of a different nature Gum any
I had met with before; for the notions this put
into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable,
and,in a trice, clapped my ladder to the mid-
dle place ofthe rock,and pulled it aflerme;
and mounting it the second time, got to the
topd'the hill thevery mornentthatadaahof

partoftheseawhere lwasdrivendown the
current in my boat. I immediately considered
that this must be some ship in distrea, and
that they had some comade, or some other
ship in company, and fired these guns for sig-
nals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the
presence of mind, at that minute, to think,
that though I could not help them, it might be
they might help me: so I brought together all
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making
a good handsome pile, last it on fire upon the
hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely;
and though the wind blew very hard. yet it burnt
fairly out: so that I was certain, if there was
any such thing as a ship, they must needs see '
it; and nodouht they did; for as soon as over
my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and
taller that several others, all from the same
quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till day-
break; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up, I saw something at a t dis-
tance at sea, full cast of the island, whethera
soil or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not
with my glass; the distance was so great, and
the weather still something hazy also; at least,
it was so out at sea.

. I looked liequently at it all that day, and
soon perceived that it did notmove; so Iprc-
sently concluded that it was a ship at anchor;
and being eager, you may be sure, to be entice
tied, I tool: my gun in my hand, and ran to-
wards the south side of the island, to the rocks
where I had formerly been carried away with
the current; and getting up there, the weather
by this time being perfectly char, 1 cwld
plainly see, to my great ant-raw, the wreck ofa
ship, out away in the night those con-
cealed rocks which I found when I was out in
my boat; and which rocks, as they checked
the violence of the stream, and made a kind of
counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of
my recovering from the most desperate, hope-
less condition that ever I had been in, all my
life. Thus, what is one man's safety is antr
thcr man's destmetion ; for it seems these men,
whoever they were, being out of their know
ledge, and the rocks being wholly underwater,
had been driven upon them in the night, the
wind blowing hard at E. N. E. Had they
seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose
they did not, they must, as I thought, have
endeavoured to have saved themselves on she
by the helpoftheirbost; but their firingofl'

much as to guess what nation he'vms of: he
had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of.
eight and a tobacco-pipe ;--Ihe last was to Inc
often times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to
venture out in my boat to this wreck, not
doubting but I might find something on board
that might be useful to me: but that did not
altogether press me so much as the possibility
that there might be yet some living creature
on board, whose life I might not only save, but
might, be s'a\ ing that life, comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thout'ht clunu so to
my heart, that I could not be quiet lllglll or
day, but I must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck; and counnitting the rest to
God's providence, I thought the impreSs'ion
was so strong upon my mind that it could not
be resisted, that it must come from some invi-
sible direction. and that I should be wanting
to myself if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I has-
tened back to my castle, prepared every thing
for my voywe, took a quantity of bread, a
greatp pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by,
a bottle of rum, (for I had still a great deal of
that left.) and a buhet of raisins: and thus,
loading myself with every thing necessary, I
went down to my boat, got the water out of her,
put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and
then went home again for more. I\Iy second
cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to
set up over my head for a shade, another large
pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than befbre,
with a. bottle of goat's milk and a cheese: all
which, with great labour and sweat, I carried
to my boat; and praying to God to direct my
voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling,
the canoe along the shore, came at last to the
utmost point of the island on the northeast
side. And now I was to launch out into the
ocean, and either to venture or not to venture.
I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance,
and which were very terrible to me, from the
remembrance of the hazard I had been in be-
fore, and my heart began wfiil me; for I fore-
saw that if I was driven into either of those
currents, I should be carried a great vIay out
to sea. and perhaps out of my reach, or sight
oftbeialand again; mdtlntthcn,asmy boat
was but small, if any little gale of wind should
rise, I should be inevitably lost.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and
anxious, between fear and desire, about my
voyage; when, as I was musing, I could pch
wire that the tide was turned, and the flood
come on' , upon which my going was imprac-
ticable for so many hours. Upon this, pree
scnIly it occurred tome, that I should go up to
the highest piece of ground I could find, and
ubsen'e, if I could, how the sets of the tide, or
currents, lay when the flood came in, that l
migltt judge whether, ifI was driven one way
out, I might not expect to be driven another
way home, with the same rapidness of the cur-
rents. This thought was no sooner in my
head than I cast my eye upon a little hill,
which sufficiently overiookcd the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of
the currents, or sets ufthe tide, and which way
I was to guide myself in my return. Here I
found, that as the current of the ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the
current of the flood set in close by the shore of
the north side; and that I had nothing to do
hutto keep to the north side of the island in
my return, and I should do wellcnough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved,
the IIEXI morning, to set out with the first of
the tide; and reposing myself for the night
in my canoe, under the great It atchcoat I
mentioned, I launched out. I first made a
little ottt to sea, full north, till I began to feel
the benefit of the cur-rent, which set eastward,
and which carried me at a great rate; and yet
did not so hurry me as the current on the south
side had done before, so as to take from Inc
all govemmcntef the boat; but having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went at a great
rate directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight
to look at: the ship, which, by its building, was
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two
rocks; all the stern and quarter of her were
beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on
with great violence, her mainmast and fare-
mastwere brought by the board, that Is to say,
broken short elf, but her bowsp rit was sound,
and the head and bow appeared firm. When
I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her,
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and
as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea
to come to me; I took him into the boat, but
found him almost dead with hunger and thirst.
Igavc him acake ofmy Ines/Land he devoured
it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving
a fortnight In the snow: I then gave the pot:
creature some fresh water, with which, if I
would have let him, he would have burst hin-
self. Me: this, I wentoaboard i but the tint
light I met with was two men drowned in
the cook-room, or forecastloof the ship, with
their arms fast about one another. I concluded,
as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck,
it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and
so continually over her, that the men were
not able to bear it, and were strangled with
the constant uniting in of the water. as much
as if they had been under water. Besides the
dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had
life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some
casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which,
the WMt'l' being ebbed out, I could see; but
they were too big to meddle with. I saw se-
veral chests, which I believed belonged to some
of the seamen; and I got two of them into the
boot, without examining what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fired, and tho
litrcpart broken 05', I am persuaded I might
have made a good voyage; for, by what I found
in these two chests, I had room to suppose the
ship had a great dealof wealth on board: and,
if I may guess from the course she steered,
she must have been boundfrom Buenos Ayres,
or the Rio dc la Plata, in the south part of
America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havana.
m the Gulfof Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.
She had,no doubt, a great treasure in her, but
of no use, at that time, to any body; and what
became of her crew, I then ltnew not.

I found, besides these chests, a little caskfull
of liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got
into my boat with muebdilliculty. There were
several markets in the cabin, and a great pow-
derhom, with about four pounds of powder in
it; as for the muskets. I had no occasion for
them, so Ilell them, but took the powderhorn.
I took a fireehovcl and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as abo two little brass kettles, a.
copper pot to make dtoeolate,and a gridiron .
and with this cargo, and the dog,l came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and
the same evening, aboutan hour within night,
1 reached the island again, weary and fatigued
to tho lastdegree. I repooed that nightin the
boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbour
what! hadgot iamynew oave,and not carry
it home to my castle. Afier refreshing my~
self, Igotallmy cargoonahove,andbeganto

of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cop.
dial waters, fine and very good; the bottles
held about three pints each, and were tipped
with silver. I found two pots of very good we-
cades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the
lop, that the salt water hadnot hurt them ; and
two more of the some, which the water had
spoiled. I lbund some very good shirts. which
were very welcome to me; and about a dozen
and a half of white linen handkerchief: and
Coloured neckcloths; the former were also very
welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe
my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I
came to the till in the chest, I found there three
great bags of pieces-ol'oeight, which held about
eleven hundred pieces in all: and in one of
them, wrapped up in a paper, six doublonns of
gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold;
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.
In the other chest were some clothes, but of
little value ; but, by the circumstances, it must
have belonged to the gttnner's mate; though
there was no powder in it, except two pounds
of line glazed powder, in three small flasks,
ltept, I suppose, for charging their fouling:-
pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got
very little by this voyage that was of any use
to me; for, as tothc money, I had no manner
of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt
under my feet: and I would have given it all
for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted,
but had none on my feet for many years. I
had indeed got two pair of shoes now, which
I took at? the feet of the two drowned men
whom I saw in the wreck, andIfuund twopair
more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our
English shoes, either for ease or service, being
rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found
in this aeaman's chest about fifty pieces-of.
eight in rials, but no gold: I suppose this be-
longed to a poorer man than the other, which
seemed to belong to some oflicer. Well, horr~
ever, I logged this money home to my care,
and laid it up, as I had done that belhre which
I brought from our own ship: but it wasa grcnt
pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship
had not come to my share; fit: I am satisfied
I might have loaded my canoe several times
over with money i and, thought I, if I ever es-
cape to England, it might lie here safe emugh
till I may come again andfeteh it.

Having now brought all my things on there,
and secured them. I went back to my boat,
and rowed or paddled her along the shore to
her old harbour, where I laid her up, and
made the best of my way to my old habitation,84

where I found every thing safe and quiet. I
began now to repose myself, lit-c after my old
fashion, and lake Care of tny family nfl'airs;
and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only
lhatI was moro vigilant than luscd to be,
looked out oflencr, and did not go abroad so
much; and if at any time I did stir with any
freedom, it was always to the east part oftho
island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never came, and where I could go
without so many precautions, and such a load
of arms and ammunition as I always carried
with me if I went the other way. I lived in
this condition near two years more; but my
unlucky head, that was always to let me know
it was born to make my body miserable, was
all these two years filled with projects and de-
signs, how, if it were possible, I might get
away from this island: for sometimes I was
for making another voyage to the wreck,
though my rcuon told me that there was
nothing let! there worth the hazard of my
voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way,
sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I
had had the boat that I went from Sallce in,
I should have ventured to sun, bound any
where, I knew not whither. I have been, in
all my circumstances, a memento to those who
are touched with the general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of
their miseries flow; I mean that of not being
satisfied with the station wherein God and
nature hath placed them: for, not to look back
upon my primitive condition, and the excellent
advice of my father, the opposition to which
was, as I maycall it, my original sin, my sub-
sequent mistakes of the same kind had been
the means of my coming into this miserable
condition; for had that Providence, which so
happily seated me at the Bruits as a planter,
blessed me with confined desires, and I could
have been contented to have gone on gradually,
I might have been, by this time, I mean in the
time of my being in this island, one of the moat
considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I
am persuaded, that by the improvements I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the
increase I should probably have made if I had
remained, I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores: and what business had I
to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plan-
tation, improving and increasing, to turn so-
percargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased
curatoclt at home, that we could have bought

ness it was to fetch them: and though ithad

that price was by no means worth saving at so
great a hazard? But as this is usually the
fate of young heads, so reflection upon the
folly of it is as commonly the exercise ofmoro
years, or of the dcarbought experience of
time: so it was with me now; and yet so
deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station,
but was continually poring upon the means
and possibility of my escape from this place:
and'that I may, with the greater pleasure to
the reader, bring on the remaining part of my
story, it may not be improper to give some
account of my first conceptiors on the subject
of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how,
and upon what lbundalion, I acted.

I am now to be supposed retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my
frigate laid up and secured under water, as
usual, and my condition restored to what it
was bclbre; I had more wealth, indeed, than
I had before, but was not at all the richer ; for
I had no more use for it than the Indians of
Peru had before the Spaniards come there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season
in March, the fourhand-twcntieth year of my
first setting foot in this island of solitude, I was
lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no
uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of
.rnind, more than ordinary, but could by no
means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep;
no, not awink all night long, otherwise than as
followsz--It is impossible to set down the in-
numerable crowd of droughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain,
the memory, in this night's time: I ran over
the whole history of my lite in miniature, or
by abridgmcnt, as I may call it, to my com-
ing to this island, and also of that part of my
life since I came to this island. In my reflec-
tions upon the state of my case since I came
on shureon this island, I was comparing the
happy posture of my afl'aira in the first years
of my habitation here, compared to the life of
anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in,
everaincel hadseen the print ofafootinthe
land; not that I did not believe the savages
had frequented the island even all the while,
and might have been several hundreds of them
at times on shore there; but I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehen-
sions about it; my satisfaction was perfect,
though my danger was the same, and I was as
happy in not knowing my danger as If} had
never really been exposed to it. This fitn-
nishcd my thoughts with many very profita-
ble reflections, and partiwlarlv this one: Harv
infinitely good that Providence is, which has
provided, in its government of mankind, such
narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of
so many thousand dangers, the sight of which,
if discovered to him, would distract his mind
and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and
calm, by having the events of things hid from
his e es, and knowin troth' of the era
which surround him. 8 mg dang

AIIef these thoughts had for some time en-
tertained me, I come to reflect seriously upon
the real danger I had been in for so many years
in this very island, and how I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all
possible tranquillity, even when no-
thing but the brow ofa hill, 1 great tree, or the
casual ap h of night, had been between
me and the worst kindot'destntction, viz. that or
falling into the hands of cannibols and savages,
who would have seized on me with the same
view as I would on a goat or a turtle,and have

ht it no more a crime to kill and devour
me, than I did a pigeon or curlew. I would
unjustly slander myself, if I should say I was
not sincerely thankful to my great Preoerver,
to whose singular protection I acknowledged,
with great humility, all these unknown deli-
verances were due, and without which I must
inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head
was for some time taken up in considering the
nature of these wretched creatures, I moan the
savages, and how it came to pass in the world,
that the wise Governor of all things should give
up any of his creatures to such inhumanity,
nay, to something so much below even brutal-
ity itself, are devour its own lrind: but as
this ended in some (at that time) fruitless

ulations, it occured to me to inquire what
part ofthe world these wretchee lived in '! how
far oi? the eoost was from whence they came 1?
what they ventured over so far from home tor?
what kind ofboats theyhadl and why I might
not order myself and my business so, that I
might bar as able to go over thither as they
were to come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consi-
tlcr what I should do with myself when I went
thither; what would become of me, if I fell
into the hands of the savages; or how I should
escapefrom them, if they attacked me; no, no.-
so much as how it was possible for me to reach
the coast, and notbe attacked by some or other
of them, without any posibility of delivering
myself; and if I should notfall into their hands,
what I should do for isiou, or whither I
shouldbend mycourse: none ofmese droughts,

85

I say, so much as came inmyway; butmy
mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my
pascingoverinmyboattothemoinland. I
looked upon my pveacnt condition as the most
miserable that could possibly be; that [was
not able to throw myself into any thing, but
death, that could be called worse: 8nd if I
reached the shore of the min, I might perhaps
meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I
did on the African shore, till I came to some
inhabited country, and where I might find
some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might
fall in with some Christian ship that might
take me in: and ifthe woratctune to theworst,
I could but die, which would put an end to all
these miseries at once. Pray note, all this
was the fruit ol'a disturbed mind, an impatient
temper, made desperate, as it were, by the
long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I hadrnet in the wreck I had
been on board of, and where Ihad been so
near obtaining what i to earnestly longed tor,
viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some
knowledge from them of the place where I was,
and of the probable means of my deliverance.
I was agitated wholly by these thoughts; all
my calm of mind, in my resignation to Provi-
dence, and waiting the imue of the disposi-
tions of Heaven, seemed to be stupendcd; and
I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but to the project of a voyage to
the min; which came upon me with such
force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that
it was not. to be misled.

When this had agitated my thoughts for
two hours or more, with such violence that it
set my very blood into a ferment, and my
pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely
with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about
it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and ex-
hausted with the very lhought of it, threw me
into a sound sleep. One would have thought
I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor
ofany thing relating to it: but I dreamed that
as I was going out in the morning, unusual,
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two
canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and
that they brought with them mother savage,
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat
him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they
were going to kill jumped away, and ran for
his life; and I thought, in 'my sleep, that he
came running into my little thick grove before
my fortification, to hide himself; and that I.
seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
other: sought him that way, showed myselfto
him,and smiling upon hinr,enoouraged him
that he heeled down to me, seeming to pray
me to assist him; upon which [showed him
my ladder, made him go up, and carried him
into my cave, and he bewne my servant: and
tbatasoeon aslhadgot this man,Isaidto
myself, Now I may oertaintly venture to the
main land; for this follow will serve me as a
pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither
to go for provisions, and whither not to go liar
fear of being devoured; what places to ven-
ture into, and what to shun. I waked with this
thought; and was under such inexpressible
impressions ofjey at the prospect of my escape
in my dream, that the disappointments which
I felt upon coming to myself, and finding that
it was no more than a. dream. were equally
extravagant the other way, and threw me into
a very great dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however,I made this conclusion;
that my only way to go about to attempt an
escape was, if possible, to get a savage into
my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had con-
demned to be eaten, and should bring hither to
kill. But these thoughts still were attended
with this difficulty, that it was impossible to
efi'ect this without attacking a whole caravan
of them, and killing them all; and this was
not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry, but,on tho other hand, I had greatly
sampled the lawfulness of it to myself; and
my heart trembled at the droughts of shedding
so much blood, though itwas for my deliver-
ance. I need not repeat the arguments which
occurred to me against this, they being the
same mentioned before: but though I had
other reasons to ofi'er now, viz. that those men
were enemies to my life, and would devour me
if they could; that it was self-preservation, in
the highest degree, to deliver myself from this
death of a life, and was acting in my own
defence as much as if they were actually as-
saulting me, and the like; I say, though these
things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shed-
ding human blood for my deliverance were

means reconcile myself to for a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disput-
with myself, and after great perpleaities about
it.(fora|lthesea ,onewayandano-
ther, struggled in my head a long time,) the
eager prevailing daire of deliverance at
length mastered all the rest; and I resolved,
if possible, to get one of these savages into
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
was to eontrivo how to do it, and this indeed
wasverydiflicultto resolve on: butaII could
pitch upon no probable mean for it, so I rw
solved to put myself upon the watch, to see
them when they came on shore, and leave
thereat totheevent; taking such measures
as the opportunity should prune, let what
would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I
set myself upon the scout as often as possible,
and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired
ofit; for itwasaboveayearanda halfthat
Iwaited; andfor great partof that time went
out to the west end,and to the southwest
corner, of the isla'nd, almost every day, to look
for canoes, but non;Id appeared. 'I'h't'sl was

case (as it had donesome time before) wear
ofl'the edge ofmy desireto the thing; but
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more
eager I was for it: in a word, I wasnotat
first so areful to shun the sight of these aa-
vages, and avoid being seen by them, as I
was now eager to be upon them. Besides, I
fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I
should direct them, and to prevent their being
able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a
gmt while that I pleased myself with this
afi'air; butnothingstillpreeented; all myfan-
cies and schemes came to nothing, Rx no
savages came nearme for a great while.

hsllooedagain tohim, and maderignstooome
forward, which be easily understood, and came
a little way; tbenstopped again,and then s
little farther, and stopped again; and I could
then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he

could think'of; andhe earns nearerand nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps,
in token of admowledgment for saving his
life. I smilcdsthint, and looked pleasantly,
and beekonedto him to come still nearer: at

he came close to me; and than he
heeled down again, kissed the ground, and
laid his head upon the grotmd, and taking me
bythefoot,setmy foot upon his head; this,
it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave tirr ever. I took him up, and made much
ot'him, and encouraged him all Icould. But
there was moreworktodoyet; for Iperoeived
the savage whom I knocked down was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himself: eoI pointed to him, and
showed him the savage, that he was not dead ;
upon this he spoke some words to me, and
though I could not understand them, yet I
thought they were pleasant to hear; for they
were the first sound of a man's voice that I
had heard, my own , for above twen-
ty-five years. But there was no time forsuch
reflection new: the savage who was knocked
down recovered himselfao far as tosit up upon
the grotmd, and I perceived that my savage
began to be afraid; but when Issw that, I
presented my other piece at the man, as if I
would shoot him: upon this my savage, forso
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hungnaked in abelt by
my side, which I did. He no sooner had it,
but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow,
cut of his head so cleverly, no executioner in
Germany could have done it sooner or better:
which I thought very strange for one who, I
had reason to believe, neversaw asword in his
life betbre, except their own wooden swords:
however, it scents, as I learned silerwards,
they make their wooden swords so sharp, so
heavy, and the wood ino hard, that they will
cut od' heads even with them, my, and arm,
and that at one blow too. When he had done

mnph,andbrooght me thesword sgain, Ind
with abrmrlanoeofgestures, which Ididnot
understand, laiditdm,with theheadd'tbe
savage that he had killed, just before lite.
Bu that which astonished him most, was to
know howIkilled theotherIndianso farnfi':
sopeinting to him,be undo signs tone to
lethimgotohim: soIbade himgo,aswell
asIoould. Wbenhe came tohim, hestood
like one amazed. looking at him, turning him
first on one side, then on theother, looked
at the wound the bullet had made, which, it
seems,wasjust inhis breast, whereit had
made I. hole,andno great quantity ofblood
had thllowed; but he had bled inwardly, the
he was quite dead. He took up his bow and
arrows,andcamebaek: solturnedto go
away, and heckonedhirn to follow me, making
signs to him that more might come after them.
Upon this, he mode sign to me that he
should bury them with sand, that they might
not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and
solmadesi tohimagaintodoso.
He fell to work; and, in an instant, hehad
scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged
him intuit, andcovered him; awddid soby
the other also: lbelieve he had buried them
both in I quarter of an hour. Then calling
him away,I carried him, not to my castle, but
quite away to my care, on the farther part of
the island: so I didnot let my dreameomo
to pass in that part, viz. that he came into my
grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and
a bunch of raisins to eat,anda draught of
water, which I found he was indeed in great
distress for, by his running; and having re-
fieshed him, I made signs for him to go and
lie down to sleep, showing him a place where
I had hid some rice straw, and a blanket up-
on it, which I used tosleep upon myselt'some-
times; so the poor creature lay down, and
went to sleep.

He was s. comely, handsome fellow, pert-
feCtly well made, with straight strong limbs,
not too large, tall,and well shaped; and, as I
reekon,ahmt twenty-six years oi'age. He had
a. very good countenance, not s fierce and surly
aspect, but seemed to have something very
manly in his face; and yet he had all the sweet-
nessantlsoilneesofan European in Macon-
tenance too, especially when he smiled. His
hair was long and black, not urn-led like wool;
his forehead very high and large; and a great
vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes.

very tawny; and yet notsn ugly, yellow, nau-

seat, tolerably well, and was mighty well
blessed to see himselfalmost an svell clothed
as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly
in these clothes at first: wearing the drawers
was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of
the waistcostgalled his shoulden, and the in-
side of his arms; but alter a little easing them
where he complained they httrt him, and using
himself to them, hetook to but atlength
very well. .

Thene day after Icame home tomy
hutch with him, I began to consider where I
should lodge him; and that I might do well
for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the inside of
thelnst and intbe outside ofthe first. As
there was a door or entrance there into my
cave, I made aformal frameddoorcase,anda
doortoit ofboards,andsetitupinthepas-
stage, a little within the entrance; andcausing
thedoor toopen intheinside, I harred itup
inthenight, taking inmy ladderstoo; sothat
Friday could no waycome atrne in the inside
of my innermost well, without making so
much noise in getting over that it must needs
wakenme; for mylirstwall hadnowacom-
plate roof over it of long poles, covering all
my tent, and leaning up to the side ofthe hill;
which wasagain laid acrme with smaller sticks,
instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thickness with the rice straw, which was
strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place
whichwaslefl toga inoroutbythelsdder, I
had placeda kind of trapdoor, whidr, if it had
been attempted on the outside, would not have
opened at all, but would have fallen down, and
makeagrcatnoisezas towespons,I took
them all into my side every night. But I
needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere ser-
vant, than Friday was to me; without
sions, wllenneas, or designs, perfectly obliged
and engaged; his very afl'ections were tied to
me, like thoseofa child toa father; andl
dare say, he would have sacrificed his life for
the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso-
ever: the manyteetimonies he gave me ol'this
put. it out of doubt, and soon convinced me
that Ineeded tousenoprecautions,as tomy
safety on his account.

This frequently gave the occasion to observe,
and that with wonder, that however it had
pleased God, in his providence, and in the
government of the works of his hands, to take
from so greatapart oftheworldofhis crea-
tures the best uses to which their faculties and
lie powers of their souls are adapted,yet that

the samereason, the same Mona, the same
sentiments of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentment- of wronga.the
same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity
and all theeapacitiesofdoingioodnnd re-
ceiving good, that he has given to us; and
that when he pleases to ofl'er them owesions
ofexertingthese,theyareasready,nay,more
ready, to apply themto the right ttsesfor which
they were bestowed, than we are. Th'u made
me very rne sometimes, in reflecting,
as the several occasions presented, bow mean
ause wemakeofall these,even though we
have these powers enlightened by the great
lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge ofhis wordadded toourun-
demanding; and why it has pleased God to
hide the like saving knowledge front so many
million of souls, who, if I might judge by
this poor savage, would make a rnuch better
nseof it than we did. From hence, I some-
times wasled too far,to invade the sovereignty
of Providence, and as it were arr-sign the jua

ties ofao arbitrary a dispositionof things, that
should hide that light from some, and reveal
it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both; but I shut it up, and checked my
thoughts with this <<inclusion: first, That we
did not knowby what light and law these
ahouldbecondemned; but that as God was
necemrily, and, hythe nature of his being,
infinitely holyand just, so itcould not be, but
ifthese creatures were all sentenced to ab-
sence from himself, it was on account of sin-
ning againstthat l' t, which, as the Scripture
says, was a lawlgththemselves, and by such
rules as their consciences would acknowledge
to be just, though the foundation was not dis-
covered to us; and, secondly, That still, as we
all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no
veerel could say to hint, Why hastthou formed
mo thus?

But to return to my new companion :---I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my
business to teach him every thing that was
proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful;
but especially tornake him speak, and traders
stand tnewhen lspoke: and he was the aptest
scholar that ever was; and particularl was
so merry, so constantly diligent, and so
when he could but understand me, or make me
understand him, that it was very pleasant to
me to talk to him. Now my lifebegantobe

hutwhen he cametotsste the tied:y bored:
so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him: and at
lost he told me, as well ashe could, he would
neverent rnsn'sflesh anymore, whichIwu
very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to worlr tobeating
some corn out, and sitting it in themanner I
usedtodo,asI observed before; and be soon
understood how todo it uwell as I, especially
after he had seen vrbat the meaning of it was,
andthatit was to maltehresdofit; foralier
thatIlethimsee me make mybread,andbake
it too; and in a little time Friday was able to
donll thoworlr for me, aswellssI could do
it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two
mouths to feed instesd of one, I must provide
more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger
quantityofcomthanlusedtodo; solmarlred
outalargerpieceofland, andbegan thefence
intbe same manner as before, in which Friday
worked not only very willingly and very hard,
but did it very cheerfully : and I told him what
itwastbr; thatitwasfitrcorntomsko more
hread,becausehewesnowwithme,utdthat
I might have enough liar him and myself too.
He appeared very sensible of that part, and let
melrnowthathethoughtIhadmochmore
lshouruponmeonhisscoount, than lhndthr
myself; and that he would work the harder
for me, if I would tell him what to do.

>This was the pleasantest year of all the life
I led inthis plsce; Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understand the names of slmost every
thing! had occasion to call for, andofevery
place [had tossnd him to, and talkedsgrcst
dealto me; so that, inshort,lbegannowto
have some use list my tongue again, which,
indeed, I had very little octasion for before,
that is to say, about speech. Besides the
pleasure of talking to him, I had a singulu
satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple
unfeignod honesty to me more and
more every day, and I began really to love the
creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved
memorethsn itwaspossihle forhimeverto
love any thing before.

Ihsdamind once totryifhe hadanyhan-
lrering inclination to his own country sgsin;
and having taught him English so well that he
could answer me almostany question, I asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? at which he smiled,
and said, Yes, yes, we alwsys fight the better:

By this I understood that my man Friud'g

whcnltookthe to carry him tothat

there once when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child. he could not tell twenty
in English, but be numbered them, by laying
so many stones in a row, and pointing to me
to tell them over.

firtheinformation of thispoor savage; andI had
more efi'ection in my inquiry after things upon
this occasion than ever I felt before: so that,
whether this poor wild wretch was the better
for me or no, I had great reason to be thank-
ful thatever he came tome; my griefset lighter
upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to
me beyond measure: and when I reflected,
that in this soiitarylife which I had been cott-
fined to, I had not only been moved to look up
to Heaven myself, and to seek to the hand that
had brought me here, but was now to be made
an instrument, under Providence, to save the
life, and, for ought. I knew, the soul, of a poor
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of
religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that
he might know Christ Jesus, inth is life
eternal; I say, when I reflected upon allthese
things, asecret joy ran through every part of
my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, whichI had soofion
thought the most dreadful of all afliictions that

could posibly have befallen me.

I continued in this thankful ti-ame all the
reminder of my time; and the conversation
which employed the hours between Friday and
me was such, as made the three years which
we lived there together perfectly and completely
happy, ifany such thing as complete happi-
ness can he fhrmed in a sublunury state. This
savage was now a goodChristian, a much bet-
ter than'I; though I have reason to hope, and
bleeeGod for it, that we were equally penitent,
and comforted, restored penitents. We had
here the word of God to road, and no farther
of than his Spirit to instruct, than if we
had been in England. I always applied my-
self, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know,
as well as I wuld, the meaning of what I read;
and be again, by his serious inquiries and

95

questionings, made rue, as I said before, u
much better scholar in the Scripture-knowledge
than I should ever have been by my own mere
private reading. Another thing I cannot re-
fi'ain from observing here also, from experience
in this retired part of my life, viz.'how infinite
and incxprcssible a blessing it is that the know-
ledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation
by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the
word ofGod, so easy to be received and un-
derstood, that, as the bare reading the Scrip-
ture made me capable of understanding enough
of my duty to carry me directly on to the great
work of sincere repentance for my sins, and
laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation,
toa stated reformation in practice, and obe-
dience to all God's commands, and this with-
out any teacher or instructor, I mean human;
so, the same plain instruction sufficiently served
to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have
known few equal to him in my life.

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and
contention, which have happened in the world
about religion, whether niceties in doctrines,
or schemes of church government, they were
all perfectly useless to us, and, for ought I can
yet see, they have been so to the rest of the
world. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz.
the word ofGod; and we had, blessed be God,
comfortable views of the Spirit of God teach-
ing and instructing us by his word, leading us
into all truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of his word. And
I cannot see the least use that the greatest
knowledgeof the disputed points of religion,
which have made such confusions in the world,
would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained iL--But I must go on with the historical
part of thinge,andtake every part in its order.

fore, without any more delay, I went to work
with Fridny, to find out n greet tree proper to
fell, and make n lnrge periagua, er canoe, to
undertnke the voyage. There were tree.
enough in the ialnnd to have built n little fleet,
not of pcriaguas, or canoes, but even of
lnrge vmek: but the main thing I locker:
was, to get one so near the water that we
might lnuneh it when it was made, to avoid
the mistake I committed or tint. At last,
Friday pitched upon a. tree; for I found he

' know much better then I what kind of wood
was fittest for it: nor can I tell, to this tiny,
whnt wood to call the tree we cut down, except
.that it was very like the tree we call rustic, or
between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it
was much of the same colour and smell.
Friday wns for burning the hollow er mvity
of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I
showed him how to cut it with tools; which,
nfler I had nhotved him how to use, he did
very hnndily: and in nhout a. month's herd
labour we finished it, end nude it very hand-
some; ially when, with our axes, which
I showed him how to hurdle, we cut and hewcd
'the outside into the true shape ot'n bent. Afier
thin, however, it cost us nenr a fortniglrt'e
time to get her dong, no it were inch by indt,
upon greet rollen into the wnter; but when she
was in, she would have curried twenty men
with great use.

When the WI: in the water, end though the
we: no big, it med me to see with what
dexterity, And how ewifl my mnn Friday would

. manage her, turn her, and paddle her along.
So I asked him if he would, and if we might,
venture 'over in her. Yes, be said; we ven-
tdre ever in her very well, though greet blew
wind. However, I bed a farther design, thnt

what we all in England a IbeuldeMI-mutten

thebeetin which Imademyeecnpefrotn Bar-

I wu near two months performing this last
work, viz. rigging end fitting my meat and
rails; for I finished them very complete,
melting n mall ntay, nnd n sail, or foresail, to
it, to will, if we should turn to windward;
and, which was more then all. I fixed a rudder
to the stern of her to steer with. I was but I
bungling shipwright, yet, .3 I knew the use.
l'ulneea, end even necessity of ruch n thing, I
applied myself with so mud) [mine to do it,
the! at lutl brought it to pass; though, con-
sidering the mnny dull contrivnnees I had for
it that failed, I think it cost me alumna much
labour In making the bout.

Afler all this wu done, I had my men Fri-
day to teach no to what belonged to the nevi-
gntion of my bent; for, though he knew very
well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing
what belonged to a nail and n rudder; and was
the most amazed when he saw me work the
bent to and again in the see by the rudder, and
how the sail gibbed, end filled this way, or that
way, as the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he new this, he stood like one astonished
nnd around. However, with a little use, I
made all these things Eunilinr to him, and he
became an expert seilor, except thnt u to the
campus, I could make him undemnd very
littleoftbnt. Ontheotherbnnd,nstherewu
very little cloudy weather, nnd aeldotn or never

occasion tor n compass, seeing the ears were

to get into the wood, so that I might come
within shot of them befitre I should be dis-
covered, which I had seen, by my glass, it was
easy to do.

While I was making this march, my time:
thughts returning, I began to abate my resolu-
tion: I do not mean that I entertained any
fear of their number; for, as they were naked,
unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior
to them; nay, though I had been alone. But
it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what
occasion, much lea what necessity l was in,
to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack peo-
ple who had neither done or intended me any
wrong! Who, as to me, were innocent, and
whose barbarous customs were their own dis-
aster; being, in them, a token indeed of God's
having lefl them, with the other nations of that
part of the world, to such stupidity, and to such
inhuman courses; butdid notcallme to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much
lesson executioner of his justice; that, when-
ever he thought fit, he would take the cause
into his own hands, and, by national vengeance,
punish them, as a people, for national crimes;
but that, in the mean time, it was none ofmy
busineu; that, it was true, Friday might jus-
tify it, because he was a declared enemy, and
in a state of wsrwith those very particular peo-
ple, and it was lawful for him to attack them;
but! couldnotsay the same with respect to
myself. These things were so warmly pressed
upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that
I resolved I would only go and place myself
Dar them, that I might observe their barba-
hus feugandthatlwould act then as God
should direct; but that, unless something ofl'ered
thatwsamoreacalltomothanyetlknewot',
I would not meddle with them.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE-

With this resolution I entered the wood;
and, with all ibls waarineas andsilence,
Friday following close at my heels, I marched
till I came to tho skirt of the wood, on the side
which was next to them, only that one corner
of the wood lay between me and them. Here
I called softly to Friday, and showing him a
great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me
word if he could see there plainly what they
were doing. He did so; and came imme-
diately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there; that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their pn-
sonera, and that another lay botutd upon the
sand, alittle from them, which, he said, they
would kill next, and which fired all the very
soul within me. He told me it was not one
of their nation, but one of the bearded men he
had told me of, that came to their country in
the host. I was filled with horror at the very
naming the white bearded man; and, going to
the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white
man. who lay upon the beach of the sea, with
his hands and h's feet tied with flags, or things
like "ashes, and that he was on European, and
had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket
beyond it, about filly yards nearer to them than _
the place where I was, which, by going a little
way about, I saw I might come at undis-
covered, and that then I should be within half
a shot of them; so I withheld my passion,
though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree, and going book about twentypaoes,
I got behind some bushes, which held all the
waytill I came to the other tree; and then
came to a little rising ground, which gave me
afull view of them, at the distance of about

eighty yards.

he a" :is , arm mm the other musket I took
my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the
like: then asking him if he was ready,"he
said, "Yes." " Then fire at them," said I;
and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I,
that on the side that he shot, he killed two of
them, and wounded three more; and on my
side, I killed one and wounded two. They
were, you may he sure, in a dreadful conster-
nation ; and all ofthem who were not hurtjump-
ed upon their feet, but. did not immediately
know which way to run, or which way to look,
to: they know not from whence their destruction
came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me,
that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I
did : so, soon as the firstshot was made, I threw
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece,
and Friday did the like the saw me cock and
present: he did the same again. " Are you
ready, Friday?" said I .---" Yes," says he.
" Let fly. then," says I, "in the name of
God !" and with that, I fired again among the
amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as
our pioees,wero now loaden with what I called
swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found
only two drop, but so many were wounded,
that they ran about yellinpnd screaming like
mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them
miserably wounded, whereof three more fell
quickly alter, though not quite dead.

" Now, Friday," says I, laying down the
discharged pieces, and taking up the musket
which was yet loaden, " follow me ;" which he

with a great deal of courage; upon which I

rushed out of the wood, and showed myself,
and Friday close at my foot. As soon asI
perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I
could, and bade Fridaydo so too; and running
as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not
very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I
made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said lying upon the beach, or shore,
between the place where they sat and the sea.
The two butchers, who were just going to
work with him, had left him at the surprise of
our first fire,and fled in a terrible fright to the
sen-side, and had jumped into a. canoe, and
three more of the rest made the same way. I
turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards,
and fire at them: he understood me immedi-
ately, and running about forty yards, to be
nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he

' had killed them all, for Isaw them all fall of a

heap in. the boat, though I saw two of them

.up again quickly: however, he killed two of

them, and wounded the third so, that it'll]
down in the bottom of the boat as if he had
been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled
out my knife and cut the flags that bound the
poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I
lifted him up, and asked him. in the Portu-
guese tongue, what he was. He answered'in
Latin, " Christianus 3" but was so weak and
faint that he c ld scarce stand or speak. I took
my bottle out . my pocket, and gave it hi-m,
making signs that he should drink, which he did,-
and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate.
Then I asked him what oountrvman he was-
and he said, Fapsgniole; and being a little
recovered, let me know, by all the signs he
could possibly make, how much he was in my
debt for his deliverance. Seignior, said I,
with as much Spanish as I could make up, we
will talk afterwards, but we must tight now: it"
you have any strength left, take tltis pistol and
sword, and lay about you. He took them very
thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in
his hands, but, as if they had put new vigour
into him, he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and had cut two ponof them' to pieces in an
instant; for the uuth' Is, as Ilte whole was a
surprise to them, so the poor creatures were
so much fiightened with the noise of our pieces,
that they fell down formero amazement and
fear, and had no more power to attempt their
own escape, than their flesh had to resist our
shot: and that was the ease of those live that
Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of then:
fell with the hurt they received, so the other
two fed with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still without
firing, being willing to keep my charge ready,
because I had given the Spaniard my pistol
and sword: so I called to Friday, and bade
him run up to the tree from whence we first
fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that
had been discharged, which he did with great
swiliness; and thengI giving him my musket,
I sat down myself to load all the rest again,
and bade them come to me when they wanted.
While I was loading these pieces, there hap-
pened a fierce engagement between the Spa-
niard and one oftho saIagt-s, II ho made at him
with one of their great IIooden swords, tho
same~like weapon that was to how killed him
before, if I had not presented it. The Spa.
niard, who was ashold and brave as could be
imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian
1 good while, and had cut him two great
wounds on his head; but the savage being a.
stout, lusty fellow, closing In with him, had
thrown him down, being faint, and was wring-
ingany sword out of his hand; when the Sp a-
ninrd, though undennost, wiselyq uitting the
sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the
savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who Was running to help
him, could come near him.

Friday being now lefi to his liberty, pursued
hell yingwretehee,wilh no weapon in his hand
on! his hatchet; and with that he delpatched
lhuothree, who, as I said he were wounded
at first, and fallen, and all rest he could
come upwith: and the Spaniard coming to
ma fora gm, I gave him one of tho fowling-
pieces, with which be pursued two of the sa-

vages, and wounded them both; but, ashe was
not able to run, they both got from him into the
wood, whore Friday pursued them, and killed
one of them, but the other was too nimble ibr
him; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with
all his might, all to those two who were left in
the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, that we knew not whether he died
or no, were all that escaped our hands of one-
and-twenty; the account of the whole is as
follows: thrce killed at our first shot from the
tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by
Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday of
those at first wounded; one killed by Friday
in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard;
four killed, being found dropped here and there,
of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his
chase ofthem; four emped in the boat, where-
of one wounded, if not dead.--Twenty-ono
in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard
to get out of gunshot, and though Friday made
two or three shots at them, I did not find that
he hit any of them. Friday would fain have
had me take one of their canoes, and pursue
them, and indeed, I wasvery anxious about
their escape, lest carrying the new home to
their people, they should me back perhaps
with two or three hundred of the canoes, and
devour us by mere multitude; so I cemented
topursue them by sea, and running to one of
their canoes,[ jumped in, and bade Friday
follow me; but when I was in the came, I
was surprised to find another poor creature lie,
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard
was, for the slaughter, and almoa dead with
fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he
had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat, he was tied whanl neck and heels,
and had been tied solong, that he had really
but little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags orrusltes,
which they had bound him with, and would
have helped him up; but he could not stand or
speak, but groaaed most piteously, believing,
it seerns, still, that he If" only unbound in
order to be killed. 'When Friday came to him,
I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his
deliverance; and, pulling out my bottle, made
him give the poor wretch a dram; which,with
the news of his being delivered, revived him,
and he satup in theboat. But when Friday
osmotohearphim speak, and look In hisface,

than I could walk, though the wind blew
pretty hard too: so he brought them both safe
into our creek. and leaving them in the boat,
ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he
passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him
whither he went. He told me, Go fetch more
boot: so away he went like the wind, for sure
never man or horse ran like him; and he had
the othcrcanoo in the creek almost assoon as
I got to it by land; so he waited me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the
boat, which he did; but they were neither of
them able to walk, so that poor Friday ltnew
not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my
thought, and calling to Friday to bid them sit
down on the bank while he came to me, I
coon made a kind of handbarrow to lay them
on, and Fridayand I carried them both up
together upon it, between us. But when we
got them to the outside of ourwall,or fortifi-
cation, we were at a worse loss than before,
for it was impossible to get them over,and I
was resolved not to break it down: so I set to
work again; and FridayandI, inabout two
houm' time, made a very tent,
covered with old nails, and above that with
bougha of trees, being in the space without
our outward fence, and between that and the
grove of young wood which I had planted;
and here we made them two beds of such
things asI had, viz. ofgood rice straw, with
blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to
cover them, on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought
myself very rich in subjects; and it was a
merry reflection, which! frequently made, how
like a king I looked. First of all, the whole
country was my own mere property, so that I
hadan undoubted right of dominion. Secondly,
my people were perfectly subjected; I waa
absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all owed
their lives to me, and were ready to lay down
their lives, if there had been occasion for it,
for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but
three subjects, and they were of three difi'erent
religions: my man Friday was a Protestant,
his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and
the Spanird was a Pepin; however, I allowed
liberty ofconacienee throughout my dominoins:

cookeditwithout doora,forImade nofire
within my inner wall, so I carried it all into
the new tent, and having set a table there for
them, I satdown, and eat my dinner also with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them,
and encwraged them. Friday wu my inter-
preter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to
the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spokethe
language of the savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I on-
dered Friday to take one of the canoes, and
go and fetch our muskets and other firearms,
which, for want of time, we had left upon the
place of battle: and, the next day, I ordered
himto go andburythedead bodies ofthe aa-
vages, which lay open to the sun, and would
presently be ofi'ensive. I also ordered him to
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous
feast, which I knew were pretty much, and
which I could not think of doing myself; nay,
Icould not bear to see them, if I went that
way; all which he punctually performed, and
efl'aced the very appearance of the savagea
being there; so that when I went again, I
could scarce know where it was, otherwise
than by the corner of the wood pointing to the
place.

I then began to enter into a little conversa-
tion with my two new subjects: and, first, I set
Friday to inquireofhis father what he thwght
of the escape oflho savages in that canoe, and
whether we might expect a return of them,
with a power too great for us to resist. His
first opinion was, that the savages in the
boat never could live out the atom which blew
that night they went oti', but must, of necessity
be drowned, or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured
asthey weretobedrowned, it'they wereeast
away: but, as to what they would do, if they
came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but
it was his opinion, that they were so dread-
fully frightened with tbe manner of their being
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he be-
lieved they would tell the people they were all
killed by thunder and lightning. not by the
handefman; andthatthetwowhich appeared,
viz. Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits,
or furiea, come down to destroy them, and not
men with wea . This, he said, he knew

a. serious discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I undermnd that there were sixteen
more of his and Portuguese, who,
having heenoast ewsy, and made their escape
to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with
the savages, but were very sore put to it for
necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him

but atthe mereyand discretion of the savages;
out of all hopes of over returning to their own
country; and that he was sure, if I would un-
dertake their relief, they would live and die
by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved toventurs
to relieve them, if possible, and to send the old
savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat.
But when we had got all things in readiness
to go, the Spaniard himself started an objec-
tion, which had so much prudenesin it, onone
hand, and so much sincerity, on the other hand,
that I could not but be very well satisfied in it;
and, by his advice, put of the deliverance of
his comrades for at least half a year. The
easewasthus: He had beenwithttsnowaboot
a month, during which time I had let him see
in what manner I had provided, with the as-
sistance of Providence, for my support; and
he saw evidently what stool: of corn and rice I
had laid up: which, though it was more than
sutficient tbr myself, yet it was not suficient,
without good husbandry, for my family, now it
was increased to four; but much less would it
be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as
he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over;
and, least ofall, would it be sufficient to victual
our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage
to any of the Christian colonies of America;
so he told me he thought it would be more ad-
viseable to let him and the other two dig and
cultivate some more land, as much as I could
spare seed to sow, and that we should wait
another harvest, that we might have a supply
of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come ; for want might be a temptation to them
to disagree, or not to think themelves deli-
vered, otherwise than out of one difliculty into
another. You know, says he, the children of
Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their
being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even
against God himself, that delivered them, when
they came to want bread in the wilderness.

His caution was so sensonable, and his 1d-
vice so good that I could not but be very well
pleased with his proposal, as well as I was Ia-
tisfied with his fidelity: to we fell to digging
all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we
were furnished with permitted; and in about
a month's time, by the end of which it was
scedtime, we had got as much land cured and
trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty
bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice;
which was, in short, all the need we had to
spare: nor, indeed, did we leave ourselvg
barley sutiicient for our own food, for the six
months that we had to expect our crop; that
isto say, reckoningfrotn the timewe set our

posed itissixtnontbsinthe ground inthat
country.

Havingnew society , and our num-
ber being suficient to put moot of fear of the
savages, if they had come, unless their num-
ber had been very great, we went freely all
over the island, whenever we found occasion;
and as here we had our escape or deliverance
upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least
for me, to have the means of it out of mine.
Forthis purpose, I marked out several trees
which I thought fit for our work, and I set
Friday and his father to cutting them down;
sndthen [cursed the Spaniard, to whom I
imparted my thought on that nfl'air, toovsrsee
and direct their work. I showed them with
what indefitigable pains Ihad hewed a large
tree into single planks, and I caused them to
do the like, till they had made about adozen
large planks ofgood oak, near two feet broad,
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to
four inches thick: what prodigious labour it
took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase
my little flock of tame goats as much as I could;
and, for this purpose, I made Friday and the
Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Fri-
day the next day, (for we took our tum.) and
by this means we got about twenty young kids
to breed up with the rest; for whenever we
shot the darn, we saved the kids, and added
them to our flock. But, above all, the season
tirr curing the grapes coming on, 1 caused such
a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun,
that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where
the raisinsof the sun are cured, we could have
filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with
our bread, was a great partof our food, and
was very good living too, I assure you, for it
is exceeding nourishing.

It was now harvest, andour crop in good
order: it was not the most plentiful increase I
had seen in the island, but, however, it was
enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two
bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed
out above two hundred and twenty bushels,
and the like in proportion of the rice; which
was store enough for our food to the next har~
vest. though all the sixteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or if wohad been readylor
avayage, it would very plentifully have vic-
tuallcd our ship to have carried us toany part
ofthe world, that is to say, any part of Arne-
rica. When we had thus hotned and secured
our magazine ofcorn, we fell to work to males
more wicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which

we kept it; andthe Spaniard was very handy
and dastem at this part, and often blamed

and defend him against all such attempts, and
wherever they went, would be entirer under
and subjected whis command; and that this
should be put in writing, and signed with their
hands. How they were to have done this,
when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was
aqueetiou which we never asked. Under these
instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage,
the father of Friday, went away in one of the
canoes which they might be said to come in,
or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savagea. 1
gave each of them a musket, with a tin-look on
it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of
both,and notto useeitherot' them but upon
urgent ooeasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first
measures used by me, in view of my deliver-
ends, for now twentyoseven years and some
day s. I gave them provisionsot'bread, and of

or inferior and subordinate, is not the ques-

The present question abundantly confirms
ate in the justice of this reasoning; for had I
not been made cautious by this secret admoni-
tion, come itfrorn whence it will, I had been
undone inevilably, and in a far worse condi.
tion than befiwe, as you will see presently.

I sawthoboatdmw necrtheshore,uifthey

me quite fir enough, they did not see the
filth inlet where I formerly landed my rails,
ht run their beaten shore upon the beach, at
itout half a milefrom me, which was very
nappy fir me ; for otherwise they would have
andod justat mydoor,aslniaysay,and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle,
and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, [was fully satie--
fied they were Englishmen, at least most of
them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but
it didnot proveso; there were in all eleven
men, whereof three of them I found were un-
armed, and, as I thought, bound; and when
the first four or five of them were jumped on
shore, they took those three out of the boat,
as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,
aflliction, and despair, even to a kind of extra-
vagance; the other two, I could perceive,
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared
concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree
as the first. I was perfectly confounded at
the sight, and knew not what the meaning of
it should be. Friday called out to me in
English, athell as he could, 0 master! you

think they are going to eat them thenl--Yes,
says Friday, they will eat them--No, no,

other men had liberty to go also whre they

time when I came on shore, and began to
look ahouttne; how I gave myself over for
lost: how wildly I looked round me; what
dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I
lodged in the tree all night,lor fitar of being
devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing,
that night, of the supply I was to receive by
the providential driving of the ship nearer the
land by the storms and tide, by which I have
since been so long nourished and mpported;
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they
were, how near it was. to them, and how
efl'ectually and really they were in a condi-
tion or safety, at the same time that. they
thought themselves lost, and their case despe-
rate. So little do we see before us in the
world, and so much reason have we to depend
dieerfully upon the great Maker of the world,
that he doesnotleave his creatures so abso-
lutely dem'tute, but that, in the worst circum-
stances, they have always eontething to be
thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their
deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even

to their deliverance by the means by
which they seem to be brought to their des-
trnetiut.

atonce, as they lay, and if any was not killed
at the firstvolley, and ofl'ercd to submit, we
might save them, and so put it wholly upon
God's providence to direct the shot. He staid
ve,rymodestly that be was loath to kill them,
ifbecou" help it: buttbattbose two were
le villains, and had been the authors
ot'allthemutinyintheship, and it'they
escaped, we should be undone still; for they
would go on boerd and bring the whole ship's
company, and destroy us all. Well then, says
I, necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the
only way to save our lives. However, seeing
him still cautious ofshedding blood, I told him
thede go thenuelves, and manage as they
found convenient.

In the middle ot'this discourse we heard some
of them awake, and soon atler we saw two of
themon their feet. I asked him if either of
them were the heads of the mutiny? He said
no. Well then, said I, you may let them
escape; and Providence seems to have awak-
ened them on purpose to save themselves.
Now, ssys I, if the rest escape you, it is your
fault. Animated with this, he took the musket
I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in
his belt, and his two comrades with him, with
each a piece in his hand; the two men who
were with him going first, made some noise,
at which one of the seamen who was swske
turned about, and seeing them coming, cried
out to the rest; but it was too late then, for the
moment he cried out they tired; I mean the
two men, the captain wisely ' his own
piece. They had so well aimed their shot at
the men theyknew, that one of them was killed
onthe spot,andt.he otherverymuch wounded;
but not being dead, he started upon his feet,
and called eagerlyforhelp totheother; but
the captain stopping to him, told him itwas too

story is a whole collection of wonders, it
efi'ected him deeply. But when be reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed

he could not speak a word more. After this
communication was at an end, I carried him
and his two men into my apartment, leading

provisions as I had, end showed them all the

As the ship lay almost two leagues frotn the
more, we had a full View of them as they csme,
and a plain sight even of their faces; because
the tide having set them a. little to the east of
the other bout, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had
landed, and where the heat lay; by this means,
I say, we had a full view of them, and the
camain knew the pemns and characters of all
the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there
were three very honest fellows, who, he was
sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,
being overpowered and frightened; but that as
[hr the boatswsin, who, it seem, wss the chief
officer among them, and all the rest, they were
as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and
wereno doubt made desperate in their new
enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was
that they would be too powerful for us. I
smiled at him. and told him that men in our
circumstances were past the operation of fear :
that seeing almost every condition that could

posed to he in, we ought to expect that the

save your life, which elevated you it little while
ago; for my part, said I, there scents to me
but one thing amiss in all the ct of it.
What is that? says he. Why, said I, it is,
that as you say there are three or four honest
fellows Intong them, which should be spared,
had they been all of the wicked partot' the crew
I should have thought God's providence had
singled them out todeliver them into your hands ;
for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore
are our own, snd shall die or live as they be-
have to us. As I spoke this with a raised
voice Ind cheerful countenance, I lound it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously
to our business.

We had, upon the [inn appearance oftho
ooot's coming from the ship, considered of
separating our prisoners; andwe had, indeed,
sound them effectually. Two of them, of
whom the esptsin was less emred titan ordi-
nary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three
delivered men, to my cave, where they were

heard or discovered, or of finding their way
out of the woods if they could have delivered
themselves: here they left them bound, but
gave them provisions; and promised them, if
they continued there quietly, to give them
their liberty in a. day or two; but that ifthey
attempted their escape, they should he put to
death without mercy. They promised faith-
fully to bear their confinement with patience,
and were very thankful that they had such
good usage as to have provisions and light
left them; for Friday gave themcandlea (such
as we made ourselves) for their comibrt; and
they did not know but that he stood sentinel
over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better ; two
of them were kept pinioned, indeed, because
the captain was not free to trust them; but
the other two were taken into my service,
upon the captain's recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with
us; so with them and the three honest men
we were seven men well armed; and I trade
no doubt we should be able to deal well
enough with the ten that were coming, con4
sidering that the captain had said there were
three or four honest men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place when: their
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the
beach, and came all on shore, hauling the
boot up alter them, which I we: glad to see;
for I was afraid they would rather have left
the boat at an anchor, some distnnce from
the shore, with some hands in her, to guard
her, and so we should not be able to seize the
boat. Beingon shove, the first thing theydid,
they ran all to their other .bont; and it was
easv tomtthey were under s great surprise

' to find her stripped, as above, ofsll thnt was

in her, and a greatholein her bottom. Afler
they hsd mused a while upon this, they set up
twoor three great shouts, hallooing with all
their might, to try if they could make their
companions hear; but all wss to no purpose:
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a
volley of their lnall arm, which, indeed, we
hard, and the echoes made thewoodsring;
but it was sll one; those in the cave we were
sure could not hear, and those in our keeping,
though they heard it well enough, yet durst
give no answer to thrm. They were so as-
tonished It the surprise of this, that, as they
told us afterwards, they resolved to go Ill on
board again, to their ship, and let them know
that the men were all murdered, and the'long-
boat staved; accordingly, they immediately

little tree on the shore. This was what I
wished for 3 and immediately leaving Friday
and the captain's mate to their business, I took
the rest with me, and crossing the creek out
of their sight, wentrpdsed the two men before
they were aware; one of them lying on the
shore, and the other being in the boat. The
fellow on shore was between sleeping and
waking, and going to start up; the captain,
wlrowas lbrcmoet, ran in ttpon him,and knocked
him down: and then called out to him in the
bout to yield, or he was a dead man. There
needed very few arguments to persuade a single
man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down; besides, this
was, it scents, one of the three who were not
so hearty in the mutiny as the reetof the crew,
and then-litre was easily perusaded not only to
yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely
with us. In the mean time, Friday and the
captain's mate so well in ed their business
with the rest, that they drew them, by balloo-
iug and answering, from one hill to another,
and fromone wood toanother, till they not only
heartily tired them, but left them where they
were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they were
heartily tired themselves also, by the time they
came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch thr
them in the dark, andtofall uponthem,soas
to make sure work with them. It was several
hours after Friday came back to me before
theyeame back to their boat; and we cottld
bear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along; and could alsohear them answerand
complain how lame and tired they were, and
not able income any faster: which was very
welcome news to us. At length they canto up
tothe boat: but it is impossibletoexpreas their
confusion when they fotmd the boatfast
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two
men gone. We could hear them call to one ano-
ther in a most lamentable manner, telling one
anothertheyweregotintoanenchanted island;
that either there were inhabitants in it, and
they should all be murdered, or else there were
devils and spirits in it, and they should be all
carried away and devoured. They halloood

as I could; andespeeially l waatmwilling to
hawdthe killing any of our men, knowing
the others were very well armed. I resolved
towait, to see if they did not sepamte: and,
therefore, to make one of them, I drew my
unbuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and
the eaptaintooreep upon their hands and feet,
aselose tothe grotmdasthey could, thatthey
might not be discovered, and get as near them
as theyoould possibly, before theyotl'ered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, when
the boatstvain, who was the principal ring-
leader of the mutiny, and had now shown him-
sell'the rnost dejected and dispirited of all the
rest, came walking towards them, with two
more of the crew: the captain was so eager at
having this principal rogue so much in his
power, that he could hardly have patience to
let him come so near as tobe sure of him. fir
they only heard his tongue before: but when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet, let fly ntthetn. The
boatswain was killed upon the spot; the nest
man was shot in the body, and fell just by
him, though he did not die till an hour or two
aflcr; and the third ran for it. At the noise
of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, viz.
myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-
gen'eral; the captain and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted
with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in
the dark,sothat they could not see ournum-
her: andlmade theman they had leftin the
boat, who was nowone of us, to call them by
name,totry ifIcould bringthemto aparley,
and somight perhaps reduce them to terms;
which fell out. just as we desired: for, indeed
itwas to think, as their condition then
was, they would be very willing to eapitulats.

sent to England, they would all be hanged in
chains, to be sure; but that if they would join
in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he
would have tho governor's engagement for
their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a pro-
posal would be accepted by men in their con-
dition; they fell down on their knees to the
captain, and promised, with the deepest impro-
cations, that they would be faithful to him to
the last drop, and that they should owe their
lives to him, and would go with him all over the
world; that they would own him as a father
as long as they lived. "fell, says the captain,
I must go and tell the governor what you say,
and see what I can do to bring him to consent
to it. So be t me an account of the
temper he found them in, and that he verily
believed they would be faithful. However, that
we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back again andehoose out those five, and
tell them, that they might see he did not want
men, that he would take out those five to be his
assistants, and that the governor would keep
the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages
for the fidelity of those five: and that if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hos-
tages should be hanged in chains aliveon the
shore. This looked severe, and convinced
them that the governor was in earnest: how-
ever, they had no way left them but to accept
it; and it was new the business ofthepri-
soners, as much as of the captain, to persuade
the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the
expedition: first, the captain, his mate and
passenger: sooond, the two prisoners of the
first gang, to whom, having their character
from the captain, I had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms: third, the other two
that I had kept till now in my bower pinioned,
but, on the captain's motion, had now released:
fourth, these five rolemd at last: so that they
were twelve in all, besides five we ksptpri-
more in the cave for hostages.

pleasure they should not stir any where but by
my direction: that if they did, they would be
fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so
thataswenever sufl'ered themto seenteasa
governor, I now appeared as another person,
and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difliculty before him,
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of
one, and man them. He made his passenger
captain ofone, with four ofthe men; and him-
self, his mate, and five more, went in the other,
and they contrived their busineu very well, fitr
they came up to the ship about midnight. As
soon as they earns within call ofthe ship, he
made Robinson hail them, and tell them they
had bnmght off the men and the boat, but that
it was a long time befbre they had found them,
and the like, holding them in a chat till they
came to the ship's side; when the captain and
the mate entering first, with their arms, imme-
diately knocked down the second mate and carh
pcnter with the butt end of their muskets,
being very faithfully seconded by their men,-
they secured all the rest that were upon the
main and quarter decks, and began to fasten
the hatches, to keep them down that were
below; when the other boat and their men
entering at tho fore-chains, secured the fore-
castle of the ship, and the scuttle which went
down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners. When this was
done, and all safe upon deck, the captain
ordered the mate, with three men, to break into
the roundhouse, where the new rebel captain
lay, who having taken the alarm, had got up,
andwith two men andaboyhad gotfirearms
in their hands: and when the mate, with a
crow, split open the door, the new captatn and
his men findle them, and wounded
the mate with a muskethall,whieh broke his
arm, and wounded twomore ofthemen, but
killed nobody. The mate calling for help
rushed, however, into thorotmdhouse, wounded
as he was, and with hispistol shot the new
captain the head, the bullet entering

the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned
no they were, tothe bower, and keep them
there till I came. After some time I came
thither dressed in my new habit; and now I
was called governor again. Being all met,
and the captain with me, I caused the men to
be brought before me, and I told them I had
got a full account of their villanous behaviour
to the captain, and how they had ntn away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit
farther robberiea, but that Providence had en-
anared them in their own ways, and that they
were fallen into the pit which they had dug
for others. I let them know that by my di-
rection the ship had been aeized; that the lay
new in the road; and they might see, by and
by, that their new captain had received the
reward of his villany, and that they would see
him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them,
I wanted to know what they had to say tvhy
I should not execute them as pirates, taken in
the fact, as by my commission they could not
doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the
rest, that they had nothing to my but this, that
when they were taken, the captain promised
them their lives, and they humbly implored my
mercy. But I told them I knew not what
mercy to thaw them; for as for myself, I had
resolved to quit the island with all my men,
and had taken o with the captain to go
for England; andaafor the captain, he could
not carry them to England other than as pri-
soners, in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship; the consequence
of which they must needs know, would be the
gallows; so that I could not tell what was best
for them, unless they had a mind to take their
fate in the island; if they desired that, as I
had liberty to leave the island, I had some in-
clination to gite them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They
seemed very thankful for it, and said they
would much rather venture to my there than
be mied toEnglandtobehanged: :01 left
iton that into.

However, the captain seemed to make
some Wty of it, as ifhe that not leave
them there. Upon this I seemed a little
angry with the captain, and told him that
they were my prisoners, not his; and that
neeing I had ofl'ered them so much favour, I
wouldbeaagoodaemyword; andthat if he

very thankful, and I accordingly set them at
liberty, and bade them retire into the woods
to the place whence they came, and I would
leave them some firearms, some ammunition
and some direction: how they ahould live very
well, if they thought tit. Upon thiaI prepareo
togo on boatdthe ship; but told thecaptainl
would etay that night to prepare my things,
and desired-him to go on board, in the mean
time, and keep all right in the ship, and tend
the boat to shore next day {hr me; ordering
him, at all events, to cause the new captain,
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm,
that these men might nee him.

When the captain was gone, I lent for the
men up to me to my apartment, and entered
seriously into discourse with them on their
circumstances. I told themI thought they
had made a right choice; that if the captain
had carried them away, they would certainly
be hanged. I nhowed them the new captain
hanging at the yardoarm of the ehip,and told
them they had nothing lees toexpect.

When they had all declared their willing-
nose to stay, I then told them I would let them
into the story of my living there, and put
them into the way of making it easy to them:
accordingly, I gave them the whole history of
the place, and of my coming to it; showed
them my fortifications, the way I made my
bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and
in a word, all that was necessary to make
them easy. I told them the story also of the
seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected,
for whom I lefl a letter, and made them pro-
mise to treat them in cotnmon with themselves.
Here it may noted, that the captain had ink
on board, who was greatly surprised that I
never hit upon a. way of making ink of char-
coaland water, orofaotneth' else," I had
done thing! much more dificu t. v

I left them my dreams, viz. five tmtaltetl,
three hwlingpiecee, and three words. I had
above a barrel and'ahalfof er left; for
after the first year or two I used but little, and
wanted none. I gave them a deacription of
the way I managed the gone, and directions
to milk and fatten them, and to make both
butterandcheeae: ina word, I gave them
every part (1' my own story; and told them I
should prevail with the captain to leave them
two barrels of gunpowder more, and lame
garden needs, which I told them I would have
been very glad of: also I gave them the bag of
peas whichthe captainhad broughtmetoeat
and bade than be sure to sow and incense
them.

Having done all thinllefl them the next
day, and went on bond the ehip. We pre-
pared immediately to sail, but did not weigh
that night. The next morning early, two of
the five men come swimming to the ship's
side, and making a most lamentehle complaint
of the otha three, begged to be tnlten into the
ship, for God's suite, for they should be mur-
dered, and begged the tain to tnlte them
on board, though be hanged them immedi-
ately. Upon this, the captain pretended to
have no power without me; but sher some
dificulty, and alter their solemn promises of
unendment, they were taken on board, end
were some time after roundly whipped and
pickled: otter which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows. -

Some time aflerthis, the host was ordered
on shore, the tide being up, with the things
promiscdto the men; to which the captain,
at my intercession, conned their chests and
clothes to be added, which they took, and

ROBINSON GOIS 1'0 LISBON, WHERE fill FINDS THE PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN, WHO
REIDEBS HIM AN ACCOUNT OF HIS PROPERTY IN THE BRAZILS.---SETS 0|!"
ON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND BY LAND.

Wants I come to England, I was aspcrl'ect
a stranger to all the world as if I had never
been known there. My benefactor and faith
l'ul steward,whorn I had left my money in trust
With, wee olive, but hedhnd t misfortunes
in the world; was become a widow the second
time, nnd very low in the world. I made
her vary as to what she owed me, assay>>
ing her I would give her no trouble; but, on
the contrary, in gratitude for her former core
and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my
little stock would efl'ord; which, at that time,
would indeed allow me to debut little for her;
but I assured her I would never forget her for>>
mer kindness to me; nordid I forget her when
1 had strificient to help her, as shell be observed
in in proper place. I went down afterwards
into Yorkshire; but my father and mother
were dead, and all the family extinct, except
that I {hund two sisters, endtwo of the chil-
dren ofono ofmybrothers; and as Ihsdbeen
long ago given over for dead, there hnd been
no provision made for me: no that, in e word,

I found nothing to relieve or mist me; and
that the little money I had would not do much
for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed,
which I did not expect; and this was, that
the master of the shtp whom I had so happily
delivered, and by the same meenssnved the
ship Ind enrgo, hnving given a very handsome
account to the owners of the msnner howl
had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet linen, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together mode
me I very handsome compliment upon the
eubject, and a present of almost two hundred
pounds sterling.

But after melting levers! reflections upon
the circumstances of my life, and how little
way ll'tll would go towards eettling me in the
world, Ireeolved logo toLisbon,andsee if I
might not come by some information tithe
etele of my plantotion in the Brazile, and <<I
what was become ofmypartner,who,lhsd
reason to suppose, had some yeen past given
meover for dead. With this view I tool:
shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April
following; layman Friday accompanying me
very honestly in all these ramblings, and prov-
ing s. most faithfitl servantupon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found ottt, by in-
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my
old friend the captain of the ship who first
tool: me up at sea otftbe shore ot'At'rica. He
was new grown old, and had loll otl' going to
am, having put his son, who was farfrorn a
young man, into his ship, and who still used
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know
me; and, indeed, I hardly knew him: but I
soon brought him to my remembrance, and as
soon brought myselfto his remembrance, when
I told him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of the
old acquaintance between us, I inquired, you
may be sure, after my plantation and my part~
ner. Theoldmantoldmehe hadnotbeen in
the Brazils for about nine years; but that he
couldusurorne,thatwhenhecameaway

my partner was living: but the trustees, whom .

I had joined with him totalte izance of
my part, were both dead: that, however, he
believed I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for that
upon the general beliel'of my being cast away
and drowned, my trustees had given in the
account of the produce of my part of the
plantation to the procurntorhfiseal, who had
appropriated it, in case I never came to claim
it, onethird to the king, and twothirds to the
monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended
for the benefit of the poor, and for the conver-
sion of the Indiana to the Catholic faith: but
that if! appeared, or any one for me, to claim
the inheritance, it would be restored; only
that the ' t, or annual production,
being distributed to charitable uses, could not
be restored : but he assured me that the
steward of the king's revenue from lands, and
the proviedore, or steward of the monastery,
had talten great care all along that the incum-
bent, that is to say, my partner, gave every
year a. faithful account of the produce, of
which they had duly received my moiety. I
asked him if he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought the plantation, and
whether he thought it might be worth looking
aller ; or whether,onrny going thither, I should
meet with any 'on to my possessing
my just right in the moiety. He told me he
could not tell exactly to what degree the plan-
tation was improved, but this he knew, that
my [tanner was grown exceeding rich upon

of his remembrance, be had heard that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seem,
granted away to some other or reli-
gious house,arnurntedtoabove two hundred
moidores a year: lhat as to my beingrestored
to aquietpossession of it, therowasnoqueo-
tion to be made of that. my partner being alive
to witness my title, and my name being also
enrolled in the register orthe country: also he
told me, that the mtrvivcrs of my two trustees
were very fair honest people, and very wealthy;
and he believed I would notonly have their
assistance firr putting me in possession, but
would find a very considerable sum of money
in their hands for my account, being the pro-
duce of the farm while their fathers held the
trust, and before it was given up,asahtwe;
which,ashe remembered, wasfor about twelve
years.

I showed myself a little concerned and
uneasy at this account, and inquired of the
old captain how it came to pass that the trus-
tees should thus dispose of my efl'ects, when
he knew that I had made my will, and had
made him, the Portuguese cs tain, my uni-
versal heir, kc. P

He told me that was true; but that as there
was no proof of my being dead, he could not
act as executor, until some certain account'
should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so
remote: that it was true he had registered my
will, and put in his claim: and could he have
given any account of my being dead or alive,
he would have acted by procuration, and taken
possession of tho ingenio, (so they called the
atrgar-house,) and have given his son, who
was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. But,
any: the old man, I have one piece of news to
tell you, which perhaps may not. be so accepta-
ble to you as the rest; and that is, believing
you were lost, and all the world believing no
also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account with me, in your name, for six or eight
of the first years' profits, which I received.
There being at that time great disbursements
for increasing the-works, building an ingenio,
and buyingslares, it did not amount to near so
much as afterwards it produced: however, says
the old man, I shall give M atrue account of
what I have received in all, and how I have
disposed of it.

After a few days farther conference will
this ancient friend, he t me an account

very passionately to come overand take poa-
aeeaionof my own; and, in the mean time, to
give him orders to whom he Ihould deliver my
efl'ccts, if Idid not come myself; concluding
with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that
of his family : and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' sltins, which he had, it mats,
received from Africa, by some other ship that
he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had
made a better vo than I. He sent me
also fire cheats of excellent sweetmcata, and a
hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
large as moidores. By the name fleet, my two
merchant trustees shipped me one thousand
two hundred chest! of sugar, eight hundred
rolls of tobacco, and the rea of the whole
account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter
end of Job was better than the beginning. It
is impossible toexpress the fluttering of my
very heart, when I found all my wealth about
me; forastheBrazil ahipseome allinfleets,
the same ships which brought my letters brought
my goods: and the edicts were safe in the
river bciitre the letters came to my hand. In
a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had
not the old man run and hatched me a cordial,
I believe the sudden surprise of joy had over-
sct nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay,
afler that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for,
and something of the real cause of my illness
being known, he ordered me to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well: but I
verily believe, ifI had not been cased by a
vent given in that manner to the spirits, I
should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above
five thousand pounds sterling in money, and
had an estate, as Imight well call it, in the
Brazils, of aboveathousand pounds a year, as'
sure as an estate of lands in England ; and, in
a word, Itvaa in a emdition which I scarce
knew how to understand, or how to compose
myself for the enjoyment of it. The first
thingI did was to recompense my original
benefhctor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to
me in my beginning, and honest to me at the
end. I showed him all that was sent to
me; I told him, that next to theprovidcnce of
Heaven, which disposed all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him, which I would do a hundred-
fold: so I first returned to him the hundred
moidores I had received of him; than I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a
general release or discharge from'the four hun-

ADVENTUBES 0F ROBINSON CRUBOE.

dndandseventy moidores,which hehadao-
kmwledged he owed me, in the fullest and
firmeat manner possible. After which I
caused a 'on to be drawn, empow-
ering him to be my receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation, and appointing my
partner to awonnt with him, and make the
return by_the usual fleets to him in my name ;
and aelause in the end, being a grant of one
hundred moidores a year to him during his
life, out of the efi'ects, and fifty moidores a
year to his son after him, for his life: and thus
I requited my old man. "

I was now to consider which way to steer
my course next, and what to do with the
estate that Providence had thus put into my
hands; and, indeed, I had more carcupon my
head nowthan I had in my silent state of life
in the island, where I wanted nothing but what
I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ;
whereas I had new a great charge upon me,
and my business vras how to secure it. I had
never a five new to hide my money in, or a
place where it might lie without lock or key,
till it grew mouldyand tarnished before any
body would meddle with it: on the contrary,
I knew not where to put it, or whom totruat
with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I
had. In the next place, my interest in the
Brazil: seemed to summon me thither; but
now I could not tell how to think of going
thither till I had settled my affairs, andlefi my
efl'ects in some safe hands behind me. At
first I thought of my'old friend the widow, who
Iltnew washoneat, and would bejuattome;
but then she was in years, and but poor, and,
for ought I knew, might be in debt; so that,
in a word,I had no way butto gohaek to
England myself, and take my ofi'oots with
me. '

It uu'some months, however, before I ve-
colved upon this; and therefore, as I had ro-
wardcd the old captain fully, and to his satis-
faction, who had becn my former benefactor,
so I began to think of my poor widow, whose
husband had been my first benefactor, and
she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructer. So thefirat thing I
did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a
bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to
talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty,
by telling her she should, if I lived, have a
further supply: at the same time I sent my
two sisters in the country a hundred pounds
each, they being, though not in want, yet no'

be easy; we should soon be past it all; we

so depending upon our guide, we went on.

 

SECTION XXIX.

PBiDAY,S ENCOUNTER "'ITH A BEAR.--ROBIN$0N AND HIS FELLO'V TRAVEL-
LERS ATTACKS!) BY A FLOOR 0? WOLVES--HIS ARRANGEMENT Of HIS AFFAIRS,
AND MARRIAGE AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND.

It was about two hours bn-llire night, when
our guide being something before us. and not
just in sight, out rushed three monstrous
wolvt-s. and after them a bear, out of a hollow
way atlJoining to a thick wood; two of the
wolves made at the guide, and had he been
far bt'filfl' us, he would have beeudcvoured
before we could have helped him; one of them
rustl'ltt'tl upon his horse, and the other attacked
the man witlt that violence, that he ltad not
time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his
pistol, but hallooed and cried out tons most
lustily. My man Friday being next me, I
bade him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of
the man, he halloocd out as loud as the other,
0 master! 0 master! but, like a. bold fellow,
rode directly up to the poor man. and with his
pistol shot the wolf that attacked him, in the

ea .

It was happy for the poor man that it was
my man Friday; fir he having been used to
such creatucs in his country, he had no fear
upon him, but want close up to him and shot
him, as above; whereas. any other of us would
have fired at a further distance, and have per-
haps either missed the wolf or endangered
shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder
man than I; and, indeed, it alarmed all our
company, when, with the noise of Friday's

istol, we heard on both sides the most dismal
howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled
by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us
as if there had been a prodigious number of
them; and perhaps there was not suchafew
as that we had no cause of apprehensions:
however, as Fridayhad killed this wolf, the
other that had fastened upon the horse left him
immediately, and fled, with'out "3% him a'I'Iy
damage, havin happi y asten upon is
head, where thegboescs of the bridle had stuck

in his teeth. But the man was most hurt; for
the raging creature had bit him twice, once in
the arm, and the other time a little above his
knee; and though he had made smut: defence,
he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorderof his horse, when Friday canto up
and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of
Friday's pistol we all mended our pace, and
rode up as fast as the way, which was very
dillicult, would give us leave, to see what was
the matter. As soon as we came clear of the
trees, which blinded us before. we saw clearly
what had been the case, and how Friday had
dis-engaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was
he had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily,
and in such a surprising manner, as that
which followed, between Friday and the bear,
which gave us all, though at first we were sur~
prised and afraid for him, the greatest diver-
sion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy
clumsy creature. and does not gallop as the
wolfdoes, who is swift and light, so he has two
particular qualities, which generally are the
rule of his actions: first,as to men, who are
not his proper prey (he does not. usually at-
tempt them, except they first attack him, un-
less he be excessive hungry, which it is pro-
bable might now be the case, the ground being
covered with snow,) if you do not meddle with
him, he will not meddle with you; but then
you must take care to be very civil to him,
and give him the road, for be is arery nice
gentleman: he will not go a step out of his
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid,
your best way is to look another way, and
keep going on; for sometimes if you stop,
and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he
takes it for an sfl'ront; but if you throw or to.
any thing at him, and it hit! him, though it
were but a hitof stick as big as your finger,
he thinks himself abused, and sets all other
business aside to pursue his revenge, and
will have satid'action in point of honour ;---this
is his first quality: the next is, if he be once
afl'rontod, he will never leave you, night nor
day, till he has his revenge, but fitllows, at a
good round rate, till he overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide,
and when we came up to him, he was helping
him ofi'from his horse, for the man was both
hurt and frightened, when, on a. whim, we
cspied the bear come out of the wood, and a
vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far
that ever I saw. "N: were all a little sun
prised when we saw him; but when Friday
saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage
in the follow's countenance; 0, 0,0! says
Friday, three times, pointing to him; 0 mos-
ter! you give me to leave, me shakes to hand
with him; me makeo'you good laugh.

I was surprised to see the fellow so well
pleased: You tool, says I, he will eat you up.
--Euteo me up! eatee me up! says Friday,
twice over again; rne eatee him up; me
maltt'o you good laugh; you all stay here, me
show you good laugh. So down he sits. and
gets otl' his boots in a moment, and puts on a
pair of pumps, (as we call the flat shoes they
wear. and which he had in his pocket,) gives
my other servant his horse,and with his gun
away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking sollly on, and ofl'ered
to meddle with nobody, till Friday coming
pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could
understand him, Hark ye, hark ye, says Fri-
day, me speakee with you. We followed at
adistanee; for now being come down on the
Gascony side of the mountains, we were on-
tered a vast forest, where the country
was plain and pretty open, though it had many
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday,
who had, u we say, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a.
great stone and throws it at him, and hit him
juston the head, but did him no more harm
than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it
amwered Friday's end, for the rogue was so
void of fearthatho did it purely to make the
bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as
heealled it. Asaooa asthebearfchthe
blow, and saw him, he turns about, and comes
alter him, taking devilish long strides, aml
shuming on at a strange rate, so u would
have put a horse to a middling gallop; away
rttasFridsy,and takesbisoourseasifhertm
towardsm for help; so we all resolvco to tire
at once upon the bear and deliver lnl nan.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

though I was angry at him heartily for bring-
ing the bear back upon us, when he was going
about his own business another way; and en-
pecinlly I was angry that he had turned the
bear upon us, and then run away; and I called
out, You dog, is this your making us laugh?
Come away, andtake your horse, that we may
shoot the creature. He heard me, andcriod
out, No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you
get much laugh; and as tho nimble creature
run two feet for the bear's one, he turned on a
sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great
oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us
to follow; and doubling his pace, he gets nim-
bly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or six yards from the
bottom of the tree. The bear mm came to
the tree, and we followed at a distance: the
first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt
to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into
the tree, climbing like a cat, though so mon-
strous heavy. I was amazed at the fully, as I
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life
see any thing to laugh at yet, till seeing the
bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.
l'Vhen we came to the tree, there was Fri-
day got out to the small end of a large branch,
and the bear got about half way to him. As
soon as the bear got out to that part where
the limb of the tree was weaken--Ha! says
he to us, new you see me teachee the bear

bough, at which the bear began to toner, but
stood still, and began to look behind him, to
see how he should get back: then, indeed,
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal: when seeing
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if
he had supposed the bear could speak English,
What, you come no farther? pray you come
farther: so he left jumping and shaking the
tree; and the bear, just as if he understood
what he said, did come alittle farther; then
he fell a jumping again, and the bear stopped
again. We thought now was a good time to
knock him onlhe head, and called to Friday
to stand still, and we would shoot the bear:
but hecriedout earnestly,0 pray! O pray!
no shoot, me shoot by and then; he would
have said by and by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the
bear stood so tieltlials, that we had liughzg

and gently leta himself down by it, sliding
down the bough, till he came near enough to
jump down on h'n feet, and away he runs to
his gun, takes it up, and stand: etill. Well,
said I to him, Friday, what will you do.now?

when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes

mighty cautiously, looking behind him every
step, and coming backward till he got into the
body of the tm; then with the name hinder-
end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving onel'oot at I time,
very leisurely. At this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind~foot on theground,
Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the
muule of his pioce into his ear, and Ihot
him dead. Then the rogue turned about, to

for we were all armed with e fusee sad I
pairof pistols each man; so we were, by this
method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at
I. time: however, at. present we had no ne-
mity: for upon firing the first volley, the
enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well
with the noise as with the fire; four of them,
being shot in the heed, dropped; several
others were wounded, lndwent bleeding off,
as we could see by the snow. I found they
stopped, but did not immediately retreat;
whereupon, remembering that I had been told
that the fiercest ere-lures were terrified at
the voice of rt man, I caused all tlte company
to halloo asloud as weeould; and [found
the notion not altogether mistrdten; for upon
outshout, they began to retire, and turn about.
I then ordered a second volley to be fired in
their rear, which put them to the gallop, and
away they went to the woods. This gave us
leisure to charge our pieces again: and that
we might lose no time, we kept going: but
we had but little more then loaded our limes,
and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard
a, terrible noise in the some word, on our
left, only that it was further onward, the some
way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the light
begun to be dusky, which made it worse on
our side; but the noise incressing, we could
easily perceive that it was the howling and
yelling, of those hellish creatures; and on a
sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves, one on our lel'l, one behind us, and one
in our front. so that we seemed to be mn-
rounded with them: however, as they did not
fell upon us, we kept our way forward, as first
as we could make our horses go, which, the
way being very rough, was only I good hard
trot. In this manner we came in view of the
entrance of a wood, through which we were to
pass, at the farther side of the plain; but we
were greatly surprised, when coming nearer
the lane or pass, we sew a confused number
of wolves standing just at the entrance. On
a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise oft: gun, and looking that way,
out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle
on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or
seventeert wolves after him, full speed; indeed,
the horse had the heels of them, but as we
supposed that he could not hold it at that rate,
we doubted not but they would get up with him
at laat; no question but they did.

But here we had s most horrible sight; for

ADVENTURES OI" ROBINSON CRUSOE.

And of two men, devoured by the revenu-
creatures; and one ofthe mums no dorm
the same whom we heard fire the gun, furthers
laya gun just hyhimfied of; but as to the
man, his head and the upperpart of his body
were eaten up. This filled us with horror,
and we knew not what course to take; bttt
the creatures resolved us soon, for they go.-
tin-red about us presently, in hopes of prey;
and I verily believe there were three hundred
of them. It happened very much to our ad~
Vuntngo, that at the entrance into the wood,
but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber trees, which had been cut down the
summer before, and I suppose lay there for
carriage. I drew my little troop in among
those trees, and placing ourselves in a line
behind one long tree, I advised them all to
slight, and keeping that tree bclbre us for a
breastwortt,to stuttd in a triangle or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre. We did
so, and it was well we did; for never win I
more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place. They came on with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece
of timber, which, as I said, was our breast-
work, as if they were only rushing upon their
prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was
principally occasioned by their seeing our
horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire
as bethre, every other man: and they took
their aim so sure, that they killed several of
the wolves at the first volley; but there was e
necessity to keep a continual firing, for they
came on like devils, those behind pushingtls
those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our
fusees, we thought they stopped a little, and
I hoped they would have gone off; but it was
but a moment, for other: cnme fotwnrd again;
so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I
believe in these fitur firings we hed killed
seventeen or eighteen of them, and lsmed
twice as many, yet they earns on again. I
was loath to spendourshot too hastily: so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for
he was better employed, for, with the great-
est dexterity imaginable, he hsd charged my
fusee and his own while we were engaged;
but, as I said, I celled my other man, and
giving him I horn of powder, I bade him lny
a train all along the piece of timber, end let
it boa lsrgo train. He did so; and bed but
just time to getaway, when the wolmeune

Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils,
yet I could not keep the country out of my
head; nor could I resist the strong inclination
I had to seemy island. My true friend, the
widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so
far prevailed with me, that, for almost seven
years, she prevented my running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my
care: the eldest having something of his own,
I bred up as a gentleman, and gnve him aset-
tlement of some addition to his estate, alter
my decease. The other I put out too cap-
tain of a ship: and after five years, finding
him asensible, bold, enterprising young fellow,
I puthim into a good ship, and sent him to sea:
and this young fellow afterwards drew me in,
as old as I was, to farther adventures myself.

In the mean time, I in part settled myself
here ;KoSSfirst of all,I married, and that not
either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction,
and had three children, two sons and one
daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew
coming home with good success from avoyage
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunity prevailed,and engaged me to
go in his ship as a private trader to the East
Indies: this was in the year 1694.

But these things, with some very surprising
incidents in some new adventures of my own,
tor ten years more, I shall give a farther ao-
count of.

That homely proverb used on so many oo-
casions in England, viz. " That what is bred
in the bone, will not go out of the flesh,"
was never more verified than in the story of
my life. Any one would think, that alter

of all things, grown old, and when, if over, it
might be allowed me to have had experience
of every state of middle life, and to know
which was most adapted to make a man com-
pletely happy; I say, alter all this, any one
would nave thought that the native propensity
to rambling. which I gave an account of in
my first setting out in the world to have been
so predominant in my thoughts, should be
worn out, the volatile part be fully evacuated,
oral. least condensed, and I might, at sixty-
one years ofage, have been a little inclined to
stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fortune any more.

Nay, farther, the common motive of lbreign
adventures was taken away in me; {or I had
no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek:
if I had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been
no richer; for I had already sufficient for me,
and for those I had to leave it to; and that I had
was visibly increasing; for having no great
family, I could not spend the income of what
I had, unless I would set up for an expensive
way of living, such as a great family, servants,
equipage, gayety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so
that I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still,
and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it in-
crease daily upon my hands. Yet all these
thing; had no effect upon me, or at least not
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to
go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronieol distemper. In particular, the desire
ofsoeing my new plantation in the island, and
the colony I left there ran in my head cort-
tinually. I dreamed of it all night, and my
imagination ran upon it all day; it was upper
most in all my thoughts; and my fancy worked
so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked
of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could re-
move it out of mind: it even broke so violently
into all my discourses, that it made my eon-
versation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing
else; all my dbcourao ran into it, even to
impertinence ; and I saw it in myself;

SECTION XXX.

HE. IS SIIZID WITH A DISIRI 1'0 REVISI'I' HIS ISLAND-LOSE! HIS WIn--IS
TEMP!!!) 1'0 00 TO 8" AGAIN.--TAKES OUT A CARGO FOR HIS COLONY.

I luv: ollen heard persons ofgood judg-
ment say, that All the stir people make in the
wurhl lbotll ghosts and nppnritions, is owing
to the strength of imagination, and the power~
ful operation of fancy in their minds; that
there is no such thing as n spirit appearing,
or a ghost walking, and the like: that people'-
poring nfl'ectionatcly upon the past conversa-
tiun of their deceased friends, so realises it to
them, that they are eapnble of feneying, upon
some extraordinary circumslancos,that they sets
them, talk to them, and are answered by tltenr,
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow
and vapour in the thing, and they really ltnow
nothing of the mutter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whe-
Iher there are any such things as real appari-
tions, spectres, or walking of people after they
are dead; or whether there is any thing in the
stories they tell us of that ltind, more than the
product of vapours, sick minds, and wandering
fancies: but this I know, that my imagina-
tion worked up to such a height, and brought
me into such excess of vapours, or what else
I may call it, that I actually supposed myself
olien upon the spot, at my old castle. behind
the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's
father, and the reprobate sailors I lell. upon
the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them,
and looked at them steadily, though I was
brood awoke, as at just before me;
and this I did till I often frightened myself
' with the images my fancy represented to me.

One time, in my sleep, I had the villany of the
three pirate sailors so lively related to me by
the first Spaniard and Fridsy's father, that it
was surprising; they told me how they barba-
rously attempted to under all the Spaniards,
sud that they set fire to the provisions they
hadlaid up,on ptapeaeto distressandstsrve
them: things thsthad never heard ol',and
that indeed wereneversllot'thent truetn
fact; but it was so warminmy imagination,
andsorealised tome, that, totbehourlsaw
them, I could not be ed but that it
was,or wouldbe,true; also how Iresentedit,
when the Spaniardoomplsined tome;andhow
I brought them to justice, tried them before
me, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
What terewasreally inthis. shall beseenin

its place: for however I came to form such
things in my dream, and whet secret converse
ofspirils injected it, yet there was, I say, much
of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing
in it literally and specifically true: but the
general part was so true, the base villsnous
behaviour of these threo hardened ues was
such, and had been so much worse than allI
can describe, that the dream had too much
aimilitudo of the fact; and as I would afterh
wards hsve punished them severely, so, if I
had hanged them all, I had been much in the
right, and even should have been justified
both byth laws JGod and man. Butte
return to my story: In this kind oftemper I
lived some ; I had noenjoytnent ofrny
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diver-
sion, but what had something or other ofthis
in it; so that my wife, who saw my mind
wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously
one night, that she believed there was some
secret powerful impulse of Providence upon
me, which had determined use to go thither
again: and that she found nothing hindered
my going, but my being engaged to a wife and
children. She told me, that it was true she
could not think of parting with me; but as
she was naked, that if she was dead it
would be thefustthingI woulddo; so, as it
seemed to her that the thing was determined
above, she would notbe the onlyobetruction;
for, if I thought fit, and resolved to go--
}Iero she thund me very intent upon her words,
and that I looked very earnestly at her, so
that it a little disordered her, and she stopped.
I askedher, why she did not go on,andsay
outwhstshe was going to say? Butlper-
eeivedthat her hesrtwss toofitll,snd some
tears stood in her eyes. Speak out, In dear,
said I; are you willing I should go. No,
says she, very atl'eetiooately, I am far from
willing; butif you are resolved to go, says
she,sndrstbertban l wouldbetheonlyhin-
derance, I will go with you: for though I
think it a most preposterous thing for one of
your years, and in your condition, yet, if it
must be, said abs, again weeping, I would
not leave you; for, if it be of Heaven, you
must do it; there is no misting it: and it'
Heaven make it your duty to go, he will also
make it mine to go with you, or otherwise
dispose oftne, tltat I may not. obstmct it.

This alfectionato behaviour of my wife's
brought me a little out of the vapours, and I
began to consider what I was doing; Icor~
rected my wandering fancy, and began to
argue with myself sedate-1y, what business I
had, after threesoore years, and after such a
life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and
closed in so happy and easy a manner; I say,
what business had I to rush into new hazards,
and put myself upon adventures fit only for
youth and poverty to run into?

With those t in: I considered my new
engagement: that I ltad a wife, one child
hem, and my wife then great with child 0'
amthcr: that I had all the. world could give
me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain;
that lives declining in years. and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than
of seeking to increase it; that as to what my
wife had said of its being an impulse from
Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go,
I ltad no notion ofthat: so, after many oftJteso
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my
imagination, reasoned myself out of it, ns'I
believe people may always do in like cases
if they will: and, in a wurd,l conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments as oo-
curcd to my thoughts, and which my present
condition furnished me plentifully with; and
particularly, as the roost effectual method, I
resolved to divert myself with other things,
and to engage in some business that might
ell'ectually tie me up from any more excur-
sinus of this kind; forI found that thing re.
turn upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had
nothing to do, nor any thing of moment im--
mediately before me. To this purpose I
bought a little farm in the county of Bedford,
and resolved to remove m thither. I had
a little convenient house upon it; and the land
about it,I found, was capable of great im-
provement; and it was many ways suited to
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating,
managing, planting, and improving of land;
and panicularly, being an inland country, I
was removed from convening among sailon,

andthings relating tethe tome parts of the
world.

In a ward, I went down to my farm, settled
my family, bought me ploughs, barrows, a cart,
wagon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting

agreeablelife that nature was capable of direct-
ing, or that a man always bred to misfortune!
was capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent
to pay, was limited by no articles; I could
pull up or cut down as I pleased: what I
planted was for myself, and what I improved
was fi-r my family; and having thus lefl oi?
the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least
diflrnmfurt in any part. of life as to this world.
Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the mid-
dle state of life which my fallterwoarncstly re-
commended to me, and lived a kind of hea-
venly life, sotncthinglihe what is described by
the poet, upon the subject of a country life--

 

" Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one
blow from unseen Providence unhingcd me at
once; and not only tnade a breach upon mu
inevitable and incumhlc, but drove me, by its
consequences, into a deep relapse of the wan-
dering disposition. which, as I may say, being
born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold
of me, and, like the returns of a violent dis-
temper, count on with an irresistible force
upon me, so that nothing could make any
more impression upon me. This blow was
the loss of my wife. It is not my business
here to write an elegy upon my wife. give a
character of her particular virtues, and make
my court to those: by the flattery of a funeral
sermon. She "In, in aft-w words, the stay
of all my afl'airs, the centre of all my criter-
prises, the engine that, by her prudence, re-
duced me to that happy compass I was in
from the most extravagant and ruinous project
that fluttered in my head, as above, and did
more to guide my rambling genius than a mo-
ther's tears, a father's imtructions, a friend's
counsel, or all my own reasoning powers,
wild do. I was happy in listening to her
tears, and in being moved by her cntreaties;
e desolate and dislocated
in the world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awk-
wardly roundme. I was as much a stranger
in it, in my thoughts, as I was intbe Brazils,
when I first went onshore there; and as
much alone, cxeeptas to the assistance of
servants,uI was inmy island. Iknew
neither what to thinknorwhat to do. I saw
thoworldbusyarotmdme; onepartlabouring
for bread, another part laundering in vile
excesses or empty plums, equally miss-
rable,because the endtbeyproposedrtillfled
fiomthent; tort'iemenofplemtreeveryday
mrfeited of their vice, and heaped up work
for sorrow and repentance: and the men of
labour spent their strength in daily struggling
forbread to maintain the vital strength they
laboured with: so living in a daily circulation
of sorrow, living but to work, and working but
to live, as if daily bread were tlte only end of
wearisome life. and a weariaome life the only
occasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in
my kingdom, the island; where I sufl'ered no
more com to grow, because I did not want it:
and bred no more goats, because Ihad no
more use for them; where the money lay in
the drawer till it grew tnouldy, and had scares
the favour to be looked upon in twenty years.

All these things, had I improved them as I
ought to have done, and as reason and reli-
gion had dictated to me, would have taught
me to search farther than human enjoyment:
for a full felicity; and that there was some
thing which certainly was the reason and end
of life, superior to all these things, and which
was either to be possessed, or at least hoped
for, on this side the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was
like a ship without a pilot, that could only
run afore the wind: my thoughts ran all away
again intotho old affair; my head was quite
turned with the whimsies of foreign adven-
tureshand all the pleasant, innocent amuse-
ments of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and
my family, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and were
like music tonne that has no ear, or food to
one that has no taste: in a word, I resolved to
leave of housekeeping, let my farm, and re-
turn to London; and in afew months after, I
did so.

When I came to London, I was still as tut--
easy asI washeforo; I had no relish lilf the
place, no employment in it, nothing to do but
to saunter about like an idle , of whom
it may be said heis perfectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one fat-thing's matter to
therest ofhishind whether he be dead it
alive. This alsowaa the thing which,ol' all
circumstances of life, was the most my aver-
sion, who had been all my days used to an
active life; aisd I would ofien say to myself,
A state ol'idleness 'utha very dregs oflife:
and indeedI thought I was muchmore mit-
ably employed when I was twenty-six days
making me a deal board.

before,I had brought up to the sea, and had

home from a short voyage to Bilbaa, being the
first he had made. He came to me, andtold
me that some merchants of his acquaintance
had been proposing to him to go a voyage for
them to the Elm Indies and to China, as pri-
vate tradeta.-And now, uncle, says he, if
you will go to sea with me, I will engage to
land you upon your old habitation in the island ;
for we are to touch at Ihe Bruits.

Nothing can be a greater dalmatian or
a future state, and of the existence of an in-
visible world, than the concttrrenca of second
causes with the idoas of things which we form
in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not com-
municatd to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my dis-
temper of wandering was returned upon me,
and I knew nothing of what he had in his
thought to say, when that very morning, he-
ibre he came to me. I had, in a great deal of
confusion of thought, and revolving every part
of my circumstances in my mind, come to
this resolution, viz. that I wouldgo to Lisbon,
and consult with my old so ain; and so,
if it was rational and practicable, I would
no and set: the island again, and see what was
become of my people there. I had pleased
myself with the thoughts of peoplingthe place,
and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting
a patent for the ion. and I knew not
What,- when, in the middle of all this, in comes
my nephew, asI have said, with hisproject of
carrying me thither in his way to the East
Indies.

I paused awhile at his words, and. looking
steadily at him, \V'hat devil, said I, sent you
on this unlucky errand ? My nephew stared,
as if he had been frightened, at first; but
perceiving that I was not much displeased
with the proposal, he recovered himself. I
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,
sayshe; [dare say you wouldbopleasedto
see your new colony there, where you once
reigned with more felicity than most of your
brother-monarchs in the world.

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with
my temper, that is to say, the propose-ion
I was under, and of which I have said so
much.-that I told him, in a few words, if he
agreed with the merchants I wodd go with
him: but I told him I would not promise to
go any farther than my own island. Why.
tinny: he, you don't want who leflthm
again, I hope? Why.said I;can you not
takameup again onyour return! He told
meitwoulduotbepoasibletodono; thatthe

Thiswas veryratiooal; btuwehothfound
out a remedy for it', which was, to carry a
framed sloop on board theship, vibidt being
taken in pieou, and shipped on board the ship,

we edtocarrywithus,besotupagainin
theisland,snd finished,titto goto sea, ina

I was not long resolving; for indeed the
importttnities of my nephew joinedso efl'ec-
tually with my inclination, that nothing could
oppose me; on the other hand, my wife being
dead, I had nobody concerning themselves so
much formeas topersuodelnetoone way or
the other, except my ancient good friend the
widow. who earnestly struggled with me to
consider my years, my easy circumstances,
and the needles hazards ofa long voyage;
end, above all, my young children. But it
was all to no ;--I had an irresistil'de
desire to the voyage ; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in the im-
pressions I had upon my mind for the voyage,
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence
if I should attempt to stay at home: afler
which she ceased her expostulations, and
joined with me, not only in making provision
for my voyage, but also in settling my fsmily-
afl'airs for my absence, and providing for the
education of my children.

In order to this, I made my will, and settled
the estate I had in such a rnannerlbr my
children, and placed in such hands, that I was
perfectly easy and satisfied they would have
justice done them, whatever might befall me:
and for their education, I loll. it wholly to the
widow, with a sufficient maintenance to her-
self for hercare: all which she richly deserved,
fornomother could have taken more care in
their education, or understood it better: and
as she lived till I came home, I aho livedto
thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the
beginning of January IBM-5 ; and I, with my
man Friday, went on board in the Downs the
8th: having, besides that sloop which I men-
tioned above, a very miderahle cargo of all
kindsofnecesearythingsfor my colony; which,

to leave so.

Contrary winds first put us to the northward,
and we were obliged to put in at Galway in
Ireland, where we lay windbound two-and-
twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with
the disaster, that provisions were here exceed-
ing cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that
while we lay here, we never touched the ship's
stores, but rather added to them. Here, also, I
took in several live hogs, and two cows, with
their calves; which I resolved, if I had a good
passage, to put on shore in my island; but we
tbund occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

WI: set out on the 6th of February from
Ireland, and had a very fair gale of wind thr
some days. As I remember, it might be about
the 20th of February, in the evening late,
when the mate, hevin the watch, came into
the roundhouse, and to d us he saw a flesh of
fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was
telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the
boatswein heard mother. This made us all
run out upon the querterdeclt, where, for a while,
we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we
saw avery great light, and found that there
was some very terrible fire at a distance: im--
mediately we had recourse to our reckonings,
in which we all agreed, that there could be no
land that way in which the fire showed itself,
no, not for five hundred leagues, for it ap-
peared at W. N. W. Upon this we con-
cluded it must be some ship on fire at sea;
and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just
before, we concluded that it could not be far
03', we stood directly towards it, and were
presently satisfied we should discover it, he-
canse, the farther we sailed, the greater the
light appeared; though, the weather being
hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the
light for a while. In about half In hour's,
sailing, the wind being fair for us, though not
much ofit, and the weathercleenngupa
little, we could plainly discern that it wasa
great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea.

Iwas most sensibly touched with this dis-

. aster, though not at ali acquaifitsd Willhmudd
persons engagedin it: presen y reoo
my former circumstances, and in what condi.
tionI was in, when taken up bythe Portu-

guese captain; and how much more deplora~
ble the circumstances of the poor creamres
belonging to that ship must be, if they had no
other ship in company with them. Upon
this, I immediately ordered that five guns
should be fired, one soon after another; that,
if possible, we might give notice to them that
there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their
boat; for though we could see the flames of
the ship, yet they, it being night, could see
nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving
as the burning ship drove, waiting for day-
light; when, on a sudden, to our great tenor,
though we had reason to expect it, the ship
blew up in the air; and immediately, that is
to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out,
that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This
was a terrible and indeed an afiiicting sight,
forthe sake ofthepoor men; who, Icom
eluded, must eitherbeall destroyed in the ship,
or bein the utmost distress in their boat, in the
middle of the ocean; which, at present, by
reason it was dark, I could not see. How-
ever, to direct them as well as I could, I
calmed lights to be hung out inall the puts
ofthe ship where we could, and which we had
lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long; letting them know, by this, that there
was a shipnot far ofl'. '

About eight o'clock in the mornin , we dis-
covered the ship's boots by the hep of our
perspective glasses; found there were two of
them,both thronged withpeoplo,anddeepm the
water. We perceived they rowed, the wind
being against them; that they saw our ship,
and did their utmost to snake us see them.

life immedtately spread our aim. to let
them know we saw them, and hung a waft out,
as a signal for them to come on board; and
then made more sail,statt<ling directly to them.
In a little more than half an hour, we came
up with them; and in a word. took them all
in, being no less than sixty-four men, women,
and children; for there were a great many
passengers.

Upon the whole, we found it was a French
merchant-ship of three hundred tons, hunte-
bound front Quebec, in the river of Canada.
The master gave us a long account of the
distress ofhis ship; how the fire began in tlte
steerage, by the negligence of the stectsman;
but on his crying out lbr help, was, as every
butly thought, entirely put out; but they soon
found that some sparks of the first tire had
gotten into some part of the shipso difl'tcult to
come at, that they could not effectually quench
it; and afterwards getting in between the tim-
bers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it
proceeded into the hold, and mastered all the
skill and all the application they were able to
exert.

They had no more to do then, but to get
into their boats, which to their great comfort,
were pretty large; being their longboat, and
I great shallop, besides a small skifl', which
was of no great service to them, other than to
get some fresh water and provisions into her,
after they had secured their lives from the
fire. They had, indeed, small hope of their
lives by getting into these boats, at that die-
tanee from any land; only, as they said well,
that they were escaped from the tire, and a
possibility that some ship might happen to be
atsea, and might take them in. They had
sails, oars, and a compass: and were pre-
paring to make the best of their way back to
Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty fair,
for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They
had as much provision and water, as, with
sparing it so as tobe next door to starving,
might support them about twelve days; in
which, if they had nobad weather, and no
contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he
might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and
might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them
till they might goonshore. But there were so
many chances against them in all these cases,
such as storms, to overset and founder them;
rains and cold, to beneath and perish their
limbs; contrary winds, to keep them out and
starve them; that it must have been nestle

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CBUBOE.

In the midst oftheir consternation, every
one being hopeless and ready to despair, the
captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they
were on ssudden ' with the joy of
hearing a gun fire, and after that four more;
these were the five which I caused to be
firedatlirstseeingthc light. This revived their
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as
above, I desired it should. viz. that there was
a ship at hand for their help. It was upon
the hearing of these guns, that they took down
their toasts and sails: the sound coming from
the windward, they resolved to lit>lry till
morning. Some time after this, hearing no
more guns, they fired three mush-ts, one a
considerable while after another; but these,
the wind being contrary, we never heard.

Sumo time after that again, they Were still
more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights,
and hearing the guru which, as I have said,
I caused to be fired all the rest of the night;
tltis set them to work with their oars, to ltcL'p
their boats ahead, at least,that we might the
sooner come up with them; and, et last, to
their inexprcasihle joy, they found we saw
them.

it is impossible for me to express the several
gestures, the strange ecstasies. the variety of
postures, which these poor delivered people
ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are
easily described; sighs, tears, groans, and a
very few motions of the head and hands, make
up the sum of to variety; but an excess of
joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extrava-
gance: in it: there were some intenrs; some
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some
stark raving, and downright lunatic : some ran
about the ship stamping with their fe'et, others
wringing their hands; some were dancing,
some singing, some laughing, more crying;
many quite dumb, not able to speak a word:
others sick and vomiting; several mooning,
and ready to faint; and a few were crossing
themselves, and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there
might be many that were thankful afterwards,
but the passion was too strong for them at
first, and they were not able to master it: they
were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of
fienzy: and it was huts very few that were
composed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps, also, the case may have some
addition to it from the particular circumstance
of that nation they belonged to; I mean the
French, whose temper is allowed to be more
volatile, more passionate, and more spt-igl'aly
andtheirspirits more fluid,than in otherna-
tiorts. I am not philosopher swigh to de-
termine the cause: but nothing I had ever
seen before came upto it. The ecstasies poor
Friday, my trusty savsae, was in, when he
found his father in the boat, came the nearest
to it; and the surprise ofthe master and his
two companions, whom I delivered from the
villain that set them on shore in the island,
came a little way towards it; but nothing was
to compare to this, either that 1 saw in Fri<
day, or any where else in my life.

It is further observable that these extrava-
gances did not show themselves, in that dif-
ferent mannerl have mentioned, in different
persons only; but all the variety would appear,
in a short succession ofmoments, in one and
the some person. A man that we saw this
minute dumb, and as it were stupid and con.
founded, would the next minute bo dancing
and hallooing like an antic; and the next mo-
ment be tearing his hair, orpulling his clothes
to pieces, and stamping them under his feet,
like a madman; in a few moments after that,
we would have him all in tears, then sick,
mooning, and, had not immediate help been
had, he would in a few moments have been
dead: and thus it was, not with one or two,
or ten or twenty, but with thegrestest part of
them: and, if I remember right, our
was obliged tolet blood of about thirty of
them.

There were two priests among them, one
an old man. and the other a young man; and
that which was strangest wns, tho oldest man
wnstho worst. As soonnsheaot hisfoot
on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he
droppeddownstonedead,toallap e;
not the leastsign oflife could be perceived in
him: our surgeon immediately applied proper
remedies to recover him, and was the only
men in the ship that believed he was not
dead. At length he opened a vein in his arm,
having firatchafed and mbbedthopargsoas

blood, whidt only dropped at first, flowing flee-
ly, inthree minutes atler themanoponed his
eyes; and aquarter ofan hotrraflerthathe
spoke, grow better, and in alittlo time quite

about; told us he was perfectlywell; tooka

and again this put him into an ecstasy ol'joy ;
his spirits whirled about faster than the ves-
lels could convey them, the blood grew hot and
feverish,nnd the men won as fit for Bedlamas
any creature that ever was in it: the surgeon
would not bleed him again in that condition,
but gave him something to dose and put him
to sleep, which, at'tersoma time, operated upon
him, and he awoke next morning perfectly
Composed and well.

The younger priest behaved with great
command of his passions, and was really an
example of a serious, well governed mind: at
his first coming on board the ship, he threw
himself flat on his face. prostrating himself in
thankfulneas for his deliverance, in which I.
unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him,
really thinking he hadbeen in a swoon; but
he spoke calmly. thanked me, told me he was
giving God thanks for his deliverance; begged
me to leave him a few moments, and that,
:12: to his Maker, he would give me thanko
I was heartily sorry that l disturbed him,
and not only left him, but kept others from in-
terrupting him also. He continued in that
posture about three minutes, or litle more,
afterllefi him; then came tome, as be had
said he would, and, with a great deal of scri-
ousnees and afl'ection, but with tsarsin his
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, givaa

Alter this, the young priest applied himself
to his wintry-folks; laboured to compose
tliem; persimded, entreated, argued, reasoned
with them, anddid his utmost to keep them
within the exercise of their reason: and with
eornehe had success, though others were for
a timeout of all ernment of themselves.

were in a deplorable condition: Nay, says
he.l believe they are dead, for I have heard
nothing of them for above two days; and I
was afraid II) inquire after them, said he, for
I had nothing to relieve them with.

\Ve iuInII-tliately applied ourselves to give
them what re-litfue could spare ; and, indeed,
I had so far I)\t' rrult-d things II Ith Inv nephew,
that 1 would have vic tilled tltcm though we
had gone awa_\ to Virginia. or any other part
of the coast of America, to have supplied oun-
se.vt-s: but there was no necestity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for
Ih - ~ vere afraid of eating too much, even of
that ulo we gave them. The male or corn-
nIandt-r brought six men with him in his boat;
but these poor wretches looked like skeletons,
and were so weak, that they could hardly sit
to their oars. The mate himself was very ill,
and half-starved; for he declared he had re-
served nothing from the men, and went share
and share alike with them in every bit they ate.

1 cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set
meat before him immediately; and he. had not
eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be
sick, and ottt of order: so he stopped a while,
and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth. which he said would he to him
both food and physio; and after he had taken
it, he grew better. In the mean time. I forgot
not the men: I ordered vietuals to be given
them; and the poor creatures rather devoured
than ate it: they were so exceeding hungry,
that they were In a kind ravenous, and had no
command of themselves; and two of them ate
with so much greediness, that they Ivere in
danger oftlIeir lives the next IIIorning.

The sight of these people's distress was
very moving to me, and brought to mind what
I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming
on shore III my island, where I had neIcr the
least mouthful of food. or any prospect of pro-
curing anv ' besides the hourly apprehensions
Iliad of heme made the f )0d of other crea-
tures. But all the while the matc was thus
relating to me the miserable condition of the
ship's company, I could not put out of my
thought the story he had told me of the three
poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the
mother. her son, and the maidservant, whom
he had heard nothing of for two or three days,
and whom, he seemed to confess, they had
wholly neglected, their own extremities being
so great ' by which I understood, that they had
really given them no food at all, and that
therefore they must be perished, and be all
lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of
the cabin.

 

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CBUSOE-

As I therefore kept. the mate, whom we
then called captain, on board with his men, to
refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving
crew that were left on board; but ordered my
own boat to go on board the ship, and, with
my mate and twelve men, to carry them a
sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef
to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to
cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed
and to keep guard in the cook-room, to pre:
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or takin
it out of the pot before it wu well boiled, and
then to give every man but a very little at a
time: and by this caution he preserved the
men, who would otherwise have killed IlIt'nI-
selves with that very Rmd' tat was given them
on purpose to save their lives.

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go
into the, great cabin, and see what ('tllltlillun
the poor passengers were in; and if they were
alive, to comfort them, and give them what
refreshment was proper: and the stI Ieon
gave him a large pitcher. with some of the
prepared broth which he had given the male
that was on board, and which he did not ques-
tion would restore thtm graduallv.

I was not satisfied w ilh this, ' but, as I said
above, having a great mind to see the scene
of misery which I knew the ship itself would
present me with, in a more lively manner
than Iceuld have it by report, I took the cap-
tain of the ship, as we now called hitu, with
me, and went myself, a little ailer in their
boat.

Ifottnd the poor men on board almost in a
tumult, to get the vietuals out of the boiler
before it was ready: but my mate observed
his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-
room door ; and the man he placed there, after
using all possible persuasion to have patience,
kept them 011' hyforco: however, he caused
some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot,
and softened with the liquor of the meat,
which they called brewis, and gave them
every one some, to Stay their stomachs, and
told them it was for their own safety that he
was obliged to give them but little tit a time.
But it was all in vain; and had I not come
on board, and their own commander and olii-
cers with me, and with good words, and some
threats also of giving them no more, I he no
they would have broken into the cook-room by
force, and tom the meat out of the furnace;
for words are indeed of very small fume toe.
hungry belly however, we pacified them, and
fed them gryadually and cautiously fur the first,
and the next time gate them more, and at last
filled their bellies, and the men did well enough
But the miseryofthe poorpassengetsin
the cabin was of another nature, and far be-
yond the rest; {ores theship's company had
so little lbr themselves, it was but too true
that they had at first kept then: very low, and
at last totally neglected them; so that for six
or seven days it might be said they had really
no lbod at all, and for several days before very
little. The poor mother, who, as the men
reported, was a woman of sense and
breeding, had spared all she could so sfl'ee-
tionately for her son, that at last sho entirely
sunk under it: and when the mate of our ship
went itt, she set upon the flooror deck, with
her back up against the sides, between two
chairs. which were lashed fast, and her head
sunk between lter shoulders, like a corpse,
though not quite dead. My trute said all he
could to revive and encourage her, and with a
spoon put some broth into her mouth. She
opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but
could not speak; yet she understood what he
laid, and made signs to him, intimating that
it was too late for her, but pointed to her
child, as if she would have said they should
take care of him. However, the mate, who
was exceedingly moved with the sight, en-
deavoured to get someof the broth into her
mouth, and, as he said, got two or three
spoonfuls down; though I question whether
he could be sure of it or not: but it was too
late, and she died the same night.

The youth. who was preserved at the price
of his most affectionate mother's life. was not
so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin bed. as one
stretched out, with hardly any life left in him.
He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth,
having eaten up the rest of it: however, being
young, and having more strength than his
mather, the mate got something down his
throat. and he began sensibly to revive; though
by giving him, some time after, but two or
three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very
sick. and brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid: she
lay all along upon the deck, hard by her mis-
tress, and just likeone that had fallen down
with an apoplexy. and struggled for life. Her
limbs were distorted; one of her hands was
clasped round the frame of a chair, and she
griped it so hard, that we could not easily
make her let it go: be: other arm lay over
her head, and her feet lay both together, set
fut inst the frame of the cabin-table: in
short, she lay just like one in the agonies of
death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved
with hunger. and terrified with the thoughts

141

ofdeath, but, as the mentold us afterwards,
was broken-hearted for her minim, whom
she saw dying for Mom three days before,
and whom she loved most tenderly.

We knew notwhst to do with this poor girl;
litr when our surgeon, who was a man of very
great knowledge and experience, had, with
great application, recovered her as to life, he
had her upon his hands as to her senses; for
she was little less than distracted for a consi-
derable time alter, as shall appear presently.

Whoever shall reltl these memorandum
must be desired to consider, that visits at sea
are not lilte a journey into the country, where
sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at
a place: our business was, to reltevo this dis-
trmed ship's crew, but not lie by for them;
and though they were willing to steer the
same course with tn for some days, yet we
could no sail, to keep pace with a ship
that had no must: however, as their captain
begged ofus to help him to not up a main top-
most, and a ltind of a topmost to his jury firm-
mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three
or four days; and then having given him tire
barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogs-
hceds of biscuit, and a proportion of peas,
flour, and what other things we Could spare;
and tilting three cask! of sugar, some rum,
and some pieces of eight from them for srttis-
faction, we left them; taking on board with
us, at their own earnest request, the youth and
the maid, and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years
of age; a pretty, well bred, modest, and sensi-
ble youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his
mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father
but a few months befure, at Barbados: he
begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take
him out of the ship; for he said the cruel fel-
lows had murdered his mother: and, indeed,
so they had, that is to say. passively: for they
might have spared a small sustenance to the

helpless widow, that might have preserv-
ed her life, though it had been but just enough
to keep her alive: but hunger knows no friend,
no relation, no justice, no right; and then-fore
is remotseless. and capable of no commotion.

The surgeon told him how for we were
going, and that it would carry him away from
all his friends, and put him perhaps in as bad
cireutrutanees almost as those we found him
in. that is to say, starving in the world. He
said it mattered not whither he went, if he
was but delivered from the terrible crew that
ho was among; that the captain (by which he
meant me, for he could know nothing of my
nephew) had saved his life,and he was In.

We beetahout egreet while, end went
at drove on several islands in the tnooth
ot'thegreetrimOmnoce,hutmnet'er my
propose: onlythis! leernedhy my coasting
the shore, thet I was larder one great misleke
before, viz. that the continent which I thought
leew ion! the island! lived in, was really
no continent, but a long island, or rather a
ridge dielends, reechingfl'orn one to the other
side ot'the extended mouth ofthat great river;
and that the savages who came to my island
were not properly those which we call Carib-
hees, but islanders, end other barbarians of
the saute kind, who inhabited something
nearer to oursidethan the rest.

In short, I visited several of these islands
tono purpose; someI found were inhabited,
some were not: on one ofthem 1 bond
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived
there; but speaking with then, found they
hedesloopleyin a malicreek hard by, and
came thither to make salt and to catch some
pearl muscles, it'they wild; but the! they be-
longed to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay
farther north, in the latitude of ten and eleven
degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to another,
eotnetimes with the ship, sometimes with the
Frenchmen'e shallop, which we had found a
convenient host, and therefore kept her with
their very good will, at length I came fair on
the south side of my island, and presently
knew the very countenance of the place: so I
brought the ship safe to en andror, broadside
with thelittle creek where my old habitation
was.

Friday? how do yonknewthat'l Ono, Ono,
says Friday; he long ago die, long ago; be
much old man. Well, well, says I, Friday,
you don't know; but shall we see any one
else then? The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than I, and hepoints tothe hill just above
my old house; and though we lay half a league
off, he cries out, We see, we see, yes, yes,
we see much man there, and there, and there.
I looked, but I saw nobody, no, not with a
penpeetive glass, which was, I suppose, be-
cause I could not hit the place; for the fol.
.ow was right, as I found upon inquiry the
next day; and there were five or six men all
together who stood to look at the ship, not
snowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people,
I caused the English ancient to be spread,
and fired three guns, to give them notice we
were friends; and in about halt'a quarter of
an hour alter, we perceived a smoke arise
from the side of the creek; so I immediately
ordered the boat out, taking Friday with me;
and hanging out awhite flag, or a flag of truce,
I went directly on shore, taking with me the
young friar I motioned, to whom I had told
the stay of my living there, and the manner
of it, and every particular both of myselfand
these! let! there; and who was, on thatao-
count, extremely desirous to go with me. We
had besides about sixteen men well armed, if
we had bond any new guests there which we

whomIknewhyhisl'aoe perfeetiy we' - onto
his habit, I shall describe it allerwards t or-
dered nobody to go on shore at first but my-
self; but there N no keeping Friday in the
boat, for the affectionate creature had spied
his father at a distance, a good way otf the
Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of
him; and if they had not let him go ashore, he
would have jumped into the sea. He was no
sooner on shore, but he flew away to his
father, like an arrow out of a bow. It would
have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firrnest resolutiln, to have seen the first W
ports of this poor fellow's joy when he came
tohis father: how he embraced him, kissed
him,stroked his face, took him up in his arms,
set him down upon a tree, and lay down by
him; then stood and looked at him, a: any
one would look at a strange picture, for a quark
ter of an hour together; then lay down on the
ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him; one
would have thought the fellow bewitched.
But it would have made a dog laugh the next
day to see how his passion ran out another
way; in the morning he walked along the
shore, to and 'n, with his father several
hours, alwaysleading him by the hand, as if
he had been a lady; and every now and then
he would come to the boat to fetch something
or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a
dram, a hieeuiocake, or something or other
that was good. In the afternoon his frolies
ran another way; for then he would set the
old man down upon the ground and_ dance
about him, and make a thousand anttc poe-
tures and gestures; and all the while he did
this, he would be talking to him,and telling
him one story or other of his travels, and of
what had happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short. if the same filial afl'ection was
to be feund in Christians to their parents in
our part of the world, one would be tempted
to say, there would hardly have been any
need of the fifth commandment.

But this is a digression: I return to my
landing. it would be needles: to take notice
of all the ceremonies and civililies that the
Spaniards received me with. The lint Spa-
niard, Who. as I said. I knew very well, was
he whose life I had saved; he came towards
the boat, attended by one more, carrying a
flag uftruce also; and he not only did not
know me at first, but he had no thoughts. no
notion of its being me that was come, till I
spoke to him. Senhor, said I, in Portuguese,
doyou not know me? At which he spoke not
a word, but giving his musket to the titan that
was with him, threw his arms abroad. saying
something in Spanish that I did not [wrfectly
near, came forward and embraced me: telling
me he was inexcusable not to know that face
again, that he had once seen as it'an augt-l
from heaven sent to save his life: he said
abundance of very handsome thiugS, as a well
bred Spaniard always knows how; and then
beckoning to the person that attended hint,
bade hitugo and call out his comrades. He
then asked me if I would walk to ttty old ha-
bitation, where he would give me pnssoaiion
ofnty own house again, and tflterc i should see
they had made but mean improvements: so I
walked along with him: but alas'. ! could no
more find the place again than if i had never
been there: for they had planted so ntany
trees, and placed them in such a posture, so
thick and close to one another, and in ten
years' time they were grown so big, that, in
short, the place was inaccessible, except by
such windings and blind ways as they them-
selves only, wlto made them, could find.

I asked them what put them upon all these
fortifications: he told me! would say there
was need enough of it, when they had given
me an account how they had passed their
time since their arriving in the island, espe-
cially after they had the misfortune to find that
l was gone. He told me he could not but
have some satisfaction in my good fortune,
when he heard that! was gone in a good
ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had
oftentimes a strong persuasion that, one time
or other, he should see me again; but nothing

As to the three barbarians (so be uhed
them) that were Ml behind, and of whom. he
said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spa-
niards all thought themselvesmuch better among
the savages, only that their number was so
small: and, says he, had they been strong
enough, we had been all long ago in purga-
tory; and with that be erased himselfon the
breast. But, sir, says he, I hope you will not
be displeased when I shall tell youhow, forced
by necessity, we were obliged, for our own
preservation, to disarm them, and make them
oursuhjcets, who would not be content with
being moderately our masters, but would be
ottr murderers. I answered, I was heartily
afraid of it when I left them there, and no-
thingtroubled me at my parting from the island
but that they were not come back, that. I
might have put them in possession of every
thing first, and Mt the others in a state of
subjection, as they deserved; but if they had
reduced them to it, I was very g.ad, and
should be be very far fiom finding any fault
with it: ti).- 1 knew they were a parcel of re-
fractory, ungnvemetl villains, and were fit for
any manner of mischief.

White l was thus saying this, the mancame
whom he had sent back, and with him eleven
men more. In the dress they were in, it was
impossible to guess what nation they were of ;
but he made all clear, both to them and to me.
First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These. sir, are some of the gentlemen
who owe their lives to you; and then turning
to them, and pointing to me, he let them know
who I was; upon which they all came up, one
by one. not as if they had been sailors and or-
dinary fellows, and the like, but really as if
they had been arubassadors of nobleman, and
I a monarch or great conqueror: their behap
flour was to the last degree obliging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, ma-
jestic gravity, which very well become them;
and, in short, they had so much more manners
than I, that I scarce knew howto receive their
eivilities, much lea how to return them in
kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct
in, the island. tiller my going away, is Do very
remarkable, and has so many incidents, which
the former of my relation will help to un-
derstand, and which will, in most of the parti<
calm. refer to the amount I have alresd
given, that I cannot but commit them, wi
great delight, to the reading of those that come
after me.

Andliret, it isneceesary torepeat,thatI had
sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard
(the two whose lives I had rescued from the
ravages) in a large canoe, tothe resin, as I
then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's
companions that he lefl behind him, in order to
save them from the like calamity that he had
beenin,andin orderto succourthernfortbe

a very great ' to them, when they came
back, not only to find that I was gone, but to
find three strangers letl on tho spot,
ofall that I had left behind me, which would
otherwise have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired
into, that I might begin where 1 left of, was
oftheirown part; and I desired he would give
me a particular account of his voyage hack to
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him
to fetch them over. He told me there was
little variety in that part, for nothing remark-
able happened to them on the way, having had
very calm weather and a smooth sea. As hr
his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he
said, but that they were overjoyed to see him,
(iteeerns he was the principalmanunong
them, the captain of the vessel they had been
shipwrecked in havi been dead some time ;)
they were, he said, more surprised to nee
him, because they knew that he was fallen
into the hands of the savsges, who, they were
satisfied, would devour him, as they did all the
rest of their prisoners; that when he told them
the story of his deliverance, and in what man-
ner he was finished for carrying them away.

ment, he said, was somewhat like that of
Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he
was, and told them the story of his exalt-tier:
in Pharaoh's court ; but when beshowetl them
the anus, the powder, the hall, and provisions,
that he brought them for their journey or voy-
age, they were restoredto themselves, took a
just share of thejey of their deliverance, and
immediately prepared to come away with him.

Their first busine- was to get canoes: and
in this they were obliged not to stick so much
upon the honest part of it, but to trespass upon
their friendly savages, and to borrow two large
canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out
a fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came
away the next morning. It seems they want-
ed no time to get themselves ready; fin they
hid no baggage, neither clothes nor provisions,
nor any thing in the world but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they
used to make their bread.

They were in all three weelts about; and
in that time, mlucltily for them, I had the oc~
mien ofl'ered for my escape, as I mentioned
in my other part, and to get ofl't'roat the island,
leaving three of the moat imputlt-nt, hardened,
ungovemed, disagreeable villains behind me,
that any man could desire to meet with: to
the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappoin-
ment, you may be sure. .

The only jtnt thing the rogues did was,
that when the Spaniards came ashore, they
gave my letter to.them, and gave them prou-
sions. and other relief, as I had ordered them
todo; also Iheygavethem the long paper of
directions which I had ten with them, can

grapes, made my pots,'and, in a word, every
thing I did; all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, (two of them unden-
etood English well enough :) nor did they re-
fuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any
thing else, for they agreed very well for some
time. They gave them an equal admission
into the home, or cave, and they began to live
very sociahly; and the head Spaniard, who
had seen pretty much of my methods, and
Friday's father together, all their
afl'airs: but as tor the Englishmen, they did
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot
parrots, and catch tortoises: and when they
oamehome atr night, the Spamsn'll' prouded
their suppers or them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied

with this,bsdtheothenhutlet theInalane;
which= however, they could not find in their
hearts to do long, but, like the dog in the man-
ger, they wottld not eat themselves, neither
woutdt'rtoy tetthe others eat. Tlteditl'erenceo,
nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and uneh
u are not worth relating, but at last it broke
out inn-open war: and it began with all the
rudeness and insolt'nce that can be imagined,
without reason, without provocation, contrary
to ttatttre,and, indeed, to commonsense: and
though. it is true, the first relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whomI may
call the acmsets, yet when I came to exa-
mine the fellows, they could not deny a word
ot~ it.

But before I come to the particulars of this
part, I mttst supply a defect in my former rela-
tion; and this am, I forgot to set down,
among the rest, that. just as we were weighing
the anchor to set sail, there happened a little
quarrel on board of our ship, which I was once
afraid would have turned to a second mutiny;
nor was it. appeased till the captain, rousing
up his courage, and taking us all to his assist-
anne, parted them by force, and making two
of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he
laid them in irons; and as they had been active
in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly,
dangerous words, the second time he threat-
ened to carry them in iron: to England, and
have them hanged there for mutiny, and run-
ning away with the ship. This, it seems, though
the captain did not intend to do it, frightened
some other men in the ship; and some of
them had put it into the heads of the rest that
the captain only gave them good words for the
present, till they should come to some English
port, and that then they should be all put into
gaol. and tried the their lives. The mate got.
intelligence ofthis, and acquainted us with it ;
upon which it was desired that I, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and
tell them that they might be assured, if they
behaved ,well the rest of the voyage, all they
had done for the time past should be pardoned.
So I went, and after passing my honour's word
to them, they appeared easy, and the more so
when I caused the twa menthat were in iron:
to be released and forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor
for that night; the wind also falling calm next.
morning, we found that our two men who had
been laid in irons had stole each of them a
whet, andm other weapons, (what powder

or shot they had we knew not,) and had taken
the ship's pinnnoe, which was not yet haled
up, and runaway with her to their companions
in roguery on shore. As soon as we found
this, I ordered the longboat on shore, with
twelve men and the mate, and away they went
to seek the rogues ; but they could neither find
them or any of the rest, for they all tied into
the woods when they saw the boat coming on
shore. The male was once resolved, in justice
to their roguory, ttfhave destroyed their plarb
tations, burned all their scholdstutr and
furniture, and left them to shift without it; but
having no orders, he let it all alone, left every
thing as he lbund it, and bringing the pinnaco
away, came on board without them. These
two men made their number live; but the
other three villains were so much more wicked
than they, that afler they had been two or
three days together, they turned the two new
comers out of doors to shift ibr themselves, and
would have nothing to do with them; nor could
they, for a good while, be persuaded to give
them any food: as for the Spaniards, they
were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore,
the business began to go fitrward : the Spaniards
would have persuaded the three English brutes
to have taken in their two countrymen again,
that, as they said, they might be all one fa-
mily; but they would not hear of it: so the
two poor fellows lived by themselves; and
finding nothing but industry and application
would make them live comfortably, they pitch-
ed their tents on the north shore of the island.
but a little more to the west, to be out of dan-
ger of the savages, who always landed on the
out parts of the island.

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge
in, and the other to lay up their magazines
and stm in; and the Spaniartk having given
them some corn for seed, and especially some
of the peas which I had left them, they dug,
planted. and enclosed, after the pattern I had
set for them all. and began to live pretty well.
Their first crop of com wason the ground;
and though it was but a little bit of land which
they had dug up at first, having had but a little
time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and
find them with bread and other eatables; and
one of the fellows, being the cook'-stnate of the
ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings,
and such other preparations as the rice and th
milk, and such little flesh as they got, fur~
nished him to do.

posture, when the three unnatural rogues,
their own countrymen too, in mere humour,
and to insult them, came and bullied them,
and told them the island was theirs- that the
goVemor, meaning me, had given ihem the
possession of it, and nobody eltie had any
right to it; and that' they should build no
houses upon their ground, unless they would
pay rent for them.
. The two men, thinking they were jeating
at first, asked them to come in and sit down,
and see what fine houses they were that they
had built, and to tell them what rent they de-
manded; and onset them merrily said, if they
were the ground landlords, he hoped, if they
built tenements upon their land, and made
improvements, they would, according to the
custom of landlords, grant along lease: and
desired they would geta eon-inner to draw the
writings. One of the three, cursing and re.-
ging, told them they should see they were not
in jest; andgoingte alittlu plane at e dis-

that not without some difficulty too.

The fellowwaa in such a rage at the honest
man's thrusting him away, that he rammed

and had not the man avoided the blow very
nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his

immediately they came both out with their
musketa; and the man that was first struck at

'with the pole, knocked the fellow down that

had begun the quarrel with the stock of his
musket, and that before the other two could
come to help him; and then seeing the rest
come at them, they stood together, and pre-
senting the other end: of their pieces to them,
bade them stand off.

. The others had firearms with them too;
but one of the two honest men, bolder than
his comrade, and made desperate by his dan-
ger, told them, if they ofl'ered to move hand or
foot'they were dead men, and boldly oom-

'manded them to lay down their arms. They

did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but
seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a'
parley, and they cemented to take their
wounded manwith themand be gone; and,
indeed, it seemsthe fellow waswotmded tuf-
ficiently with the blow. However, they were
touch in the since they had thead-
vantnge, that they did not disarm them afoo-
otnlly, as they might have done, and have
gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given
them on account how the rogue! had treated
them; for the three villains etttdied nothing
butt-avenge, and every day gave them some
intimation that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account
of the lesser part of the roguerlee, such as
trending down their corn; shooting three
young kidsandaahe-goat,whichthe poormen
hndgottobreed uptatne firtheirstore: and,
in a word, plaguing them night and day in
this manner; it forced the two men to auch a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them
all three, tlte first time they had a [air oppor-
tunity. In order to this, they resolved to go
to the castle. as they called it, (that was, my
old dwelling.) where the three rogues end the
Spaniards ell lived together at that time, in-
tending to have a fair battle, and the Spap
niards Should stand by, to unfair play : so they
got up in the morning before day. and came to
the place. and called the Englishmen by their
names, telling a Spaniard that amerod that
they wanted to speak with them.

It happened that the day before, twoot'the
Spaniards having been in the woods, had not:
one of the two Englishmen, whom, for die-
tinction, I called the honest men, and he had
made a tad complaint to the Spaniards ot' the
barbarous usage they had met with from their

they had laboured so hard to bring forward,
and killed the milch-goat and their three kids,

they called Will Atkins, Come.Jac|t, let's go,

Upon this they went all trooping away,
with every men a gun, e pistol, and a sword,
and muttered some ineolent things among
themselves, of what they would do to the
Spaniards too, when opportunity otl'ered: but
the Spaniards, it seems, did not aoperfeetly
understand thornas to know all the particulars,
only that, in general, they threatened them
hard for taking the two Englishmen'e part.

it happened, and very luckily for them all,
that they were up, and gone abroad before the
bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.

When they came there, and found the men
gone, Atkins, who, it seems, was the thr-
wardeet man, called out to his comrade, Ha,
Jack, here's'the mm, butd--n them, the birds
are flown. They mused awhile, to think
what should be tho occasion of their being
gone abroadeo soon, and suggested presently
that the Spaniards had given them notice of
it: and with that they shook hands, and
swore to one another that they would be re-
venged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had
made this bloody bargain, they tell tovworlt
with the poor man's habitation ; they did not
set fire indeed, to any thing, but they pulled
down both their houses and pulled them so
'limb from limb, that t ey let! not the least
stick standing, or scarce any sign on the

where they stood: they tore all their
little collected householdatuii' in pieces, and
threw every thing about in such a manner,
that the men atterwards found some of
their things amileofl' their habitation. When
they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted;
pulled up an enclosure they had made to se-
cure their cattle and their corn; and, in a
word, sacked and plundered every thing as
completely as a horde of Tartare would have
done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone
to find them out, and had resolved to fight
them wherever they had been, though they
were but two to three; so that, had they met,
there certainly would have been bloodshed
among them; for they were all very stout,
resolute fellows, to give them their due.

But Providence took more care to keep
them asunder than they themselves could do
to meet; for, as if they had dogged one ano-
ther, when the three were gone thither, the
two were here; and allerwards, when the
two went back to find them, the three were
come to the old habitation again: weshallsee
their different conduct presently. When the
three carnebaeklike furious creatures, flushed
with the rage which the work they had been
about had put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done,
by wayot'ecoffand bravado; and one of
them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as
if they had been a couple of boys at play,
takes hold ofhis hat as it was upon his head,
and giving it a twirl about, flooring in his face,
lays to him, And you, Senhor Jack Spa-
aiard, shall have the same sauce, if you do not

mend your manners. The Spaniard, who,
though a quiet-civil man, was as brave a man
as could be, and withal a strong, well-made
'rn'an, looked at him for a good while, and then,
having no weapon in his hand, stepped grave.
ly upto him, and with one blow of his fist
knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a
pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, as in-
solent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spa-
niard immediately: he missed his body, indeed,
for the bullets went through his hair, but one
of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard
believe he was more hurt than he really was,
and that put him into some heat, [or before he
acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolving
to go through with his work, he stooped, and
took the felluw's musket whom he had knocked
down, and was just going to shoot the men
who had fired at him, when the rest of the
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and
calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in,
secured the other two, and took their am
from them.

When they were thus disarmcd, and found
they had made all the Spaniards their enemies,
as well as their own countrymen, they began
to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better
words, would have their anns again ; but the
Spaniards, considering the feud that was be-
tween lhcm and the other two Englishmen,
and that it would be the best method they
could take to keep them from killing one ano-
ther, told them they would do them no harm,
and if they would live peaceably, they would
be very willing to assist and associate with
them as they did below; but that they could
not think of giving them their arms again,
while they appeared so resolved to do mis-
chief with them to their own countrymen, and
had even threatened them all to make them
their servants.

The rogues were now no more capable to
hear reason than to act with reason; but
being refused their arms, they went raving
away, and raging like madmen, threatening
what they would do, though they had no fire-
arm. But the Spaniards, despising their
threatening, told them they should take care
how they ofl'ered any injury to their plantation
or cattle, for it' they did, they would shoot
them as they would ravenous beasts, when-
ever they found them; and if they fell into
their hands alive they should certainly be
hanged. However, this was far from cooling
them, but away they went, raging and wear-
ing like furies of hell. As soon as they were
gone. the two men came back, in passion and50 , ADVENTURES or n
rage enough also, though of another kind; for
having been at their plantation, and finding it
all demolished and destroyed, as above, it
will easilybe supmed they had provocation
enou . They could scarce have room to
tell eir tale, the Spaniards were so eager to
tell them theirs; and it was strange enough to
find that three men should thus bully nineteen,
and receive no ptmishment at all.

' The Spaniards, indeed, despised them,
and especially, having thus disarraed them,
made light of their threatnings; but the two
Englishmen resolved to have their remedy
against them, what pains soevcr it cost to
find them out. But the Spaniards interposed
here too, and told them, that as they had dis-
armed them, they could not consent that they
(the two) should pursue them with firearnis,--
and perhaps kill them. But, said the grave
Spaniard, whowas theirgovernor, we will en-
deavour to make them do you justice, if you will
leave it to us: for there isnodoubt but they
will come to us again, when their passion is
over, being not able to subsist without our as-
sistance: we promise you to make no peace
with them, without having a full satisfaction
for you; and upon this condition we hope you
will promise to use no violence with them,
other than in your own defence. The two
Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards
protwed, that they did it only to keep them-
fiom bloodshed, and to make all easy at last.
For, said they, we are not so many of us;
here is room enough for us a'l, and it is a
great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent. and waited for
the issue of the thing, living .'tr some days
with the Spaniards; for their own habitation
was destroyed.

In about five days' time the three vagrants,
tired with wandering, and almost starved with
hunger, having chiefly lived on turtlc's eggs
all that while, came back to the grove; and
finding my Spaniard, who,as lhave said, was
the governor, and two more with him walking
by the side of the creek, they came up in a
very submissive humble manner, and begged
to be received again into the family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them
they had acted so unnaturnlly by their coun-
trymen, and so very gromly by them, (the
Spaniards.) that they could not come to any
conclusion without consulting the two Eng-
lishmen and the rest; but, however, they
would go to them, and discourse about it, and
they should know in half an hour. It may be
gamed that they were very hard put toit:

caisson causoa.

for, it seems, asthey were to wait this half
hour for an answer, they begged they would
send them out some bread in the mean time,
which they did; sending, at the same time,
a large piece of goat's flesh, and is boiled
parrot, which they ate very heartily, for they
were hungry enough. '

After half an hour's consultation, they were
called in, and a long debate ensued; their
two countrymen charging them with the ruin
of all their labour, and adesign to murder
them; all which they owned before, and
therefore could not deny now. Upon the
whole, the Spaniards acted the moderator
between them; and as they had obliged the
two Englishmen not to hurt the three
while they were naked and unarmed, so they

  

now obliged th 'ee to go and rebuild their
fellows' two h ' be of the same, and
the other of large; (I ' 6", than they were

before; to fence their '_ again where
they had pulled up their fencesyplant trees in
the room of those pulled up, dig up the land
again for lanting corn where they had spoiled,
it, and, ' a word, to remore every thing in
the state as they (hand it, as near as
they id; for entirely it could not be, the
ac hr the corn, and.the growth of the trees
and hedges, not being possible to be re-
covered.

Well, they submitted to all this; and as
they had plenty of provisions given them all
the while, they grew very orderly, and the
whole society beganto live pleasantly and
agreeably together again; only, that these
three fellows could never be persuaded to
work,l mean for themselves, except now and
then a little, just as they pleased: however,
the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they
would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the of the whole plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and'
let them walk about and be as idle as they
pleased: and thus having lived pretty well
together for a month or two, the Spaniards
gave them arms again, and gave them liberty
to go abroad with them as before.

It was not above a week tiller they had
these arms, and went abroad, but the un-
grateful crcatures began to be as insolent
and troublesome as before: but, however, an
accident happened presently upon this, which
endangered the safety of them all; and they
were obliged to lay by all private reeentments,
and look to the preservation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spanish
governor, as I call him, that is to say, the
[Spaniard whose lite 1 had saved, who was
now the captain, or leader, or governor of the
rest, found himself very uneasy in the.nigbt,
and could by no means get any sleep; he was
perfectly well inbody, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind
ran upon men lighting and killing ofond ano-
ther, but he was broad awake, andcould not
by any means get any sleep; in short, he lay
a great while; but growing more and more
and more uneasy, be resolved to rise. As
they lay, being so many of them, upon goat's
skins laid thick upon such couches and pads
as they made lbr themselves and not in barn-
moclts and ship beds, as I did, who' was but
one, so they had little to do, when they were
willing to rise, but to get up upon their feet,
and perhaps put on acost,suchas it was, and
their pumps, and they were ready for going
any way that their "fights guided them.
Being thus got up,he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing; and, be-
sides, the trees which I had planted, as in my
former account is described, and which were
now'grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that
he could only look up, and see that it was a
clear starlight night, and hearing no noise,
he retumed and laid him down again: but it
was all one; he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to any thing like rest; but
his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy,
and he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and
walking about, going out and coming in, ano-
ther of them waited. and calling, asked who
it' was that was up. The governor told him
how it had been with him. Say youso'! says
the other Spaniard; smh things are not to be
slighted, I assure you: there is certainly some
mischief working near us: and presently he
asked him, Where are the Englishmen?--
They are all in their huts, says be, safe enough.
It seems the Spaniards had kept pomssion
of the min a ent, and.had made a place
for the three Englishmen, who, since their
last mutiny, were always quartered by them-
selves, and could not come at the rest. Well,
says the Spaniard, there is something in it, I
am persuaded, from my own exponence.

verse with, and receive intelligence from, the
spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the invi-
sible world; and this fi'iendly notice is given
for our advantage, if we knew how to make
use of it. Come, says he, lotus go and look
abroad; andifvre find nothing stall initto

In a word,they wentout, togo up to the
top of the hill, where I used to go: but they
being strong, and a good company, not alone,
as I was, used none of my cautions, to go up
by the ladder, and pulling it up alter them, to
go up a second stage to the top, but were
going round Mugh the grove, unconcerned
and unwary, when they were surprised with
seeing a light as of lire, a very little way otf
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not
of one or two, but of a number.

In allthe discoveries I had made of the
savages landin on the island, it was my con-
stant care to vent them making the least
discovery of there being any inhabitant upon
the place; and when by any occasion they
came to know it, they felt it so efi'octually,
that they that got away were scarce able to
give any account of it; for we disappeared as
soon as possible; nor did ever any that had
seen me mape to tell any one else, except it
was the three savages in our last encounter,
who jumped into the boat; of whom, I mon-
tioned, I was afraid they would go home and
bring more help. Whether it was the con-
sequence of the escape of these men that so
great a number came now together, or who-
ther they came ignorantly, and by accident, on
their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could
not, it seems, understand; but, whatever it
was, it had been their business either to
have concealed themselves, or not to have
seen them at all, much less to have let the sa>>
vages have seen that there were any inhabi-
tants in the place; or to have fallen upon them
so efi'ectually, as that 'not a man of them
should have escaped, which could only have
been by getting in between them and their
boats: but this presence of mind was wanting
to them, which was the ruin of their tran-
quility for a. great while.

We need not doubt, but that the governor
and the manwith him, surprised with this sight,
ran back-immediately, and raised their fellows,
giving them an account of the imminent dan-
ger they were all in, and they again as readily
took the alarm; but it was impossible to per-
suade them to stay close within, where they
were, but tbeymust all run out to seehow

While it was dark, indeed, they were well
enough, and theyhad opporumity enough, for
some hours, to view them by the light of three
fires they had made ate, distancefrorn one ano-
ther; what they were doing they knew not, and
what to do themselves they knew not. For,
first, the enemy were too many; and, secondly,
they did not keep together, but were divided152., 5'"

into several puties, and where on shore in
several places. -
The Spaniards were in no small conster-
nation at this sight; and as they found that
the fellows ran straggling all over the shore,
they made no doubt but, first or lost, some of
them would chop in upon ah habitation, or
upon some other place where they would see
the token of inhabitants; and they were in
great perplexity also for fear of their flock of
goats, which would have been little less than
starving them, if they should have been de-
stroyed; so the first thing th ed upon
was, to deepatch three men before it was

not be seen; he told them their safety corr-
sisted in it, and that they had nothing to do
but lie still, andthe savages would kill one
another to their hands, and then the rest
would go away; and it was so to a little.
But it was impossible to prevail, especially
uponthe Englishmen; their curiosity was so
importunnte upon their prudentials, that they
must run out and see the battle: however, they
used some caution too, viz. they did not go
openly just by theirewn dwelling, but went far-
ther into the woods, and placed themselves to
adhantage, where they might securely see them
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be

light, two Spaniards andone Englishman, token by them; but it seems the savages did

drive all the goats away'to the great vallfiy
where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive
them into the very cave itself. Could they
have seen the savages all together in one body,
and at a distance from their canoes, they re~
solved, if there had been ahundred of them,
to have attacked them; but that could not be
obtained; for they were some of them two
miles ofl'from the other; and, as it appeared
afterwards, were of two difl'erent nations.
After having mused a great while on the
course they should take, and beating their
brains in considering their present circum-
stances, they resolved, at last, while it was
still darlr, to send the old savage, Friday's
father, out as a spy, to learn, if possi e, some-
thing conceming them ; as what they came tbr,
what they intended to do, and the like. The
old men readily undertook it; and stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the savages
were, away he went. Alter he had been gone
an hour or two, he brings word that he had
been among them undiscovered; that he found
they were two parties, and of two several na-
tions, who had war with one another, and had
a great battle in their own country: and that
both sides having had several prisoners taken
in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed
allou the some island, for the devouring their
prrsoners and making many, but their comi
so by chance to the same place had spoiled al
their mirth : that they were in a great rage at
one another, and were so near, that he be-
lieved they would fight again as soon as day-
light began to appear: but he did not perceive
that they had any notion of any body being on

the island but themselves. He had hardly ,

made an end oftelling his story, when they
could perceive, by the unusual noise they made,
that the two little armies were engaged in .
bloody tight.

Friday's {other used all the eats b0
enuldtoperauadeourpeople tolieclose and

see them, as we 'shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce ; and, if I might
believe the Englishmen, one of them said he
could perceive that s'ome of them were men
of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of
great policy in guiding the fight. The battle,
they said, held two hours before they could
guess which party would be beaten; but then,
that party which was nearest our people's ha-
bitation began to appear weakest, and, alter
some time more, some of them began to fly;
and this put our men again into a great con-
sternation, lest any one of those that fled should
run into the ve before their dwelling for
shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the
place; and that, by consequence, the pur-
suers would do the like in search of them.
Upon this they resolved that they would stand
hrmed within the wall, and whoever came into
the grove, they resolved to sally out over the
wall and kill them: so that, if possible, not
one should return to give an account of it:
they ordered also that it should be done with
their swords, or by knocking them down with
the stocks of their muskets, but not by shoot-
ing them, for fear of raising an alarm by the
MISC.

As they ed, it fell out: three of the
routed army fled for life, and crossing the
creek, ran directly into the place, not in the
least knowing whither they went, but running
as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout
they kept to look abroad gave notice of this
within, with this addition, to our men's great
satisfaction, viz. that the conquerors had not
pursued them, or seen which way they were
gone; upon this, the Spaniard governor, a man
of humantty, would not suffer them to kill the
three fugitives, but sending three men out by
the top of the hill, ordered them to go round,
come inbehind them, and surprbe and take
them prisoners, which was done. The residue
of the conquered people fled to their canoes.
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

and got off to sea; the victors retired, made
no pursuit, or very little, but drawing them-
selves into a body together, gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed was
by way of triumph, and so the ht ended:
and the same day, about three o'cock in the
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes.
And thus the Spaniards had their island again
freetothemselves, their fright was over, and
they saw no savages in several years ntler.

Alter they were all gone, the Spaniards
came out of their den, and viewing the field of
battle, they found about tthlnd-thirty men
dead on the spot: some were killed with great
long arrows, some of which were found stick-
ing in their bodies; but most of them were
killed with great wooden swords, sixteen or
seventeen of which they found in the field of
battle, and as many bows, with a great many
arrows. These swords were strange, great,
unwieldy things, and they must be very strong
men that used them: most of those men that
were killed with them had their heads meshed
to pieces, aswe may say, or, us we call it
in English, their brains knocked out, and se-
veral their arms and legs broken; so that it is
evident they fight with itiexpressible rage and
fury. We found not one man that was not
stone--dead, for either they stay by their
enemy till they have quite killed him, or they
carry all the wounded men that are not quite
dead away with him.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen
for a great while; the sight had filled them
with horror, and the consequences appeared
terrible to the last degree, especially upon
supposing that some time or other they should
fall into the hands of those matures, who
would not only kill them as enemies, but kill
them for food, as we kill our cattle; and they
professed to me, that the thoughts, of being
eaten uplikebeefor mutton, though itwas sup-
posed it was not to be till they were dead, had
lomethingin it so horrible, that it nauseated
their very stomachs,made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with such
unusual terror, that they were not themselves for
some weeks after. This,as Iseid, mmedeven
the three English brutes I have been speaking
of. and, fora great while afier, they were tract-
able, and wentabout the common business of
the whole society well enough; planted,
sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised
to the counu'y But some time after this,
they fell into such simple measures again, as
brought them into agreat dealot' trouble.

They hadtaken three prisoners, as I ob-
served; and these three being lusty. stout

153

young fellows, they made them servants, and
taught them to work for them; and, as slaves,
they did well enough; but they did not take
their measures with them as [did by my man
Friday, viz. to begin with them upon the
principle of ha 'ngsaved their lives, and then
instruct them the rational principles of life;
much less of religion, civilizing, and reducing
them by kind usage and afl'ectionate arguinga;
but as they gave them their food every day, so
they gave them their work too, and kept them
fully employed in drudgery enough; but they
failed in this it, that they never had them
to assist them, and fight for them, as I had my
man Friday, <<he was as true to me as the
very flesh upon my'bones. '

But to come to the family part. Being all
now good friends, for common danger, as I
said above, had effectually reconciled them,
they began to consider their general circum-
stances; and the first thing that came under
their consideration was, whether, seeing the
savages particularly haunted that side of the
island, and that there were more remote and
retiwd parts of it equally adapted to their way
of living, and manifestly to their advantage,
they should not rather move their habitation,
and plant in some more proper place for their
safety, and especially for the security of their
cattle and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was con-
cluded that they would not remove their ha-
bitation; because that, some :'rm 0;; other,
the thought the m' ht hear min t eir go-
vezor again, m'eanifig me; and if I should
send any one to seek them, I should be sure
to direct them to that side , where, if they
should find the place demolished, they would
conclude the savages had killed us all, and we
were gone; and so our supply would go too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed
to remove them into the valley where my cave
was, where the land was as proper for both,
Id where, indeed, there was land enough:
however, upon second thoughts, they altered
one part of their resolution too, and resolved
onlyto remove part of their cattle thither, and
plant partof their corn there; and eoif one part
was destroyed, the other might be saved.
And one part ol'prudenco they used, which it
was very well they did, viz. that they never
trusted those three savages, which they had
prisoners, with knowing any thing of the plan-
tation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there, much less of the cave
there, which they kept, in case of necessity
as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also
the two barrels of powder which I had sent
then at my coming away. But, however they
resolved not to change their habitation; yet
they agreed, that as I had carefully covered
it that with a wall or fortification. and then
with a grove oftreea, so acoing their aafety
consintcd entirely in their boin concealed, of
which they were now fully eon cod, they let
to work to cover and conceal the place yet
more effectually than hem. For this pith
lulst', u I planted trees, or rather thrust in
makes, which in time all grew up to bu trees,
thr tttmlc good distance before the entrance into
my altltnmentn, they We!" on in the name man-
ner, and filled up the ml of that whole space
of grmtml. from the tree: I had lt'l, quite down
to tltt' side of the creek. where, as 1 said, I
landed my floats, and even into the very ooze
where the tidn flowotl, not so much a! leaving
any place to land, or any nign that there had
been any landing then-about; these stake:
also bring of a Wood very forward to grow. as
I have noted formerly, they took care to have
them generally much larger and taller than
thou: whinhl had planted; and am they grow
attach, so they planted them so very thick and
claw together, tltat when they had ht-t-rt three
or four years grown, there was no piercing
with tltc t'yu any considerable way into the
plantation: and, as fitr that part which I had
plantml. the trees were grown as think at a
matt'l thigh, and among them they planted so
many other Ihort ones, and so thick, that, in a
word, it stood like a palliaatlo a quarter of a
mile thick, and it was next to impossible to
pent-tram it, httt with a little army to cut it all
down; for a little dog could hardly get between
the trees, tltey stood so close.

But this was not all; for they did the name
by all the ground to tho right hand and to the
left, and round even to the top of the hill,
leaving no way, not to much u for thonwelvoa
to come om, but by the ladder placed up to
the side oflho hill. and then lifted up, and
placed again from the tint stage up to the top;
and when the ladder was taken down, nothing
but what had wings, or witchcraft to assist it,
could come at them. Thia was excellently
wcll contrived; nor was it lost: than what they
'allcrwanla found occasion for; which served
to convince me, that as human prudence haa
the authority of Providence to jtmil'y it, no it
has doubtless tho direction ofProvidenco to not
it to work; and if we listened carefully to the
voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent
many of the disaster: which our lives are now,
by our own negligence, aubjocted to: but this
by the way. .

after this in perfect retirement, and had no more
viaita from the aavagea. They had indeed an
alarm given them one morning, which put
them into a great consternation; for some of
the Spaniards being out early one morning on
the "lot! ride, of rather end, of the inland,
(which was that end where I never wentJbt'
four ofbcing dimvcrod,) they worn surprised
with aeeing above twenty canon of lndians

just eorningon shore. They made the best

of their way home, in hurry enough; and
giving the alarm to their comrades, tltt-y kt-pt
cloao all that day and the next, going out
only at night to nuke their observation: but
they had the good look to be mistaken; for
wherever tho Sarge: wont, they did not land
that time on the island, but pursued some
other design.

And now they had another broil with the
three Englishmen; one of whom a most turbu-
lent fellow, being in arage at onn ot'tlte three
llavmt, which I mentioned they had taken,
Incense the fellow had not done mmelhing
right which he hid him do, and seemed a liltlo
tuttraotnble in his showing him, drew a hatch-
ot out ofa frag-hull, in which he wore it by his
aide, and full upm the poor savage, not to
com-ct him, but to kill him. One nftho Spa-
niards, who was by, seeing him give the fol-
low a barbarous cut with the lttttcllt'l, which
he aimed at his head, but atmch into his shoul-
dent. no that he thought he had cut the poor
creature's arm ofl'. ran to him, and etttreating
him not to murder the poor man, placed him-
at-ll'betm-en him and the savage, to prevent
the mischief. The follow being enraged the
more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his
hatchet, and aware ha wouhl aervo him as he
intended to nerve the savage; which the Spa-
niard tmrcteiving, avoided the blow, and with
arhuvolwhich he had in hiahund, (for they
were all working in the field about their corn-
land.) knocked tho brute down. Anothcrof
the Engliahnwn running at the same time to
help his comrado. knocked the Spaniard down;
and then two Spaniards more earm- in to help
their man. and a third Englithen fell in upon
them. They had none of them any firearms,
or any other weapons but hatchet: and other
toola, except thin third Engliohmcn: he had
one of my rusty cutlaam, with which he
made at the two last Spaniards. and wounded
them both. This fray lot the whole family in
an uproar, and more help coming in, they
took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next atinn was, what ahould be dine with
them They had been so oflen rnutinoua,
and were ao very thrioua, so desperate, and lo
idle withal, they knew not what cots-e to
take with them, [hr they were mischievous
to the highest degree,and valued not what
hunthey didto onymsn; sothat, inshort.it
was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was told them,
insomany words, thatit'theyhad heenol'his
own country, he would have hanged them;
for all laws and all governors were to preserve
society, and those who were dangerous to the
society ought to be expelled out of it; but as
they were Englishmen, and that it was to the

kindness of an Englishman that they
all owad their preservation and deliverance,
he would use themwith all possible lonity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englishmen, who were their coun-
trymcn.

Ono oriha two hottest Englishmen mod up,
and said they desired it might not be. let! to
them: For, says he, I aIn sure we ought to
sentence them to the gallows: and with that
he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of
tho three, had to have all the five
Englishmen join together, and murder all the
Spnninnla when they were in their sleep.

When the Spsnish governor heard this, he
calls to "fill Atkins, How, Senhor Atkins,
would you murderosall? Whathavo you to
shy to that? The hardened villain was so far
from denying it, that he said it was true: and,
G--d H him, they would do it etill, before
they had done with them. Well, but Sonhor

to you, that you will kill us? And what
would you get by killing us? And whst must

the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Sen-
hor Atkins was inwh a rage atthe Spanierd's
making ajestol'it,that,hedhe notheen held

him, it was thought he would have attempted
to have ltilled the Spaniard in the middle of all
the company. This hairhrain carriage obliged
them to comider seriously what was to be
done: the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard
who saved the poor savage, were of the opinion
thatthcyshould hang oneot'tluee, for an ex-
ample to the rest; and that particularly it
should he he that had twice attempted to com-
mit murder with his hatchet; and, indeed,
there was some reason to believe he had done
it, for the r savage was in such a misera-
hle condition with the wound he had received,
that it was thoughthe could notlive. But
the governerSpaoiard-tillsaid no; itwssan

todeath, though hehad murdered hall'otrhern;
nay,hesaid, he had boenkilled himself by

This was so positively insisted on by the
governor Spaniard, that there was no gainsay-
Ingit; and as merciful ootmsels are most apt
toprevail, where lboyansoearnestly pressed,
sotheyallcameinto it; butthen itwastobe
comideted what should he done to keep them
from doing the misdtiel' they designed; for all
agreed, governor and all, that means were to
be used for preserving the society from danger.
Afler a long debate, it was ageoed, first, that
they should be diesrrned, and not permitted to
have either gun, pwder, shot, sword, or any
weapon; and should be usrnedotuol'the so
ciety, and left to live where they would, and
how they would, by themselves: but that none
oftho rest, either SpanisrdsorEnglish, should
convene with them, spoalt with thorn, or have
any thing to do with them: that they should
he forbid to come within a certain distance of
the place where the rest dwelt; and if they
ofl'crod to commit any disorder, so as to spoil,
burn, lrill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society, they should die without mercy, and
they would shoot them wherever they could
find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity,
musing upon the sentence, considered a little
upon it; and turning to the two honest Eng-
lishmen, said, Hold; you must rolled. that it
willhe longere theycan ra'ue corn and cattle
of their own, and they must not starve; we
must therefore allow them isiorts: so he

went away sullen and refractory, as neither
content logo awsynortostay; hut,asthere
was no remedy, theywent, pretendingtog
and choose a place where they would settle
themselves: and some provision were given
them, but no weapons.

About four or live days alter, they came
again for some victuals, and gave the governor
an account where they had pitched their tents,
and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation; and it was a very convenient place,
indeed, on the remtest part of the island, N.
E. much about the place where I providentially
landed in my first voyage, when I was driven
out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in
my foolish attempt to sail round the island.

Here they built themselves two handsome
huts, and contrived them in a manner like my
first habitation, being close under the side of a
hill, having some trees growing already on
three sides of it, so that byplaming others, it
would be very easily covered from the sight,
unless narrowly searched for. They desired
some dried goats'-skins, for beds and covering,
which were given them; and upon giving their
words that they would not disturb the rest, or
injure any of their plantations, they gave them
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare;
some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing; and,
in a word, any thing they wanted, except arms
and ammunition. -

They lived in this separate condition about
six months, and had got in their first harvest,
though the quantity was but small, the parcel
of land they had planted being but little; for,

indeed, having all their plantation to form, '

they had a great deal of work upon their hands;
and when they came to make boards and pots,
and such things, they were quite out of their
element, and could make nothing of it: and
when the rainy season came on, for want of a
cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoil-
ing; and this humbled them much: so they
came and god the Spaniards to help them,

thingsfrom the rain; but it wasbnt apoor place
at best, compared to mine, and especially as
mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly
enlarged it, and made several new apartments
in it.

- About three quarters ofa year allor this so-
paration, a new frolic took these rogues, which,
together with the former villany they had com-
mitted, brought mischief enough upon them,
and had very near been the ruin of the whole
colony; The three new associates began, it
seems, to be weary of the laborious life they
led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim took them, that
they would made a voyage to the continent,
fi'om whence the savages came, and would try
if they could seize upon some prisoners among
the natives there. and bring them home, so to
make them do the laborious part of their work
for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they
had gone no farther: but they did nothing, and
proposed nothing, but had either mischief in
the design, or mischief in the event: and, if
I may give my opinion, they seemed to be
under a blast from Heaven; for if we will not
allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes,
how shall we reconcile the events of things
with the divine justice? It was certainly an
apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny
and piracy that t them to the state they
were in ; and they showed not the least remorse
for the crime, but added new villanies to it, such
as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a
poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps
could not, understand to do what he directed,
and to wound him in such a manner as made
him a cripple all his life, and in a place where
no surgeon or medicine could be had for his
cure; and what was still worse, the murdercus
intent, or, to dojustice to the crime, the inten-
tional murder, for such to be sure it was} as
was afterwards the formed design they all laid,
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood. and in
their sleep. .LDVIN'I'URII Ol' 'OBIKION CIUIOI.

It was not long before they biou'ht the teen
in, and inquiring where they had been, and
what they had been doing, they gave them a
hill amount of their voyage in a few words,
viz. That they reached the landin two days,
or something less; but finding the people
alarmed at their coming, and preparing with
bows and arrows tofight them, they durat not
go on allure, but sailed on to the northward six
or levcn hours, till they came to agreet open-
ing, by which they perceived that the land
they saw from our island wu not the main,
but an island; upon entering that opening of
the sea, they saw "bother inland on tlto right
hand, north, and aeveral more west; and being
resolved to land somewhere, they put over to
one of the islands which lay west, and went
boldly on shore: that they found the people
very courteous and friendly to them; and that
they gave them several roots and some dried
fish, and appeared very sociable ; audthe wo-
men as well as the men were very forward to
stimily them with any thing they could get for
them to eatl and brought it to them a great
way upon their heads.

They continued here four days: and in-
quired, as well as they could ofthem, by Iigns,
wltnt nations were this way, and that way;
and were told of aoveral fierce and terrible
people that lived almoat every way, who, as
they made ltnown by eigntt to them. mod to
not men; but aa for themselves, they said,
they never eat men or women, except only
such as they took in the wars; and then, they
owned, they made a great feast, and ate their
prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired when they had had
a feast of that kind ', and they told them about
two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and to
two fingers; and that their great king had two
hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in
his war, and they were feeding them to make
them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen
seemed mighty desirous of seeing those pri-
son-m : but the other! mistaking them, thought
they were desirous to have some of them to
carry away for their own eating; so they
beckoned tothem, pointing to the settingot'the
sun, and then to therieing; which we! to rig-
nify. that the next morning at aunrising they
would bring aeme for their, and, accordingly,
the next morning, they brought down five
women and eleven men, and gave them to
the Englishmen, to carry with them on their

sight, and they did not ltnow what to do. To
refuse the prieonera would have been the
highest atfront to the savage gentry that could
be ofl'ered there, and what to do with then:
they Itnew not. However, atler aorne debate,
they reaolved toaccept of them; and, in re-
turn, they gave the ravages that brought them
one of their hatcheta, an old key, a knilit, and
air or seven of their bullets: which, lbtrugll
they did not understand their use, they Icem-
ed particularly pleaeed with; and then tying
thepoor creaturcs' hnnda behind them, they
dragged the prisoners into the boat the our
men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come
away as soon as they had them, or else they
that gave them tltia noble nt would cer-
tainly have expected that they should have
gone to work with them, have killed two or
three of them the next morning, and perhaps
have invited the donor! todinner. But hav-
ing taken their leave, with all the reaped and
thanks that could well pass between mule,
where, on either aide, they underrtoefl not
one word they could say, they put oli' with
their boat, and came baelr towards the int
island; where. when they arrived, they net
eight of their prisoners at hbetty, there being
too many ofthom for their occarion.

In their vogue, they endeavoured to have
name communication with their prisoners;
but it was i ible to make tltcnt under-
stand any thing; nothing they could say to
them, or give them, or do for them, but war
looltcd upon as going to murder them. They
first of all unbound them; but the poor crear
tum acreamed at that, especially the women,
as if they had just felt the ltnife at their
throats; for they immediately concluded they
were unbound on purpose to be killed. If
they gave them anything to eat, it waa the
same thing; they then concluded, it was for
fear theyahould sink in Beah,andaoootbe
fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of
them more particularly, the party presently
concluded, it was to see whetherheorshe was

Bu the wonder of th'n etory wee, how five
and: refractory, ill matched fellowmahould agree
about these women, and that two of tires;
should not pitch upon the same woman, espe-
cially seeing two or three of them were, with-
out comparison, more agreeable than the others:
but they took a good way enough to prevent
quarrelling among themselves; for they act
the five women by themselves in one of their
'huts,and they went all into the other hut, and
drew lots among them who should choose first.

He that drew to choose first went away by
himselfto the but where the poor naked ma,
lures wore, and fetched out her he chose , and
it was worth observing, that he that chose first
took her that was reckuwd the homeliest and
oldest of the five, which made mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards
laughed at it: but the fellow considered better
than any of them, that it was application and
litIsincss they were to expect assistance in, as
much as in any thing else; and she proved the
best wife of all the parcel.

When the poor women saw themselves set
in a row thus, and fetched otit one by one, the
terrors of their condition returned upon them
again, and they firmly believed they were now
going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the
English sailor me in and fetched out one of
them, the rent set up a most lamentable cry,
and hung about her, and took their leave of her
with such agonies and affection, as would have
grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor
was it pomible for the Englishmen to satisfy
them that they were not to be immediately
murdered, till they fetched the old man. Friday's
father, who immediately let them ltnow that
the five men, who had fetched them out one _by
one, had chosen them for their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped
them; and in a few hours they had built them
every one a new but or tent for their lodging
apart: for those they had already were crowd-
ed with their tools, household-stud, and provi-
sions. The three wicked ones had pitched
farthest of, and the two honest one! nearer,
but both on the north shore of the island, so
that they continued separated as before; and
thin my island was peopled in three placer;
and, as 1 might say, three towns were begun
to be built.

And here it' Isvery well worth

wise ends of God's providence are in such a
disposition of things, I cannot say,) the two

and ingenious wivee' not that the first two
were bad wivtu, as to their temper or humour,
f ir all the five were most willing, quiet, pas-
sive, and subjected creatures, rather like
slaves than wives, but my meaning is, they
were not alike capable, Ingenious, or indus-
triotu, or alike cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the
honour of a diligent application, on one hand,
and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle
temper, on the other, that when I came to the
place, and viewed the several improvements,
plantings, and management of the several little
colonies, the two men had so far otttgone the
three, that there was no comparison. They
had, indeed, both or them as much ground laid
out liir corn u they wanted, and the reason
was, because, according to my rule, nature
dictated that It was to no purpose to sow more
com than they wanted; but the difi'erence of
the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences,

unthindecd, of every thing else, was easyto
be seen at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees
planted about their huts, an that when you
came to the place. nothing was tobe seen but
a wood: and though they had twice had their
plantation demolished, once by their own coun-
trytncn, and once by the enemy, as shall be
shown in its place, yet they had restoredall
again, and every thing was thriving and flou-
rishing about them: theyhad grapes planted
in order, and managed like a vineyard, though
they had themselves never seen any thing of
that kind; and by their good ordering their
vines, their grapes were as good again as any
of the others They had alsofound themselvet
out a retreat in they thickest part ofthe woods
where, h there was not a natural cave, as
I had found, yet they made one with inceaam
labour of their hands, and where, when the
mischief which followed they secured
their wives and children, so as they could
never be blind; they having, by sticking innu-
merable stakes and poles of thewood which,
as I said, grew so readily, made the grove un-
paaeable, except in some places where they
climbed uptogetovertheoutsidepart,and
then went on by ways of theirown leaving.

and they, on the other hand, verified Solomon's
words in another plece, "that the diligent

thrived, and they had plenty within and with-
out; they had more tame cattle then the others,
more utensils and necessaries within doors,
and yet more pleuure and diversion too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very
handy end cleanly within doors, and having
learned the English weys of dressing and
cooking from one If the other Englishmen,
who," I eeid, was e ceolt'emeteon board
the ship, they dressed their hushends' victuels

nicely and well; whereas the others
couldnotbehronghttounderstand it; hutthen
the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's

ot' the three wives, they loitered about, fetched
turtles' eggs, and caughtftsh and birds; in a
word, any thing but labour, and they fired ac-
cordingly. The diligent lived wellend corn-
fortahly; and the slothful lived hard and beg-

is all over the world.

But I nowcome to a scene difi'erent from all
that had happened before, either to them or to
me; and the original ot'the etorywes this:

This was,withoutdooht,very right; hute
disasterspoiledall these names, end made
it known the savages that there were
inlnhitants there; which was, in the end, the
desolation ot'elrnnst the whole colony. Alter
the canoes with the savages were gone 08',
the Spaniards abroad again; and sense
of them had the curiosity to go to the place
where they had been, to see what they-had
been doing. Here, to their greet surprise,
they litunxl three savages left behind. and lying
fast asleep upon the ground. It was so
they had either been no gorged with their in-
human feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen
asleep. and would not etir when the others
went, or theyhad wnrrlcred into the wootb,
end did not come back in time to he taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised et
this sight, and perfectly at n lees what to do.
The Spanish governor, as it happened, was
with then, end his advice was asked, but he
professed he knew not whet to do. Ast'or
slaves, they had enough already: and as to
killing thorn, they were none of thorn inclined
to that: the Spanish gore-nor told me, the
could not think of sheddinginnocent blood:
for es to them, the poorcreetures heddone
then: no wrong, invaded none of their property.
and they thought they had no just quarrel
against them, to take ewey their lives. And
hereIImtst,injusticetotheseSpeniards, ob-
serve, that let the accounts of Spen'uh cruelty
in Mexico and Peru he what they will, I
never met with seventeen men of any nation
whatsoever, in eny foreign country, who were
so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so
very good honoured, and so courteous, as
these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had
nothingof it in their very nature: no inhu-
manity, no herberity, no outrageous pessim;
endyet ellot' themnsenofgrostcotngeand

discoverthatthere were inhabitants in it; and
so they should be undone that way. Upon this
they went back again, and there lay the fol-
lows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to
walten them, and take them prisoners; and
they did so. The poor lisllows were strangely
frightened when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid, like the women, that tltey
should be murdered and eaten: lix it seems
those people think all the world does as they
do, eating men's flesh; but they were soon
made easy as to that, and away they carried
them.

it was very happy cor tltem that they did
not carry them home to their cutie, I mean
to my palace under the hill: but they carried
tltem first to the bower, where was the chief
of their country work, such as the keeping the
goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and alter-
wards they carried them to the habitation of
the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it wasnot
notch they had for them to do; and whether
it was by negligence in guarding them, or
that they thought the fellows could not mend
themselves, I know not. but one of them ran
away, and taking to the woods, they could
never hear ofhim any more.

canoes of savages who came on shore three or
four weeks afterwards; and who, carrying on
their revels as usual, went off in two days
time. This thought terrified them exceed-
ingly: fur they concluded, and that not with-
out goed cause indeed, that if this fellow came
home safe among his comrades, he would earn
taiuly give them an account that there were
people in tho island,and also how few and
weak they were; for this Savage, as I ub-
lervecl before, had never been told, and it was
very happy he had not, how many there were,
or where they lived; nor had he ever seen or
heard the tire of any of their guns, much less
had they shown him any of their other retired
places ; such as the cave in the valley, or the
new retreat which the two Englishmen had
made, and the like.

Tito first testimony they had that this fel-
low ltad given intelligence of them was, that
about two months after this, six canoes ol'
savages, with about seven, eight. or ten men
in a canoe, came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to come
before, and landed. about an hour after sunrise,
at a convenient place, about a mile from the
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this
escaped man had been kept. As the Spa-

uiard governor said, had they been all there,the
damage would not have been so much, for not
a man of them would have escaped: but the
case difi'ered now very much, ibr two men to
fillywastoomuchodds. Thetwomenhadthe
happiness todiseover them about a league <<If, so
thstit was above an hour More they landed ;
and as they lutdeds mile from their huts, it
was some time before they could come at
them. New, having great reason to believe
that they were betrayed, the first thing they
did was to bind the two slaves which were
left, and cause two of the three men when they
brought with the women (who, it scents,
proved Very faithful to them) to lead them,
with their two wives, and whatever they could
carry away with them, to their retired places
in the woods, which I have spoken of above,
and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot,
till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the ravages were
all come on shore, and that they had bent their
course directly that way, they opened the
fences where the milch goats were kept, and
drove them all out; leaving their goats to strag-
glo in the woods, whither they pleased, that
the savages might think they were all bred
wild ; but the rogue who came with them was
too cunning for that, and gave them an ac-
cetmt of it all, for they went directly to the
pine.

When the two poor frightened men had
secured their wives and goods, they sent the
other slave theyhad of the three who came
with the women, and who was at their place
by accident, away to the Spaniards with all
speed, to give them the alarm, and desire
speedy help; and, in the mean time they
took their arms, and what ammunition they
had, and retreated towanh the place in the
wood where their wives were sent: keeping
at a distance, yet so that they might see, if
possible, which way the savages took.

They had not gone far, but that from a
rising ground they could see the little army of
their enemies come on directly to their habi-
tation, and, in a moment more, could see all
their huts and household etufl' flaming up to-
gether, to their great grief and mortiftcation
for they had a very great loss, to them irre-
trievable, at least for some time. They kept
their station for a while, till they found the sa-
vagcs, like wild beasts, spread themselves all
over the place, rummaging every way and
every place they could think of, in search of
prey -. and in particular tin the people, of whom,
now, it plainly they had intell'genee.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking
themselves not secure where they stood, be-
cause it was likely some of the wild people
might come that way, and they might come too
many together, thought it proper to make ano-

ther retreat about a half a mile farther: be-
lieving, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled the fewer would be to
gether.

 

' SECTION XXXVI.

SEVERAL SAVAGES KILLED; THE REMINDER LEAVE THE ISLAND----A FLEET
OF THEM AFTERWABDS ARRIVE.--A GENERAL BATTLE.--'.I'Hl [SAVAGEB ARE
OVERCOME, AND TRANQUILLITY RISTORED-

Tnnm next halt was at the entrance into
a very thick grown part of the woods, and
where an old trunk of a tree stood, which
was hollow and vastly large; and in this tree
they both took their standing, resolving to see
there what might ofl'er. They had not stood
there long, before two of the savagesappeared
running directly that way, as if they already
had notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little way
farther they espied three more coming alter
them, and five more beyond them, allcoming
thesame way: besides which, they saw seven
or eight more at a distance, running another
way; for, in a word, they ran every way,
like sportsmen heating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity
whether they should stand and keep their pos-
ture, or fly; but, after every short debate with
themselves, they considered, that if the sa-
vages ranged the country thus before help
came, they might perhaps find out their retreat
in the woods, and then all would he lost; so
they resolved to stand them there; and if they
were too many to deal with, then they would
get up to the top of the tree, fiom whence
they doubted not to defend themselves, fire
excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted,
though all the savages that were landed, which
was near fifty, were toattaek them.

Having resolved upon this, they next con-
sidered whether they should fire at the first
two, or wait for the three, and sotake the
middle party, by which the two and the five
that followed would be separated; atlength
they resolved to lot the first two pass by, unless
theyshouldspy theminthe tree,andeomo to
mum. Thefirsttwosavagesconfirmed
them also in this regulation, by 'turning a
little fi'om them towards anotherpart of the
wood; but the three, and the five alter them,
came forward directlyto the tree, asifthey
had known the Englishmen were there. See-

ing them come so straight toward them, they
resolved to take them in aline as they came;
and as they resolved to fire but one at a time,
perhaps thefirst shot might hit them all three:
for which purpose, the man who was tofire put.
three or four small bullets into his piece; and .
having a fair loophole, as it were, from a
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim,
without being seen, waiting till they were
withinabout thirty yards ofthe tree, so thathe
could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the sa.
vages came on, they plainly saw that one of
the three was the runaway savage that had
escaped from them; and they both knew him
distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, hu
should not escape, though they" should hov-
fire; so the other stood ready with his piece,
that if he did not drop at the first shot, he
should be sure to have asecond. But the
firstwas toogoed amarkamantorniss his
aim; for as the sa kept near one ano-
ther, a little behind, in a line, he fired, and hit
two of them directly: the foremost was killed
outright, being shot in the head; the second,
which was the rumiway Indian, was shot
through the body, and fell, but was not quite
dead; and thethird hadalittlescratchinthe
shoulder, perhaps by the same hall that went

the hod'yot' the second; and being
dreadfully frightened, though not so much hurt,
sat down upon the ground, screaming and
yelling in a hideous manner.

The live that were behind, more ii'ightened
with the noise than sensible of the danger,
stoodstill at first; ft>> the woods made the
sound a thousand times bigger than it really
was, the echoes ranting from one side to ano-
ther, and the fowls, rising from all parts,
screaming, and every sort making a difi'eront
nobo,aceording to their kind; just as it was
when! firedthefirstgunthatperhapswu
ever shot on? in the 'nland-
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

However, all being silent again, and they
not knowing what the matter was, came on
unconcerned, till they come to the place where
their companions lay, in a condition miserable
enough; and here the poor ignorant creatures,
not sensible that they were within reach of
the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over
the wounded man, talking, and, as may be
supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be
hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe,
told thein, that a. flash of fire first, and imme-
diately aller that thunder from their gods, had
killed those two and wounded him; this, I say,
is rational; for nothing is more certain than
that, as they saw no man near them, so they
had never heard a gtm in all their lives, not
so much as heard ofa gun ; neither knew they
any thingol'killingand wounding at a distance
with fire andbullets: if they had, one might
reasonably believe they would not have stood
eo unconcerned in viewing the fate of their
fellows, without some apprehensions of their
own.

Our women, though, as they confessed to
me, it grieved"them to be obliged to ltill so
many poor cesium, who, at the same time,
had ,no notion of their danger; yet,'baving
them sll'thus in thelrpower, and the first hav-
ing loaded his piece again, resolved to lot fly
both together among them; and singling out,
by agreement, I'vhidt to aim at, they shot to-
gether, and killed, or very much wounded, four
ot'them; the fifthflrigbtmed even to death,"

though not hurt, fill with the rest; so that on
men seeing them all fall together, thought tl.ay
had killed them all.

> The belief that the savages were all killed
made our two men come boldly out from the
tree before they had charged their guns,,which
was a. wrong step; and they were under some
surprise when they come to the plnce, and
found no less than four of them alive, and of
them two very little hurt, and one not at all:
this obliged them to fell upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made
sure of the runaway savage, that had been the
cause of all the mischief, and of another that
was hurt in the knee, and put them out of their
pain: then the man that was hurt not at all
came and kneeled down to them, with his two
hands held up, and made piteous moans to
them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but
could not say one word to' them that they could
understand. However, they made signs to
him tosit down at the foot of a tree hard by;
and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of'
rope twined, which he had by great chance
in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him,
and there they left him: and with what speed
they could made afier the other two, which
were gone.before, fearing they, or any more ol' '
them, should find the way to their covered
place in the woods, where their wives, and
the few goods they hnd leit, lay. They came

and could see nobody tint hurt them; but
\Vill Atkins, staying to load again, discovered
the cheat; some of the savages who were at
a distance spying them, canto upon them
behind; and though Atkins and his men tired
at them also, two or three times, and killed
almvn twenty, retiring ufast as they could,
yet they Wounded Atkins himself, and killed
one of his fiallow Englishmen with their arrow,
as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one
of the ltulian slaves who came with the wo-
nten. This slave was a most gallant follow,
and liltght most desperately, killing live of
them with his own hand, having no weapon but
one of the armed stave: and a hatchet.

Unr men being thus hard laid at, Atkins
wmtndt-ul, and two other men killed. retreated
toa rising ground in the wood; and the Spa-
niards, after firing three volleys upon them,
retreated also; for their number was so great,
and they were so desperate, that though above
fifty of them were killed, and more than as
many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth
of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their
arrows like a cloud; and it was observed that
their wounded men, who were not quite dis-
abled, were made outrageous by their wounds,
and fought like madmen.

\Vlt-'n our men retreated, they left the Spa-
niard and the Englishman that were killed,
behind them; and the savages, when they
mine up to them, killed them over again in a
wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs,
and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords,
like true savages; but finding our men were
gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but
drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it
seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in
token of their victory; after which, they had
the mortification to see several of their wound-
ed men fall, dying with the more less of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his
little body up together upon a rising ground,
Atkins, though he was wounded, would have
had them march and charge again all together
at once: but the Spaniard replied; Sfiflhw
Atkins, you see how their wounded raon fight:
let theta alone till morning; all the wounded
men will be stid' and sore with their wotutds,
and faint with the less of blood; and 90 W0
shall have the fewer to engage. This "M"
was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily,

niard, you have behaved gallantly, and done
your part; we will fight for you, if you cannot

come on; but I think it best to stay till morn-
ing: so they waited.

But as it was a clear rrmnlight night, and
they found the savages in great disorder about
their dead and wounded men, and a great noise
and hurry among them where they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the
night; especially if they could come to give
them but one volley before they were discover-
ed, which they had a fair opportunity to do:
for one ot'the Englishmen, in whose quarter it
was where the tight began, led them round
between tlto woods and the seaside westward,
and then turning short south. they came so near
where the thickest of them lay, that, Indian
they were seen or heard, eight of them tired in
arming them, and did dreadful execution upon
them; in half a minute more, eight other!
fired after them, pouring in their small shot in
such a quantity, that abundance were killed
and.wounded; and all this while they were
not able to see who hurt them, or which way
to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the ut-
most expedition, and then divided themselves
in three bodies, and resolved to fall in among
them all together. They had ineach bodyeight
persons, that is to say, twenty-two and the
two women, who, by the way, fought despe.
rately. They divided the firearms equally in
each y, and so the halberds and slaves.
They would have had the women kept back,
but they said they were resolved to die with
their husbands. Having thus formed their
little army, they marched out from among the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy,
shouting and halloeing as loud as they could;
the savage: stood altogether, but were in the
utmost confusion. hearing the noise of our men
shouting from three quarters together: they
would have fought if they had seen us; for as
soon as we come near enough to be seen, some
arrows were shot, and old Friday was
wounded, though not dangerously: but our
men gave them no time, but, running up to
them, fired among them three ways, and then
fell in with the but-ends of their muskets, their
swords, armed stoves, and hatebots, and laid
about them so well, that, in a word, they set
up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to
save their lives which way aoever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, and
killed or mortally wounded in the two fights
about one hundred and e' hty of them; the
rest, being frightened out 0 their wits, scoured
through the woods and over the hills, with all'
the speed fear and nimble feet could help theta
to; and as wedidnot trenbleourselvesm
to purluo them, they got all together to the
aeuide where they landed, and where their

canoe- lay. But their dinner was not at an
end yet; for it blewaterrible atorm of wind
that evening from the sea, on that it waa irn-
poeaihle liir them to go off; nay, the norm eon-
tinuiug all night, when the tide came up, their
canoes were most of them driven by the surge
of the tea to high upon the there, that it
tuptired inlinite toil to get them 00'; and some
of them were even dulled to pieces against the
beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet
got little rest that night; but having refrexhcd
themselves at well as they could, they resolved
to march to that part of the island where the
aavngee were tied, and mo what posture they
wore in. This momarily led them over the
place where the fight had been, and where
they found aoveral of the poor creatures not
quite dead, and yet pant recovering life; a
sight disagreeable enough to generous minds;
for a truly great rnan, though obliged hy the
law of battle to deetmy his enemy, lattes no
delight in his misery. However, there was no
need to give any orders in this cue; for their
own savages, who were their aervanL-t, tlospalclt-
ed these poor creatures with their hatehots.

At length, they came in viewol' the place
where the more miserable remains of the ra-
vages' army lay, where there appeared about a
hundred still: their posture wu generally eit-
ting upon the gt'ound, with their kttoca up
towunls their mouth, and the head put between
the two hands, leaning down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-
ahots ol' them, the Spaniard governor ordered
two musket: to be tired, without ball, to alarm
them: this he did, that by their countenance
he might know what to expect, viz. whether
they were atill in heart to fight, or were so
heartily beaten u to be dilpirited and discou-
raged, and no he might manage accordingly.
This mratapm took; for u anon on the ra-
vagee heard the tint gun and saw the flash of
the aoeondpthey atarted up upon their feet in
the greatest consternation imaginable: and on
our men advanced awiltly towarda them. they
all ran meaning and yelling away, with a
kind of howling noise, which our men did not
undoratand, and had never heard before : and
time they ran up the hilla into the country.

At lirat our men had much rather the wea-
tlter had been calm, and they had all gone
away to tea; but they did not then consider
that title might probably have been the occa-
aion of their coming again in each multitudes
tenant to be mintedmr, atleaat, to come so

many, and no onen, as would quite desolate
the ialand, and atarve them. Will Atkins,
therefore, who, notwithutanding hi- wound,
kept alwaya with thorn, proved the beat coun-
aeller in thin case: his advice was, to take the
advantage that offered, and clap in between
them and their boats, and aodeprive them of
the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague tlto island.

They consulted long about this; and some
were against it, for fearot'making the matches
fly to the woods and live there dinnwrntc, and
:0 they ahmtld have them to hunt like wild
beads, be afraid to atir out abOut their hunti-
near, and have their plantation cunliuually
ritlud, all their tamn goat: destroyed, and,
in short, he reduced to a life of continual
dintrciut. .

Will Atkins told them they had better have
to do with a hundred mun than with a hundred
nations: that as they must deutroy their llflilll,
no they must destroy the men. or be all of
them destroyed themselves. In a word, he
showed them the ttucettsily of it so plainly,
that they nll came into it: so they went to
work immediately with the brute, and getting
some dry wood higolhor from a dead tree, they
tried to not me ol'lhem on fire, but they were
no wet that they would not burn; however,
the tire no bumed the upper part, the! it soon
made them unfit for swimming in the sea In
boats. When the Indians saw what they Were
about, met! them came running out of the
woods, and coming u near as they could to our
men, kneeled down and cried, " 0a, (la. "la-
rauiokoa," and sortie other words of their lan-
guage, which none of the other: nutlerstwd
any thing of; but as they made pitiful gesture:
and strange noises, it with carry to understand
they begged to have their borne spared, and
that they would be gone, and never come
there again. But our men were now satisfied
that they had no way to preserve them-<<elves,
or to aave their colony, but elli-ctually to pre-
vent any of there people from ever going
home main: depending upon this, that if even
no nutchaa one of them got back into their
country to tell the atory, the colony was un-
done; In that, letting them know that they
rhuuld not have any mercy, they 11-" to work
with their canoea, and destroyed them every one
that the atom had not destroyed before: at
the aightol' which the aavagea raised a Inde-
oua cry in the womb, which our people heard

inland like distracted men: an that, In a word,

do with them. Nor did the Spaniarda, witmutations or mouse: cnusos. 169

all their prudence, consider, that whilethey
mode those people this desperate, they ought
to hoveltept a good guard at the sometime
upon their plantetions; for though, it is true,
they had driven sway their tattle, end the
Indians did not find out their main retreet, I
men my old castle at the hill, nor the cove if.
the valley, yet they found out my plantation at
the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and Ill
the fences end planting about it; trod all the
com under foot, tore up the vines and propel,
being just then slmoet ripe, and did our men
an inultimnblo dunngo, though tothemselves
not one t'srthing's worth ot'oerVIce.

Though our men were nble to fight them
upon nll occuions, yet they were in no con-
dition to pursue them, or hunt them up and
down; for us they were too nimble of foot for
our men, when they found them single, so our
men durst not go abroad tingle, for fear of
being eurrounded with their numbers. The
best wen, they hid no weapons; for though they
had hows. they had no arrows lefl, nor my
materials to make any; nor had they soy edge-
tool or weapon among them.

The extremity Ind dietreu they were re-
duced to wnsxrent andindeed deplorable; but,
at the some time, our men were also brought
to very bad circumstances bythom: for though
their retreats were preserved, yet their provi-
sion wan destroyed, end their harven wooded;
and whet to do, or which way to turn them-
selves, they ltnew not. The only refuge they
had now wu,the etook of cattle they had in the
valley bythe cave, and some little corn which
grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades,
who were now reduced to two: one of them
being killed by an arrow, which Itruelt him on
the side of hi] hend.jttlt under the temples, no
thnt he never spoke more: and it was very ten
marksble, that this was the some barbarou-
t'eilovr that out the poor savage elnve with hie
hatchet, end who nflemrds intended to have
murdered the Spaniards.

I looked upon their one to have been worse
et this time than mine was st any time, Ifler
I first discovered the graine of burley and rice,
and got into the manner ot'plenting nnd rais-
in; my corn, and mytame cattle: for now they
hed, u I may say, a hundred wolves upon the
island, which would devour every thing they

of; for. except when they canto to bug victuala
and directions, they never came out of their
bounds: and there they lived when I came to
the inland. am] I went to m them.

They had taught thorn both to plant corn,
make broad, breed tante goats, and milk thorn:
they wanted nothing but wives. and they noon
would have been a nation. They were con-
t'tnnd to a neck of land. surrounded with high
rot-ks llt'ltllltl them. and lying plain towards
the son lwl'nru them, on the northeast corner
of the island. They had land enough, and it

after their conntrymen: and if they had, it.
would have been very hard to have found

Then, I think, I have given afull account. of

WM very remarkable. viz. that they taught tho

Will Atkim, who was now ht'flmm a very
industrious, unel'ul. and mher fidlow, ho had
made hinutelf ltucll a tent of basket-work, as, I
believe, wan never net'n; it was one hundred
and twenty paces: round on the <<amide, all
measured by my tin-pa; the walls were an close
worked as ahukul, in panel: or squares of
thirty-two in nuntltor and vnry etrona, stand-
ing about nun-n feet high: in the middle vraa

ltllowud abundaneo of ingenuity in loveral
thing: which he had no knowledge of: he
made him aforgu, with a pair of wooden
bellow: to blow thetire; he made himoeK
charcoal forhia work; and he fanned out of
the iron cram a middling good anvil to ham-
mer upon: in this manner he undo many

the house: Alter hit but pitched tile roof of
his innermost tent. ho Worked it up between
the roller- with basket-work. no firm, ond
thatched that over again so ingeniously with
rice Itraw, and over that a large lt-at'ot'a tree,
which covered lltu top, that hi: home was as
dry u if it had been tiled or elated. Indeed,
he owned that the lavage: had made the
baakebwork for him. The outer circuit Wu
eovered as a lean-to, all round this inner
apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-
vtwo anglosto the top posts of the inner house,
being about twenty feet distant; so that there
was a space like a walk within the outer
wicker wall and without the inner, near
twenty feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned off with the
same wicker-work, but much fairer, and di-
vided into 'aix apartments, so that he had six
rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these
there was a door; first into the entry, or oom-
ing into the merit tent, another door into the
main tent, and another door into the space or
walk that was round it; so that walk was also
divided into six equal parts, which served not
only for a retreat, but to store up any necessaries
which the family had occasion for. These air
spaces not taking up the whole circumference,
what other apartments the outer cimle had were
thus ordered z--Ascoon as you were in at the
door of the outer circle, you had ashorl passage
straight before you to the door of the inner
house ;but on either side was awicker partition,
and a door in it, by which you went first into a
large room, or storehouse, twenty-feet wide,
and about thirty feet long, and through that
into another, not quite so long;'so that in the
outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six

. of which were only to be come at through the

apartments of the inner tent, and served as
closets or retiring rooms to the respective
chambers of the inner circle; and four large
warehouses, or barns, or what you please to
call them, which went through one another,
two on either hand of the passage, that led
through the outer door to the inner tent.

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was
never seen in the world, 'nor a house or tent
so neatly contrived, much less so built. In
this great bee-hive lived the three families,
that is to say, Will Atkins and his compa-
nion; the third was killed, but his wife re-
mained, with three children, for she was, it
seems, big withchild when he died: and tho

1'71

other two were not at all backward to give
the widow her full share of every thing, I mean
as to their corn, milk, grapes, Ste. and when
they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shore; so that they all lived well enough;
though, it was true, they were notso indusn
trious as the other two, as has been observed
already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitwd, viz.
that as for religion, I do not know that there
was any thing of that kind among them: they
often, indeed, put one another in mind that
there was a God, by the very common method
of seamen, viz. swearing by his name: nor
were their poor ignorant savage wives much
better for having been married to Christians,
as we must call them; for as they knew very
little of God themselves, so they were utterly
incapable of entering into any disuturse with
their wives about a God, or to talk any thing
to them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I
can say the wives had made from them was,
that they had taught them to speak English
pretty well ; and most of their children, which
were near twenty in all, were taught to speak
English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken
manner, like their mothers. There was none
of these children above six years old when I
came thither, for it was not much above seven
years that they had fetched those live savage
ladies over; but they had a!l been pretty
fruitful, (hr they had all children, more or less;
I think the cook's mate's wife was big of her
sixth child; and the mothers were all a good
sort of well governed, quiet, laborious women,
modest and decent, helpful to one another,
mighty observant and subject to their masters,
(I cannot call them husbands,) and wanted
nothing but to be well instructed in the' Chris-
tian religion, and to be legally married; both

which were happily brought about alterwards
by my meals, or, atleast, in conseqm. u.' (i
my coming among them.

BCCLESIAS'HC.

liAt'lSO thus given an account of the co-
lony in general, and pretty mnclt of my run-
agate Englilh, I must say something or the
Spaniards, who were the main body of the
family. and in whose story there are some in-
cidents also remarkable enough.

[had a great many discourses with them
about their circumstances when they were
among the savages. They told me readily
that they had no instances to give of their ap-
plication or ingenuity in that country; that
they Were a pier, mirerable, dejected hand-
ful of people ; tltat if moans had been put into
their hands, yet they had so abandoned them-
selves to despair, and so sunk under tho
weight of their misfivrtuno, tltat tltey thought
of nothing but starving. One of them. a
grave and sensible man, told me he was con-
vinced they were in tlte wrong; that it was
not the part of wise men to give themselves
up to their misery, but always to take hold
of the helps which reason nth-ml, as "'0" for
present support as for fittttre deliverance: he
told me that grief was the must <<useless in-
significant passion in the world, tbr that it
regarded only thing! past, which were ge-
nerally impossible to he recalled, or to be
remedied, but had no views oftltings toconto,
and had no share in any thing that looked
like deliverance, but rather added to the It'-
flietion than pmpuud a remedy; and ttpon
this he repented a Spanish proverb, which
though I cannot repeat injust the same words
that he spoke it in, yet I remmbcr I made it
into an English proverb of my own, thus:

In trouble to be troubled
I: to have your trouble doubled.

He ran on then in remarks upon all the
little improvements 1 had made in my solitude;
my unwearied application, as he called it; and
how I had made a condition which in its cit>>
cunutanoes wasatfirat much woree than theirs,
a thousand times we y then theirs was,
even now when they were all together. He
told me it was remarkable that Englishmen
hadagtoater prescneeot'niind,intheirdis-

tron, than my people that ever he met with:
that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese
Were the worst men in the world to struggle
with misfortunes; for that their first step in
dangers, other the common elli-rts were over,
watt to despair, lie down under it, and die,
without musing their thoughts up to proper
remedies for mom.

i told him their case and mine ditl'ered ex-
ceedingly: that they were cut upon the shore
without necnuries, Without supply bfrtlltl' or
present sustenance, till they could provide;
that, it was true. lhad this disadvantage and
dimtfort, that l was alone; but then the sup-
plies 1 had providentially thrown into my
hands, by the unexpected driving ol' the ship
on shore, was such a help as would have en-
couraged any creature in the world to have
applied hintselfas I had done. Senhor. says the
Spaniard. had we poor Spaniards been in your
case, we should never have got half thou things
out of the ship, as you did: nay, says he. we
should never have found means to ltuve got a
raft to carry them. or tn hut-e got the. nlion
shore without boat or sail: tutd how much lens
should we have <<lone if anyol' tut had been
alone! \Vell, l desired him to abate his unn-
plimentI and go on with the history of their
comingon shore, where they landed. He told
me they unhappily landed at a place where
there were people without [wovisionn where",
had they had the common sense to have put
off to sea again, and gone to another island a
little farther, they had (mod provisions,
though without people; there being an island
that way," they had been told. when: there
were provisions, though no pettjtlt'; that is to
lay, that the Spaniards ol Trinidad had fre-
quently been there, and had filled the island
with goats and hogs at Icveral tinmt, where
they l'tld bred in ouch multitudes. and when
turtle and aeal'owla were in such plenty, that
they eould have been in no Wont of flesh,
though they hadt'onnd no bread: whereas here,
they were only sustained with a few roots and
herbs. which they understood not and whidt

titants gavethsumringlyeeough: andwho
could manhu- no better,uolesstheywould
turn cannibats, and eat tnen's flesh, which was
the greet dointy of their country. '

They gave me an account how tnany ways
they strove to civilize the savages they were
with, end to touch them rational customs in
the ordinary waypt' living. but in vain; and
how they rotorted it upon them, as unjust, that
they, who name there for assistance and sup-
port, should attempt to set up for inatruclore of
those that gave them food; intimating, it
seems, that none should soup in the instruc-
tcrs ot'othcra but those who could live 'without
them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extre~
nitics they were driven to; how sometimes
they were merry days without any fwd at ell,
the island they were upon being inhabited by
a sort of ranges that lived more indolent, and
for that reason were less supplied with the
necessaries of life, than they had reason to
believe others were in the same of the
world: and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous end voracious than those
who had better supplies of food. Also they
added, they muld not but see with what do-
monstrations of wisdom and goodness the
governing providence of God directs the events
of thing in the world; which, they said,
appeared in their circumstances; for if, pressed
by the hardships they were under, and the
barrenness ot' the country where they were,
they had searched alter a better to live in,

to the person and place iota whence all these
neweetnlerts came, but it was inane-able to
expre- it by wovde,t'er their excessive joy
aaesaly driving the. to anaemia. estran-
gsneoe, they had no way to describe them,
but. by telling me they berdered upon ltmacy,
having no way to give ventto their passions
suitable to the sense that was upon them ; that
in some it worked one way, and in some uto-
ther; and that some of them, through a sur-
prim of joy, would burst into tears, others be
stark mad, and others immediately faint.
This discourse extremely afi'ecled me, and
called to my mind Friday's ecstasy when
lte met his later, and the poor people's ecstasy
when I took them up at sea alter their ship
was on fire; the joyof the mate of the ship
when he funnd himself delivered in the place
where lte expected to perish; and my own joy,
when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, I
found a good ship ready to carry me to my
own country. All these th' made me more
sensible of the relation of these poor men, and
more afl'ectcd with it.

Having thus given a view of the state et'
things as I found tltem, I must relate the heads
oLwhnt I did for these people, and the condi-
tion in which I left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too, that they would be troubled no
more with the savages, or, if they were, they
would be able to cut them ofl', if they were
twice as many as before ; so they had no con-
cem almut that. Then I entered into a seri-
ous discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call
governor, about their stay in the island: for
as I was not come to carry any of them elf,
so it would not be just toearry ofl' someand
leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwil-
ling to stay if their strength was diminished.
0n the other hand, I told them I came to
establish them there, not to remove them: and
then I let them know that I had brought with
me relief of sundry kinds for them: that I had
been at a great charge to supply them with all
things necessary, as well for their convenience
as their defence: and that I had such and
such particular persons with me, as well to in-
crease and recruit their number, as by the par-
ticular necessary employments which they were
bred to, being artifieere, to assist them in
these things in which at present they were in
want.

They were all together when I talked thus
to them: and before I delivered to them the
stores I had brought, I askcdthetn, one by one,
if they had entirely forgot and buried the first
animosities that had been among them, and
would shake hands with one another, and en-
gage in a strict friendship and union of in-
terest, that so there might be no mere misun-
derstandings and jealousies.

and good humour, said, they had met with
amiction enough to make 'hem all sober, and
enemies on ton-take them all friends; that,
for his part, he would live and die with them;
and was so farl'mn designing any thing against
the Spaniards, that he owned they had done
nothing to him but what his own mad humour
made necessary, and what he would have done,
and perhaps worse, in theircue; and that he
would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the
foolish and btutish things he had done to them,
and was very willing and desirous of living in
terms of entire friendship and union With
them, and would do any thing that lay in his
power to convince them of it; and as for going
to England, he cared not if he did not go thi-
ther these twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at
first dint-med and excluded Will Atkins and
his two countrymen for their ill conduct. as
theyhad let me know, and they appealed to
me for the necessity they were under to do so ;
but that Will Atkim had behaved himself so
bravely in the great fight they had with the
savages, and on several occasions since, and
had showed himself so faithful to, and con-
cerned for, the general interest of them all,
that they had forgotten all that was past, and
thought he merited as much to be trusted with
arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any
of them ; and they had testified their satisfac-
tion in him, by committing the command to
him, next to the governor himself; and as they
had entire confidence in him, and all his
countrymen, so they acknowledged they had
merited that confidence by all the methods
that honest men could merit to be valued and
tntsted; and they most heartily embraced the
occasion of giving me this assurance, that
they would never have any interest separate
from one mother.

Upon these (rank and open declarations of
friendship, we appointed the next day to dine
all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid
feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate
toeome onshore and drenourdinrm,and
the old cook's mete we had on shore assisted.
We ten shore sixpicees efgoodbsef,
and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's peo-

fill it;and.ia particular, I gave than ten
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of
English beer; things that neither the Spa-
niards nor the English had tsstedl'or many
years, and which, it may be , they
werevery glad of. The Spaniards added to

they might all take an equal quantity of the
goods thatwete for wearing; that is to say,
equal when made up. As, first, I distributed
linen suficient to make everyone of them

exceedingly comfortable to Pthem, having been

that having such a correspondent" I was in
so remote a part of the world, it would malts
then forget that they were loll in a desolate

me not to leave the place without my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I had

tended their Works, as Well under as on the

say, he was u pine, lobe-r, pious, and moat

in his charity, and exemplary in almost every
thing: he did. What then can any one say
against being very senxtible of the vnlueofruoh
a man, ntuwithstamling his profession ? though
it may be my opinion, perhaps, tut well as tho
opinion of others who shall read this, that ho
was mistaken.

The tintl hour that I began to converse with
hitn after he had agreed to go with no to the
East Indies, l lintud reason to delight exceed-
ingly inhis conversation: and he tint began
with me about religion in the must obliging
manner imaginable. Sir, says he, you have
not only under God (and at that ho crowed
his breast) sot-ed my life, but you have ad-
mitted me to go this voyage in your ship,and
by your ohliging civility have taken mo into
your family, giving me an opportunity of free
conversation. Now, sir, you see by tny habit
what my [mili'ssiun is, andl guess by your
nation what yours is; I may think it is my
duty, and dmthth-sx it is so, to me my utmost
endeavours, on all occasions. to bring all the
souls i can to the loam-ledge of tile truth,
and lo emlmwe tho t'alllulit: doctrine; but u
i am here under your lmrmission, and itt your

neter,ax well as indecent-y and good manners,
to be under your government; and therefore
I shall not, without your leave, enter into
any debate on the points of religion in which
we may not agree, farther than you shall giro
me leave.

I told him his carriage was no modest, that
I could not but acknowledge it; that it was
two, we were such people a they called he-
reticv, but that ho was not the first catholic I
had enlivened with, without falling into in-
convenienm, or carrying the questions to any
height in debate ; that he Ihotrld not find hint-
:clt' the worse used for being of a different
opinion from In; and it'wo did not converse
without any dislike on either side. it should
be hil fault, not otnv.

He replied, that he thought all our conver-
sation might be ouily separated from dis-
ptnoo; thatit was not iii-business to up
principle. with every man he convened with ;
and that he nther duind meto convene with
himu'gontlemthan u antigiotr'm; and
Minnow gin himlcava ataaytitaeto
discourse upon religious subjects, he would

readily comply with it, and that he did not,

doubt but I would allow him also to defend
his own opinions as well as he could; but
that, without my leave', he would not break
in upon me with any such thing. He told
mo farther, that he would not cease to do
all that became him, in his otfiee as a priest
as well as a private Christian, to procure
the good of the ship, and the safety of all
that was in her; and though, perhaps, we
would not join with him, and he could not
pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us,
which he would do upon all occasions. In
this manner we convened: and, as he was of
the most obliging gentlemanlike behaviour,
' so he was, if I may be allowed to say so,
. 'a man ofgood sense. and, as I believe. of
great looming. . '
He gave me a most diverting account of his
life, and of the many extraordinary events of
it; of many adventures which had befallen
him in the few years that he had been abroad
in the world; and particularly this was very
remarkable, viz. that in tho voyage he was now
engaged in, he had the misfortune to be five
times shipped and umhipped. and never to go
to the place whither any of the shipshe was
in were at first designed. That his first intent
wu' to have gone to Martinico, and that he
went on board a ship bound thither at St.
Mala: but, being lbrced into Lisbon by bad
weather, the ship received some damage by
running aground in the mouth of the river
Tagul, and was obliged to unload her cargo

I77

there; but finding a Portuguese ship there
bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and
supposing he should easily meet with a vessel
there bound to Martinico, he went on board,
in order tosail tothe Madeiras; but the mas-
ter of the Portuguese ship, being but an in-
different mariner, had been out of his reck-
oning, and they drove to Fayal; where, how-
ever, he happened to find a very good market
for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore
resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but toload
salt atthe isle of May, and to go away to
Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this
exigence but to go with the ship, and had a
pretty good voyage as far as the Banks, (so
they call the place where they catch the fish;)
where, meeting with a French ship bound
from France to Quebec, in the river of Gene-
do, and from thence to Martinico, to carry
provisions, he thought he should have an op-
portunity to complete his first design; but
when he came to Quebec the master of the
ship died, and the vessel proceeded no farther:
so the next voyage he shipped himolf for
France, in the ship that was burned when we
took them up at sea; and then shipped with
us for the East Indies, as l have already said.
Thus he had been disappointed in five voyages,
all, us I may call it, in one voyage, besides
what! shall have occasion tomontion farther
of the some person.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOI-

xxvm.

ROBINSON'S DISCOURSE WITH THE. ECCLESUSTIC AS TO INTRODUCING MAR-
RIAGES AMONG THE PEOPLE.--MABRIAGES PERFORMED.--ATKINS CONVERTS

HIS WIFE.

Hr: came to me one morning, for he lodged
among us all the while we were upon the island,
and it happened tobe just when I was going to
visit the Englishmen's colony, at the farthest
part of the island; I say, he came to me, and
told me, with a very grave countenance, that he
had for two or three days desired an opportunity
of some discourse with me, which he hoped
would not be nlispleasing to me, because he
thought it might in some measure correspond
with my general design, which was, the prosper>>
ity of my new colony, and perhaps might put it,
at least more than he yet thought it was, in the
way of God's blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of
his discourse, and turning a little short, How,
air,saidI, can it be said that we are not in
the way of God's blessing, afier such visible
assistances and wonderful deliverances as we
have seen here, and of which I have given you
a large account 3--" you had pleased, sir, said
he, with a world of modesty, and yet with great
readiness to have heard me, you would have
found no room to be displeased, much lessto
think so hard ofme, that I should suggest that

you have not had wonderful assistances and,

deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf, that
you are in the way of God's blessing, as your
design
but, sir, though it weremoreso than is even
possible to you, yet there may be some among

is exceeding good, and will prosper:.

you that are not equally right in their actions :
and you know, that in the story ofthe children
of Israel, one Achan in the camp removed God's
blessing from them, and turned his hand so
against them, that six and thirty ofthem, though
not concerned in the crime, were the objects
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of
that punishment.

I was sensibly touched with his discourse,
and told him his inference wasso just, and the
whole design seemed so sincere, and was really
so religious in its own nature, that I was very
sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him
to go on: and, in the mean time, because it
seemed that what we had both to say might
take up some time, I told him I was going to
the Englishman's plantations, and asked him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by
the way. He told me he would the more will-
ingly wait on me thither, because there partly
the thing was acted which he desired to speak
to me about; so we walked on, and Ipresstxi
him to be free and plain with me in what he
had to say.

Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give
me leave to lay down at'ew propositions, as the
foundation of what I have to say, that we may
not differ in the general principles, though we
may be of some difl'ering opinions in the pree-
tice of particulars. First, sir, though we differ
in some of the doctrinalarticlat ofreligioo, and
itisveryunbappy itil so,especiallyin the
case hethre us, as I shall show afterwards, yet
there are some general principles in which we
bothagree, viz.thstthere isaGod; and that
thisGod having given us aomestated general
rules for our service and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to od'end him,
either by neglecting to do what he has oom-
manded, or by doing what he has expressly
lorltitlden: and let our difl'crent religions be
what they will, this general principle is readily
owned by us all, that the blessing of God does
not ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning
against his command; and every good Chris-
tian will be afi'ectiooaiely concerned to prevent
any that are under his care living in a total
neglect of God and his commands. It ts not
your men being Protestants, whatever my epi-
nion may he of such, that dbeharges me from
being concerned for their souls, and from en-
deavouring, if tt lies before me, that they should
live' tn as little distance from enmity with their
Maker as possible. especially if you give me
leave to meddle so far to your circuit.

I could not yet imagine what be aimed at,

aeli'forus; andbegged he would explainthe

Why then, air, says he, I will take the liberty
you give me, and therearethree things, which,

because I shall convince you that every one

which, by the way, is nothing ot' a marriage,
no agreement with the women, ae-wives, but
only an agreement among thetmelves, to lteep
them from quarrelling. But, sir,the essence
of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called ll,
being aRoman) eonsistsnot only in the mutual
consentoi' the parties to take one anotheras
man and wife, but tn the formal and legal obli-
gation that there is in the contrast, to compel
the man and woman, at all times, to own and
acknowledge each other; ohliging the man to
abstain from all other women, to engage in no
othercontraet while these subsist, and, on all
occasions, as ability nllowa,toprovide honestly
forthem and their children; and to oblige the
women to the same, or like conditions, mantis
mutandir, on their side. Now, sir, says he,
these men may, when they please or when oo-
casion presents, abandon these women, disown
their children, leave them to perish, and take
other women, and marry them while these are
living: and here he added, with some warmth,

How, air, is God honoured in this unlawfui

right ; but I imagined that, by putting an end to
it, he meant that I should part them, and not
sull'er them to live together any longer: and I
said to him I could not do that, by any means,
for that it would put the whole island into con-
fusion. He seemed surprised that I should so
far mistake him. No, sir, says he, I do not
mean that you should now separate them, but
legally and efi'ectually marry them now ; and as,
air, my way of marrying them may not be easy
toreconcile them to, though it will be efi'ectual,
even by your own laws, so your way may be as
well before God, and as valid among men ; I
mean, by a written contract signed by both man
and woman, and by all the witnemes present,
which all the laws ol'Europe woulddeereeto
be valid.

I was amazed to see so much true piety,
and so much sincerity ofzeal, besides the unu-
sual impartiality in his discourse sets his own
party or church, and such true warmth for pre-
serving the people that he had no knowledge of
or relation to; I say, for preserving them from
transgressing the laws of God, the like of which
I had indeed not met with any where: but,
recollecting what he had said of ' them
by a written contract, which I knew he would
startdto,I remedit backuponhim,andtold
him, I granted all that he had said to be just,
and on his part very kind; thathoulddis-
course with the man upon the point now, when
I came to them; andI knewnoreasonwhy
they should scruple to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to
be as authentic and valid in England as if they
were married by one of our own clergyman.

Whatwas afierwards doueinthismatter,I
shall speak of by itself.

Ithenpressed himtotell mewhat was the
second complaint which he had to make, ae-
hnowledging that I was very much his debtor
fir the first, and thanked him heartly fix it.

He toldmehe wouldnae thesame freedom

theyhadnot, tothis hour, taughtthemany thing
of the Christian religion, no, not so much as to
know that there was aGod, or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served;or that
their own id , and worshipping they know
not whom, was fake and absurd. This, he said,
was an unaccountable neglect, and what God
would certainly call them to accouut for and
perhaps, at last, take the work out of their hands
--he spoke this very afl'ectionately, and warmly.

I am persuaded, says he, has those men
lived in the savage country whence their wives
came, the savages would have taken more pains
to have brought them to he idolaters, and to
worship the devil, than any of these men, so
far as I can see, have taken with them to teach
them the knowledge of the true God. Now,
sir, said he, though I do not acknowledge your
religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad to
see the Devil's servants, and the subjects of his
kingdom, taught to know the general principles
of the Christian religion t that they might, at
least, hear of God and aRedeemer, and of the
resurrection, and of a future state,--things
which we all believe; they had, at least, been
so much nearer aming into the bosom of the
true church than they are new, in the public
profession of idolatry anddevil-worship.

I could hold no longer; I took him in my
arms, and embraced him with an excess ol'pas-
sion. How far, said Itohim, have I been from
understanding the most mential part of a
Christian! viz. to love the interestofthe Chris-
tian church, and the good ot'ether men's souls:
I scarce have known what belongs to the being
aChristian.--0, sir, do not say so, replied he;
this thin is not your fault.----No, said I; but
why did never lay it to heart as wellas you?
--It is not too late yet, said he; benottoo for-
ward to condemn yoursslfi--But what can be
done now ? said I ; you see I am going away.
--Will you give me leave to talk with these
poor men about it? ----Yes, with all my heart,
said I ; and will oblige them to give heed to
what you say tom--As to that, said he, we
must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but
it is business to assist them, encourage
them,and instruct them; and if you give me
leave, and God his blowing, I do not doubt but
thepoor ignorantemrlsshallbebroughthometo

if I can convert these thirty-seven men to the
faith of Jesus Christ, is it not worth my time,
though I should never be fetched off the island
again? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth
to save so many souls than my life is, or the
life of twenty more of the same profession?
Yes, sir, says he, I would give Christ and the
blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be
made the least. happy instrument of saving the
souls of those poor men, though I were never
to set my that off this island, or see my native
country any more. But since you will honour
the with putting me into this work, for which
I will pray for you all the days of my life, I
have one humble petition to you besides.--
What is that? said I. "Why, says he, it is,
that you will leave your man Friday with me,
to be my interpreter tothem, and to twist me;
for without some help I cannot speak to them,
or they to me.

I was sensibly touched atbis requesting Fri-
day, because I could not think of parting: with
him, and that titr many reasons: he had been
the companion of my travels; he was not only
faithful to me, but sincerely nfl'uctionate lo the
last degree; and i had resolved to do Stilllclilillg
considerable for him if lie outlived mt-, as it was
probable he would. Then I knew that as I
had bred Friday up tube a Promtant, it would
quite confound hint to bring hitu to embrace
another profession; and he would never, while
his eyes were open, believe that his old master
was a ltcrutic, and would be damned; and this
might, in the end, min the poor firlluw's prin-
ciples, and so turn him back again to his first
idolatry. However,a sudden thought relieved
me in this strait, and it was this: I told hint I
could not say that I was willing to part with Fri-
day on any account whatever. though a work that
to him was of more value than his life, ought to
be to tilt: of mttch more value than the keeping
or parting with a servant. But, on the other
hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no
means agree to part with me; and! could not
force him to it without his consent, without
mmifest injustice; because I had promised I
would never put him away, and he had pro-
mised and engaged to me that he would never
leave me unless I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he
had no rational amuse to these poor people,
seeing he did not understand one word of their
language, nor they one word of his. To re-
move this difieulty, I told him Friday's father
had learned Spanish, which I found he also
understood, and he should serve himas an in-
terpreter. So he was much better satisfied,
and nothing could persuade him but he would

stay and endeavour to convert them: but Pro-
vidence gave another very happy tttrn to all this.

I come back now to the first part of his ob-
jcetions. When we came to the Eglishrnen,
I sent for them all together, and after some
account given them of what I had done for
them, viz. what necessary things I had provided
for them, and how they were distributed, which
they were very sensible of; and very thankful
for, i began to talk to them of the searshdous
life they led, and gave them a full account of
the notice the clergyman had taken of it; and
arguing how unehristian and irreligious a life it
was, I first asked them if they were married
men or bachelors? They soon explained their
conditions to me, and showed that two of them
were witlowent, and the otltcr three were single
men, or bachelors. I asked them with what
conscience they could take those women, and
lie with them as they had done, call them their
wives, and have so manychildren by them, and
not belawfully married to them ?

They all gave me the answer I expected,
viz. that there was nobody to them; that
they agreed before the governor to keep them
as their wives. and to maintain them and own
them as their wives; and they thought, as
things stood with them, they were as legally
married as if they had been married by a path
son, and with nllthc formulities in the world.

i told them that no doubt they were married
in the sight ot God, and were bound in con-
science to keep them as their wives; but that
the laws of men being otherwise, they might
desert the poor women and children hereafter;
and that their wives being [nor desolate women,
li'iendless and moneyless, would have no way to
help themselves: I therefore told them that,
unless I was assured of their honest intent, I
could do nothing thr them, but would take care
that what [did should be for the women and
children without them; and that, unless they
would give me some assurances that they
would marry the women, I cottld not think it
was convenient they should continue together
as man and wife ; for that it was both scanda-
lous to men and ofi'ensivo to God, who they
could not think would bless them if they went
on thus.

All this wanton as I expeeted: and they
told me, especially \Vill Atkins, who now
seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved
their wives as well u if they had been born in
their own native country, and would not leave
them upon any account whatever; and they did
verily believe their wives were as virtuous and
a modest, and did, to the utmost oftheir skilL
as much for them and for their children, as any
womeneouldpo'ihly do; andtheywould not
part with themott any aeoount: and Will At-
kins, for his own partieular, added, that if any
man would take him away, and ofl'er to carry
him home to England, and make him captain
ofthehestmanot'wsrin the navy, hewould
not gowith him, ifhe might not carry his wife
and children with him; and if there was a
clergyman in the ship, he would be married to
her now with all his heart.

Thiswasjustas Iwouldhave it: thepriest
wasnotwithme atthat moment, butwaanot
farofl'; so, to try himt'arther, I told him] had
a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere,
I would have him married next morning. and
bade him outsider of it. and tallt with the rest.
He said, as for himself, he need not consider
at it atall, for he was very ready to do it, and
was glad I had it minister with me, and he be
licved they would be all willing also. I then
told him that my friend, the minister, was it
Frenchman, and could not English, but
I would act the clerk between them. He never
so muchas asked me whether he was a ist
or Protestant, which was indeed what I was
al'rnid ol'; aowe parted; I wentbadt to my
clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk
with his companions. I desired the French
gentleman not to say any thing to them till
the businesswasthorough ripe; and Itold him
what answer the men had given me.

BelhroI went from their quarter, they all
came to me, andtolrlmetheyhadheeneon-
sidering what I had said; that they were glad
to hear I had a clergyman in my company,
and they were very willing to give me the
satisfactim ldesired, andto he Brutally math
ried as soon as I pleased; for they were far
from desiring to partwiththeirwives, and that
they meant nothing but what was very honest
when they chase them. So I appointed them
to meet me the nenmorning; and, in the mean
time, they should let their wives know the
meaning oftho marriage law ; and that it was
not only to prevent any scandal, but also to
oblige them that they should not forsake them,

whatever might happen.

his interpreter. But the set-imme- or his
behaviour to them, and the acruples he made
of marrying the women bee-use they were not
baptized and professed Christiane, gave them
an exceeding reverence for his person; and
there was housed, afierlhat, to inquire whether
he was a cler or not. Indeed, I was
afiaid his scruples would have been mm'eJ
so far, as that he would not have married them
at all; nay, nothwithstanding tall I was able
to say to him, be resisted me, th mo-
deslly, yet very steadily: and at last refused
absolutely to marry them, unless he had first
talked with the men and the Women too; and
though at first] was a little backward to it, yet
at last I agreed to it with a good will, perceiv-
ing the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, he let them know
that I had acquainted him with their circum-
stances, and with the present design; that he
was very willing to perform that part ot'his time-
tion,andmarry them," I had desired; but
that, heforehe could do it, he must take the li-
berty to talk with them. He told them, that
in the sight of all indifl'erent men, and in the
sense of the [an or society, they had lived all
this while in open fornication; andthat itwas
true, that nothing but the consent' to ,
orefi'eetually separating them from?>> anothmz,
couldnowput an end toil; but therewasa
diflieulty in it too, with respect to the laws of
Christian matrimony, which he was not fully
satisfied about, viz. thatot' marrying one that is
a profmed Christian to a savage, an idolater
and a heathen, one thstis notbaptized: and
yetthathedidnotseethattherewutimelefi
to endeavour to e the women to he
tiled, or to profess the name ofChrist,whotn
they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and
without which they could not be baptized.
He told them he doubted they were but indif-
ferent Christians themselves; that they had but
littleltnowledge ofGod ore! his ways,and there-
fore hecouldnot expect that they hadsaid much
to their wiveson that head yet; but that, unl-
they would promise him to use their endea-
vouu with their wives to persuade them to ho-
eome Christians, and would, as well as they
could, instructthem in theknowledgeandbo-
lief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christthat redeemed them, hemld
notrnarry them l forhewould havonohand
in joining Christians with sane" 3 nor was
it consistent with the principles oftheChristian
religion, and wasindeed exprealy forbid-i-
God's law.

They heard all this very attentively,' I
delivered it very faithfully to than io- H

s
mouth, as near his own words as I could;
only sometimes adding something of my own,
to convince them how just it was, and how I
was of his mind : and I always very fiithfully
diningu'tshod between what I said lionuny-
self, and what were the clergyman's words.
They ltrltl me it was very true what the gen-
llctnnn said, that they were very indifl'erent
Christians themselves, and that they had never
talked to their wives about religion. Lord,
sir, says Will Atkins, how should we teach
_them religion ? why, we ltnow nothing our-
selves; and besides, sir, said he, should we
talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and
heaven and hell, it would make them laugh at
us, and ask us what we believe ourselves lAnd
if we should tell them that we believe all the
things we speak of to thorn, such as of good
people going to heaven, and wicked people to
the devii, they would ask us where we intend
to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are
such wicked fellows as we indeed are ? Why,
sir, 'tis e to give them a surfeit of reli-
gion at first hearing: folkstnust have some reli-
gion themselves before they pretend to teach
other people.--Will Atkins, said I to him,
though I am afraid that what you any has too
much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife
she is in the wrong; that there is a God, and
a religion hetterthanherown; thather godsero
idols ; that thcycan neither hear norspeak;
that there is a great Beingthat made all things,
and thstcandeetroy all thsthe has made; that
he rewards the good and punishes the had; and
that we aretcbejudgedhy him at last for all
we do here '! You are not soignorant, but even
nature itselfwill teach you that all this is true;
and I am satisfied you know it all lobe true,
end believe it yourseliZ--That is true, sir,snid
Atkins; but with what face can I say any
thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell
me immediately it cannot be true?-Not true!
said I ; what do you mean by that?--Why,
sir, said he, she will tell me it mot be true
that this God I shall tell her oi'csn he just, of
can punish or reward, since I meet punished
and sent to the devil, that have been such a
wicked creature as she know I have been,
even toher,andto everybody else; andthat
I should he sufl'ered to live, that have been
alwaysutingsocontrary towhatI musttell
her is good, and to what I ought to have done.
--Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou
speeheettoo much truth; andwith IhatIin-
formedtho clergyman of what Atkins had said,
lithe was impatient to know. 0, said the
'est, tell him there is one thing will make

and that is, ; for none teach repent
anee like true penilents. He wants nothing
but to repent, andthen he will be to much the
hotter qualified to instruct his wife: he will
drenbeabletotellher that there is notonlyn
God,andthntheisthe just rewmlerofgood
and evil, but that he is ammiful Being. and
with infinite ness and longsufl'ering fue-
bears to punish those that offend; waiting to
be gracious, and willing not the death of a
sinner, but rather that heshould return end
live: that oftentimes he suffers wicked men
toga a long time, and even reserves detonation
wthe general dayof retribution: that it is it
clear evidence of God and of a future state,
that righteous men receive not their reward,
or wicked men their punishment, till they
come into another world; and this will lend
him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resur-
rection and of the last judgment. Let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent
preacher of repentance to his wife.

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very
serious all the while, and who, we could ensily
perceive, was more than ordinarily affected
with it: when being eager, and hardly suffering
me to make on end--I know all this, master,
says he, and a great deal more; but I have
not the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when
God and my conscience know, and my wife
will he an undeniable evidence against Inc,
that I have lived tut if I had never heard of a
God or future state, or any thing about it;
and to talk of my repeating, alas! (and with
that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see
that the tears stood in his eyes,) 'tis past all
that with rue--Past it, Atkins 'I said I; what
dost thou mean by thst 'l--I know well enough
What" mean, says he; I mean 'tis too late,
and thet is too true.

I told the clergyman, word fix word, what
he said: the poor zealous priest,--I must cal.
him so, for, be his opinion whet it will, he had
certainly a most singular afi'ection for the good
of other men's south, and it wouldbe hard to
think he had not Ihe like for his ovrn,--l say,
this afl'ectionate man could not refrain from
tears ; hut, recovering himelf, said tome, Ask
him but one question: Is he easy that it is too
isle; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not
so? I putthequestion fairly to Atkins; and
he answered, withagreatdealofpa-ion, How
could anyman be easy ins condition that must
certainly end in eternal destruction? that he
wufarl'rotn being easy; butthat,cnthe con-
trary. he believed it would, one time or other,
ruin him. What do you mean bythat? said
1. Why, he said, he believed he should one

The dcrgyman diook his head, with great
concerninh'ufaee, whenltold him all this;
but turning quick tome upon it,aays, If that
be liiscase, we nmy assure him it is not too

pry, says he, explain this to him; that as no
man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of
his passion [uncaring divine mercy for him,
how can it be too lnte for any man to receive

tell him, there may he a time when provoked

men to ask mercy; and we, that are Christ's
servants, are commanded to preach mercy at

those that aincerely repent: ao thntit is never

and yet there were none of them backward to

riously promised that they would talkwith their
wives about it, and do their endeavours to per-

Upon thisdiseourse,however, and theirpvtr

nearer,forfearot'disturbingthem; aowe re-
solved tom-netllofthis piecoofstill can:
vsrsation, and it spoke loud cough to ll
withoutthehelp ot'voice. Beastdownagain,
asIhave said,clooabyher,and talked apt
carnes'tlytoher, and two or threetimes we
could see him embrace her most passionately;
another time we saw him take out his hand-
kerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her
again, with a kind of trmport very manual;
and afler several of time things, we saw h: _
on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his
hand to help her up, when immediawa leading
her by the hand a step ortwo, they both ltneeled
down together, and continued so about two
minutes.

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries
out aloud, St. Paul! St. Paul! behold he
prayeth. I was afraid Atkins would hear him,
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself
awhile, that we might see an am of the scene,
which to me, I must confess, was the amt
affecting that ever I saw in my life. Well, he
strove with himself for a while, but was in such
ruptures to thinlt that the poor heathen woman
was become a Christian, that he was not able
to contain himself; he wept several times, then
throwing up his hands and erasing his breast,
said over several things ejaculatory, and by
way of giving God thanks tilt- so miraculous a
testimony of the success of our endeavours;
some he spoke softly, and! could not well hear
others; some in Latin, some in French; then
twoorthreo times the tears would interrupt
him, that he could notepcsk stall; but I begged
that he would contain himself, and let us more
narrowly and fully observe what wasbetbre us,
which he did for a time, the scene not being
near ended yet; for allot the poor manand his
wife were risen again from their knees, we
observed he stood talking still eagerly to her,
and we observed her motion, that she was
greatly afl'ucled with what he said, by her fre-
quently lining up her hands, laying her hand
to her breast, and such other postures aseapress
the greatest seriousness and attention: this
continued about half a quarter ofan hour, and
then they walked away: so we could see no
more of them in that situation. I took this
interval to talk with my clergyman; and first,
I was glad to see the particulars we had both
been witnesses to, that, though I was hard
enough ofbeliefin suchcasos, yet that I began
to think it was all very sincere here, both in
the man and his wife, however ignorant they
might both be, and I hoped such a beginning
would yet have a more happy end: And who
koowa, said I, but these two may in time, by
instruction and example, work upon some of
the others i--Some of them'! said be, turning
quick upon me: ay, upon all of them: depend
upon it, if those two savages, for he has been
but little better,av you relate it, should embrace

Jesus Christ. they will never leave it till they
work upon all the rest; for true religion i: na-
turally communicative, and he that is once
mule a Christian will never leave a pagan
behind him, if he can help it. I owned it was
a most Christian principle to think so, and a
testimony of true zeal, as well as a. generous
heart, in him. But, my friend, said I, will
you give me leave tostart one dilficulty here?
I cannot tell how to object the least thing
against. that att'ectionate concern which you
show for the turning the poor people from their
paganism to the Christian religion: but how
does this comfort you, while these people are,
in your account, out of the pale of the catholic
church, without which you believe there is no
salvation ? so that you esteem these but heretia,
andfor other reasons as etl'ootually lea as the
themselves.

To this he answered, with abundance of
candour, thus; Sir, I am a catholic ot' the
Roman church, and a priest ofthe order ofSt.
Benedict,and I embrace all the principles of
the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe
me, andthat I do not speak in compliment to
you, or in respect to my circumstances and
your civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not
look upon you, who call yourselves reformed,
without some charity: I dare not say (though
"(now it is our opinion in general) that you
cannot be saved; I will by no means limit the
mercy of Christ so far as to think that he
cannot receive yott into the bosom of hischumb,
in a manner to us unperceit-able ; and I hope
you have the same charity for us: I pray daily
for your being all restored to Christ's church,
by whatsoever method he. who is all-wise, is
pleased to direct. In the mean time, sure you
will allow it consists with me, as a Roman, to
distinguish far between a proteaaot and a pn-
gan; hetWeen one that calls on Jesus Christ,
though in a way which I do not think is accord-
ing to the true faith, and a savage or a barba-
rian, that knows no God,no Christ, no Redee-
mer; and if you arertot within the pale of the
catholic church, we hope you are nearer being
restored to it than those that Itnovv nothing of
God orof h'n church: and I rejoice, therefore,
whenIsee thispoortnan, whqyou say,hasbeen
a ptofligate, and almosta murderer, kneel down
and prsy to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he
did, though not fully enlightened; believing that
God, from whom saw such work proceeds.
will sensibly touch his heart, and bring hint to
the forther knowledge of that truth in his own
time: and if God shall influence this poor man
to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his
wife,I can nevcrbelim that he shallbecal

back upon our lives, the sins against our in-
dulgent parents are certainly the first thatlouch
us; the wounds they make lie deepest,and the
weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the
mind, ofall the sins we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly
for me, Atkins; I cannot hear it.

W. A. You hear it, master! Idareny you
ltnow nothing of it.

R. C. Yes, Atkins; everyshore,everyhill,
nay, I may say every tree in this island, is
witness to the anguish of my soul for my in-
gratitude and bad usage of a good, tender
father; a father much like yours, by your de-
scription: and! murdered my father as well
as you, "fill Atkins; but I think, for all that,
31y repentance is short of yours too, by a great

CI .

X would have said more, if I could have
restrained my passions; but I thought this
poor man's repentance was so much sineerer
than mine, that I was going to leave 05' the
discourse and retire; for K was surprised with
what he had said, and thought that instead of
my going about to teach and instruct him, the
man was made a teacher and instructor to me
in a most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman,
who was greatly efl'ected with it, and said to
me, Did I notsay, sir, that when this man was
converted he would preach to us all? I tell
you, sir, if this one man bcmade a true peni-
tent, hero willbe no need of me; he will make
Christians of all in the island--But having a.
little composed myself, l renewed my discourse
with \Vill Atkins. But Will, said I, how
comes the sense of this matter to touch you
just now '!

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work
that has struck adart through my very soul; I
have been talking about God and religion to
my wife, in order, as youdirected me,to make
a Christionof her, and she has preached such
a sermon to me as! shall never forget while I
live.

R. C. No, no, it isnot yourwifehas preach-
ed to you; but when you were moving religi-
ous arguments to her, conscience has flung
"hem back upon you.

W. A. Aye, sir, with such force as is not
to be resisted.

R. 0. Pray, Will, let us know what
passed between yousnd your wife; forI know
something of it already.

R.C. But tell ussome ofitabow did you
begin, Will? For this has been an extraordi-
nary case, that is certain. She has preached
a sermon, indeed, ifsbehas wrought this upon

on.

y W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of
our laws about marriage, and what the reasons
were that men and women were obliged to
enter into such compacts, as it was neither in
the power of one not other to break; that
otherwise, order and justice eould not be
maintained, and men would run li-orn their
wives, and abandon their children, mix confu-
sedly with one another, and neither families
he kept entire, nor inheritancee besettlcd by
legal descent.

R. C. You talk like scivilian, Will. Could
you make her understand what you meant by
inheritance and families ? They know no
such things among the savages, but marry any
how, without regard to relation, consangui-
nity, or family; brother and sister, nay, as l
have been told, even the father and the dough-
ter, and the son and the mother.

W. A. lbelieve, sir, you are misinformed,
and my wtfe assures me of the contrary, and
that they abhor it; perhaps. for any farther
relations, they may not be so exact as we are;
but she tells me they never toudt one another
in the near relationship you speak of.

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you
told her'l

\V. A. She said she liked it very well, and
it was much better than in her country.

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage
was?

W.A. Ay, ay; there began our dialogue.
I asked her ifehe weuldbe married to me our
way. She asked me what way that was. I
told her marriage was appointed by God ; and
here we had a strange talk together, indeed, as
ever men and wife had. I believe.

IV. B. This dialogue between Will Atkins
and his wife I tookdown in writing, jut after
he had told it me, which was as follows:

Win. Appointed by your God! Why, have
you a God in your country?

W. A. Yes, my dear. God is in every
country.

Win. No your God in my country; my
country have the great old Benunuckee God.

W. A. Child, 1 am very unfit to show you
who Godis; God is inbeaven, and madetlte

Win. No unaltee de earth;noyou God
nakeo all earth; no malice my country.

Will Atkina laughed n ma. atherexproaeim
d' God not making her country.

Win. No laugh; why laugh me? This
nothing to llugh.

He was justly reprored by his wife, for do
was more serious than he 1t feat.

W. A. That'e true, indeed; I will notlaugh
any more, my dear.

Wu'n. Why, you any you God nukee all 1

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole
world,andyouandlne,and all thinge; for he
istheonlytrue God,andthere ieno God but
him; he lives for ever in heaven.

Wire. Why, you no tell me Ioo'g ago?

\'V. A. That's true, indeed; but I have
been a wicked wretch, and have not only for-
gotten to acquaint thee with my thing before,
but have lived without God in the world mynelt'.

Win. What, have you a great God in
your country, you no know him '! Neely 0 to
him? Nodo good thingfor him? '1'th no
possible.

W. A. It ietrue; though, for all that, we
live as it'there woe noGod in heaven, or that
he had no power on earth.

he no nukee you goodlive?

because he, that was so wicked, was not

W. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I
could tench you to know God, not God to know
you; for he knows you ulready, and every
thought in your heart.

Wire. Why then he know what I say to
you now; he know me wish toknow him; how
shall me know Who makce me ?

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee,
I cannot teach thee; I will pray to him to
teach thee to know him, and fixgive me, that
am unworthy to teach thee.

The poor fellow was in suehanagony at her
desiring him to make her know God. and her
wishing to know him, that. he said he fell down
on his knees before her, and prayed to God
to enlighten her mind with the saving know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins,
and aeceptof his being the unworthy instru-
ment of instructing her in the principles ofre-
ligion: after which he sat down by her again,
and their dialogue went ou.--This was the
time when we saw him kneel down, and hold
up his hands.

Wit-n. What you put down the knee for?
\Vhat you hold up the hand for? What you
any? 'Whoyou speak to? Whatiaallthat'!

W. A. My dear, I how my knees in token
of my submissim to him that made me; I
said 0 to him, no you call it; and as your old
men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I
prayed to him.

W'irr. What you say 0 to him for?

W. A. I prayedto himto open your eyes,
and your Imderstanding, that you may know
him, and be accepted by him.

WIFE. Can he do that too '!

W. A. Yes, he can; hem do allthings.

Win. But now he hear what yousay'!

\V. A. Yes; hehasbidus pray tobim,and
promised to hesir us.

'Wtra. Bid you pray? When he bid you?
How hebid you '1, What, you hear himspeak?

W A. No, we do nothear him speak; but
he has revealed himself many ways to us.

Here howaa atagrcat loss to make her
understand that God has revealed himselt'to us
by his word, and what his wordwas ;but at last
he told it her thus:

'N. A.Godhasspokentosomegoodrnenin
former days, even from heaven, by plain words;
and Godhas inspired good men by his spirit;
andthey have written ah his laws down in a
book.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CBUSOE.

Wm. Me no understand that; where is
book 7

W. A. Alas! my poorcreatnre, Ihsve not
this book;but[ hope I ahalione time or other
get it for you, and help youto read it.

Here he embraced her with great afl'eetion :
but with inexprenible grief that he had not a
Bible.

Win. But how you makes me know that
God teachee them to write that book '!

W. A. By the same rule that we know him
lobe God.

h "gut. What rule? Whatway you know
in

W. A. Becausehe teachesaudeommands
nothing but what is good, righteous, and holy,
and tends tomakeus perfectly good, as well as
perfectiyhappy ; and because he forbids, an!
commands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is
evil in itself, or evil in its consequence.

Wire. That me would understand,that me
fain see ; if he teachee all thin, he
makee all good thing, he give all thing, he
hear me when I say 0 to him," asyou do just
now; he makee megood, iflwishtobo good;
he spare me, no maltee kill menvhcn I no be
good: all this you say be do, yet he be great
God: me take, think, believe him to be great
God ; me say 0 to him with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could Rwhear no longer,
but raised her up, made her kneel by him, and
he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the
knowledge of himself, by his Spirit ; and that t
by some good providence, if pouible, she
might sometime or other come to have a Bible,
that she might read the word of God, and be
taught by it to know him--This was the time
that we saw him lifi her up by the hand, and
saw him kneel down by her, as above.

They had severalother disootmes, it seems,
after this,too long to be set down here; and

articularly she made him in that since

e confessed hisown life had been a wicked
abominable eouree ot'provoeations against God,
tht he would reform it, and not make God
angry any more; lest he should make him
dead, as the called it, and then she would be
left alone, uni never be taught to know this
God better; and lest he should be miserable,
ashe badtnldherwiekedinen wouldbe,ai'ter
death.

This wuasuangeamomgandveryafi'ect-

on hood the ehip ,when dIe young men I
hldtekenoutofthefinliehed ship '-
ametoue, endleldnehemde-nadlhed
aelergymanwithrne, andthat I hadeaused
the Englishmen to be married to the savages;
that he had a match, too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two
Christians, which he hoped would not be dis.
agreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who
was his mother's servant, for there was no
other Christian woman on the island: so I
began to persuade him not to do anything of
that kind rasltly, or because he tbund himself
in this solitary circumstance. 1 represented
to him that he had some considerable animation
in the world, and good friends, as I understood
by himself, and the maid also: that the maid
was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, the being six or seven and
twenty years old, and he not above seventeen
or eighteen; that he might very probably, with
my assistance, make aremovo fromthis wilder~
me, outcome into his own country again ; and
that then it would he a thousand to one bttt he
would repent his choice, and the dislike of that
circumstance mightbe disadvantageous to both.
I was going to say mom, but he interrupted me,
smiling, and told me, with a great deal of "IO-
desty,that I mistook in my guesses, that he
had nothing of that kind in his thoughts; and
he was very glad to hear that I had an intent
of putting them in a nay to see their own
country again; and nothing should have put
him upon staying there, but that the voyage I

was gotng was so exceeding long and hazard- .

one, and would carry him quite out of the
reach of all his friends; that he had nothing to
desire ofrne, but that I would settle him in
some little property in the island where he was,
give him a servant or tvro, and some few neces-
saries, and he would settle himself here like a
planter, waiting the time when, if ever I
returned to England, I would redeem them;
and hoped I would not be unmindl'ul of him
when I came to England: that he would give
me some letters to his friends in London, to let
them know how I had been to him, and
in what part of the world, and what circum-
stance "tad letl him in: and he promised no
that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation,
and all the improvements he had loads it,
let the value be what it would, should be
wholly mine.

His discourse on very prettily delivered,
considering his youth,and was the more
able to me, because he told the positively the
match was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurances that it'I lived to come safe
to England. I would deliver his letters. and do

had left him in : but still I wasitnpatientto know
who was the person tobe married ; upon which
he told too it was myJack ofall trades and his
maid Susan. [was most agreeably eurpfised
when he named the match; liar indeed I thought
it very suitable. The characterot' thatm I
have given already ; andas for the maid,ahe was
a very honest, modest, sober, and religiotn
young woman; hadaverygood ahareol' sense,
was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very
handsomely, and tothe purpose, always with de-
cency and good manners. and tteither too back-
ward to speak, when requisite,nor impenineutly
forwanl,when it was not her business; very
handy and housewifely, and an excellent mana
ger; fn, indeed, to have been governess to the
whole island, and she knew very well how to
behave in every respect.

The match being proposed in this manner,
we marriedthetn the sarneday; and as! was
father at the altar, as I may say, and gave her
away, so I gave her a portion; liar I appointed
her and her husband A handsome large space
of ground ibr their plantation: and, indeed,
this match, and the proposal the young gentle-
man made to give him aatnall property in the
island, put me upon panelling it out among
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards
about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them Ilefitn
Will Atkins, who was now grown a sober,
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed,
exceedingly pious and religious, and, as far I!
I may be allowed to speak positively in such a
case, I verily believe he was a true penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to
every one's sattsfsetion, that they only desired
one general writing under my band fix the
whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and
signed and sealed to than letting out the
bounds andsitnation of every man's plantation,
and testifying that I gave them thereby seve-
rallyaright to the wholopnaseasionandiahe-
ritanee of the respective plantations or farms,
with their improvements, to them and their
heirs, reserving all the restoftbe island as my
own property, and a certain rent for every

As to thegovernmentand laws amongthetn,
I told them I was noteapableot' giving then:
better rules than they were able to give their
selves; only Intade thorn promise me to live
in love and good neighbourhood withone ana-
tber; andaoIpreparedtoleave theta.
OnethingItntltnotornitnnd thatis, that
being now settled in a kind of canrnonwealth
among themselves, and having much business
in hand,itwasbutoddtobave aevenandthir-
ty Indians live in a nook of the island, inde-
pendent, and, indeed, unemployed; for, except-
ing the providing themselves food, which they
had difficulty enough to do sometimes, they had
no manner of business or properly to manage.
I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them, with Friday's
father, and to them to remove, and
either plant for themselves, or take them into
their several families as servants, to be main-
tained for their labour,but without being abso-
lute slaves; for I would not admit them to
make them slaves by force, by any means;
because they had their liberty given them by
capitulation, as it were articles of surrender,
which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the propow,
and came all v cheerful along with him: so
we allotted them land, and plantations, which
three or fiiur accepted of, but all the rest chose
to be employed as servants in the several
families we had settled; and thus my colony
was in a manner settled, as follows :---'I'he Spa-
niards possessed my original habitation, which
was the capital city, and extended their plan-
tations all along the side of the brook, which
made the creek that I have so otlen described,
as far as my bower; and as they increased
their culture, it went always eastward. The
English lived in the northeast part, where
lVill Atkins and his comrades began, and
came on southward and southwest, towards
the back part of the Spaniards; and every
plantation had a great addition of land to
take in, if they fitund occuion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of room.
All the east end of the island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the savages should come
on shore there only fix their usual customary
barbarities, they might come and go; if they
disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them:
tm-lno doubt but they were often ashore, and
went away again, for I never heard that the plan-
ters were ever attached or disturbed any mere.

It now came into my thoughts that I had
hinted to my friend the clergyman that the
work of converting the ravages might perhaps
be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction,
and told him that now I thought it was put in
a fair way; for the savages being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every

'one of them do their part with those which
came under their hands, I hoped it might have
a very good etl'ect. 13

He agreed presently inthat, iftheydid their
part. But how, says he, shall we obtain that
of thcni'l I told himwe would call them all
together, and leave it in charge with them, or
go to them. one by one, which he thought best:
so we divided it, he tospeak tn the Spaniards,
who were all papists, and I to the English.
whowere all protestants : and we recommended
it earnestly to them, and made them promise
that they would never make any distinctid of
papist or protestant in their exhorticg the sa-
vages to turn Christians, but teach them the
general knowledge of the true God. and of their
Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise pro-
mised us that they would never have any dif-
ferences or disputes one with another about
religion.

\VhenI came to \Vill Atkins's house, (I may

call it so, for such a house, or such a piece of
basket-work, I believe. was not standing in the
world again.) there I found the young woman
I have mentioned above, and Will Alkins's
wife, were become intimates; and this prudent,
religious young woman, had perfected the work
Will Atkins had begun; and though it was
not above four days alter what I have related,
yet the new-baptized savage woman was made
such a Christian asI have seldom heard of
in all my observation or conversation in the
world.
It came out into my mind, in the morning
before I went to them, that among all the
needful things I had to leave with them, I had
not let! them a Bible, in which I showed myself
less considering for them than my good friend
the widow was for me, when she sent me the
cargo of a hundred pounds from Lifion, where
she passed up three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a
greater extant than ever she imagined, for
they were reserved for the comfort and in-
struction ofthose that made much better two of
them than I had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and
when [came to Will Atkina's tent, or house,
and found the young wotnan and Atkins'sbap
tized wife had been discoursing of religion
together, for Will Atkins told it me with a
great dealof joy, I asked if they were together
now, and he said yes; so 1 wentintethehouss,
and he with me, and we found them together
very earnest in discourse. 0 air, says Will
Atkins, when God has sinners to reconcile to
himself, and aliens to bring home, he never
wants a messenger; my wife hasgota new
instructor; I knew I wasuunworthy as I was
incapable of that work; that voung woman
has been sent hither from beam: she is
enough to convert a whole island of savages.
The young woman blushed, and rose up to go
away, but [desired her tosit still; l told lter
she had a good work upon her hands, and I
hoped God would bless her in it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive
they had any book among them, though I did
notask: but I put my hand into my pocket,
atul pulled out my Bible; Here, says I to
Alkitet. I havo brought you an assistant that
pI rhapst voIt had not before. The man was so
cIutl'tmIIdetl that he "as not able to It peak for
some time; but recovering lIiIIIself, he!" takes it
with both his hands, and turning to his wife,
Here, my dear, says he, did not l tell you our
God, though ht: lives ahove, could hear what
we said? Heft: :t the book I prayed hit when
you and I kneeled doun under the bush; now
God has heard us, and 'st'nl it. When he had
said so, the man fell into such transpmts of
passionate joy, that. between the Joy of having
it, and giving (Sod thanks for it, the tears ran
down his fact: like a child that was crying.

The woman watt surprised, and was like to
have run intotI mistake that none of us were
aware of, for she lirmly believed God had sent
the book upon her husband's petition. It is
true, that pmvidcutially it was so, and might
be taken so in aamsetptent sense: but I W
lieve it would have been no diflieult matter, at
that time, to ltave persuaded the poor woman
to have believed that an express messenger
Came from heaven on purpose to bring that
individual book; but it was too serious a
matter to suffer any delusion to take place; so
I turned to the young woman, and told her we
did not desire to impose upon the new convert,
in her first and more ignorant undt'rstamling
of Ihtnns, and begged herw explain to her that
God may be very properly said to answer our
petitions, when, In the course of his provi-
dence. such things are in a particular manner
broughtto pass as we petitioned for; but we
did not expect returns from heaven in a mira-
culous and particular manner, and i! is our
mercy tltat it is notso.

This tho young woman did allerwarda
efi'cctually, so that there was, I assure you, no
priestcal'ttusd hare ; and I should have thought
it one oftho moat unjustifiable frauds in the
world to have had it so. But the surprise of
_on upon Will Atkins, is really not to be ex-
pressed: and there, we may be sure, was no
delusion. Sure no man was ever more thank-
ful in the world for any thingofits kind than
hewas for the Bible; nor. I kelieve, never
any man was glad of a Bible fritm a better

TIIIIa' It was with this poor man, however tattoo
rant he was of religion and Christian know-
ledge, he found he had some to do with now
more ignorant than himself, and that the least
part of the instruction ofhis good father that
now come to his mind was ofuse to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said,
how his father used to insist so much on the in-
expmssible value of the Bible, the privilege and
blessing of it to nations, families, and persom;
but he never entertained the least notion of the
worth of it till now, when being to talk to
ht'athetts, savages, and barbariatul, he wanted
the help of the written oracle for his asaistattce.
Thu young woman was glad of it also for the
present occasion, though she had one, and so
had tlte youth, on board our ship, among their
goods, which were not yet brought on shore.
And now having said so many things of this
young woman, I cannot. omit telling one story
more of her and myself, which has something
in it very infiming and remarkable.

l have related to what extremity the poor
young woman was reduced, how her mistress
was starved to death, and died on board that
unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole
ship's company was reduced to the last extre-
mity. Tho gentlewormn and her son, and this
maid, were first hardly used. as to provisions,
and at last totally neglected and starved tIhat is
to say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.--
One day, heingdiseoursing with her on the ex-
tremitiesthey sufl'ered, I asked her if shecould
describe, by what she had felt, what it was to
starve, and how It appeared? She told me she
believed she could, and she told her talo very
distinctly, thus .

First, sir, said she, we had for some days
fared exceeding hard, and sufl'ered very great
hunger: but at last we were wholly without
food ofany kind, except sugnmnd a little wine
and water. The first day,after I had received
no food at all. I found myself. towards evening,
first t'flli Ity and sick at the stntnm-h. and nearer
night witch inclined to yawning and sleep I
laiddown onecencbinthe greateahintn

a little relished, havingtaken a glans dwine
when I lay down: after being about three
hour: awalte, it beingabout five o'clock in the
morning, I found myeell' emptyand myria-
mach eicliiah, andlay down again, but could
notelccp at all, being very faint and ill; and
thus I continued all the second day, with a
etrange variety, but hungry, then aick again,
with reaching: to vomit. The eecuid night,
being obliged logo to bed again without any
food, more than n draught of fresh water, and
being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadofl,
and that the market was mightily atocked with
provisions; that I bought norm.- for my mietreae,
and went and dined very heartily. I thought
my stomach was aal'ullaller thia aa it would
have been alter a good dinneri but when I
awaited I was exceedingly limit in my Ipirill
to find in yull'inthe extremity offamine. The
last glmyofwine webadldranknndputntgar
in it, because of ita having eorne spirit to supply
nourishment; btit there being no aubetance in
the atomach for the digesting nice to work
upon, I found the only efl'ectof the wine waa
to raise d' ble fume- from the atomach
into the head; and I lay, u they told inc, etu-
pid and aenaeleea,aaone dntnh.foraome time.
The third day, in the morning, after a night of
strange, confused, and ineonsietent dreama, and
rather dozing thaneleeping, I nwaked ravenoua
and furious with hunger; and I queation, had
not my undentauding returned and conquered

had a little child with me,ita life would have

during which time I war twice raging mad aa

ter, who would not have taken it, but elie

his life.
Towards the morning I alept againgand
when I awoke, I fell into a violent passion of

Allthia nightIhad noeleep- butihe hun-

a terrible eolich and gr'ming, by wind, imead
of food, having found ita way into the bowele;
and in this condition I lay till morning, when!
was surprind with the take and lamentationa
of my young master, who called out to me
that his mother was dead; I liked myself up
a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found
she was not dead, thoughshe was able to give
very little signsof life.

I had then such convulsions in my stomach,
for want of some sustenance, that I cannot
describe; with such frequent throes and pangs
of appetito,.that nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate : and in this condition I was
when I heard the seamen above cry out, A
sail! a sail! and halloo and jump about as if
they were distracted.

. I was not able to gotoffrom the bed, and my

mistress .much less; and my young master was
so sick, thatI thought he had been expiring,
so we could not open the cabin door, or get
any account what it was that occasioned such
confusion; nor had we any conversation with
the ship's company for two days, they having
told us that they had not a mouthful of any
thing to eat in the ship; and this they told us
afterwards, they thought we had been dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were in when
you were sent tosave our lives: andhow you
foundus, sir, you know as wellas I, andbeuor
too.

This was her own relation, and is such
a distinct account of starving to death, as I
confess,I never met with, and was exceeding
entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to
believe it to be a true" account, because the
youthgave meanaccountofa goodpartofit;
though, I must own, not so distinct and so
feeling as the maid ; and the rather, because it
seems his mother fed him at the price of her
own life; but the poor maid, though her con-

that even, as their case stood, would have
served them buta little while, they being five
hundred leagues from any land, or any pom-

manner it happened: but this Is by the way;
I return to my disposition of things among the
people.

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for
many reasons I did not think fit to let them
know any thing of the sloop I had framed, and
which I thought of settIng up among them for
I found, at least at my first coming, such seeds
of divisions among them, that I saw plainly,
had I set up the sloop, and left it among them,
they would, upon every light disgust, have
separated, and gone away from one another,
or perhaps have tumsd pirates, and so made
the island a den of thIeves, Instead of a planta-

ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved
the sleep, therefore, and the guns for their

Having now done with the island, I left
them all in good circumstances and in a flou-
rishing condition, and went on board my ship
again the 6thol' May, having been about twenty-
fivo days among them; andas they were all re-
solved to stay upon the island tilllcame to
remove them, I promised to send them farther
relIef from the Brazils, if I could possibly find

an opportunity: and, particularly, I promised
to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs,
and cows; as to the two cows and calves
which I brought from England, we had been
obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill
them at sea, for want ofhay to feed them.

or island: we could not tell by any means.
But the third day y, towards evening, the sea

what it was, till after some time, ottr chief

pn-ssible grief, killed poor Fridaymoother man
being in their sight. The poor fellow was
shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more full very near him; such unlucky
marksmcn they were!

I was so enraged at the loss ofmy old trusty
servant and companion, that I immediately
ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot,
and four with great, and gave them such I
hmadside as they had never heard in their
ltvvs before, to be sure. They were not above
half a cable lcngthotl' when we tired; and our
gunners took their aim sou-ell that Ihreo or
fourof their cornice were overset, as we had
reason to believe, by one shot only.

The ill manners of turning: up their bare
backside: to us gave us no great otl'encc; nei-
ther did I know for certain whether that which
would pass for the greatest contempt among us
might be understood so by them or not :therclitre,
in return, I had only resolved to have fired four
or five guns at them with powder only, which
I knew would frighten them sufficiently: but
when they shot at us directly, with all the fury
they won capable of, and especially as they
had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely
lotcd and valued, and who, indeed, so well
deserved it, I thought myselfnot only justifiabloo
boll-re God and man, but would have been very
glad if I could have overset every canoe there,
and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor
how many we wounded, at this broadside, but
sure such a fright and hurry never was seen
among such a multitude ; there were thirteen or
fourteen of theircanoes split and overset in all,
and the men all set a swimming: the rest,
friohlt'ned out of their wits, scoured away as
fast as they could, taking but little care to save
those whose boats were split or spoiled with
our shot; so Isuppose that many of them were
lost; and our men took up one poor fellow
swimming for his life, above an hour after they
were all gone.

The small shot from our cannon must needs
Hllandwound a great many; but, in short,

we never knew anything how it went with
them, for they fled so fast, that' In three houn,
or Iltcrealtttttis, we could not see above three
or four strangling canoes, nor did we ever see
the rcstany more; for abreezeol' wind spring
ing up the same evenmg, we weighed, and set
sail for the Bruits.

\Ve had a prisoner, indecd,but the creature
was so sullen that he would neither eat nor
speak, and we all fancied he would starve him-
self to death: but I took a way to cure him;
for I made them take him and turn him into
the lonzhoat. and make him believe they would
toss him into the sea in, and so leave him,
where they found him, if he would not 3
norwouid that do, but they really did throw him
intothe sea, and came away from him; and
then he followed them, for he swam like a cork,
and called to them. In his tongue, though they
knew not one word of what he said: however,
at tut they took him in again, and then he
began to be more tractable; nor did I ever
design they should drown him.

\Ve were now under sail again; but I was
the most disconsolate creature aiive for want
of my man Friday, and would have been very
glad to have gone yback to the island to have
taken one of the rest from thence for my occa
sion; but it could not be; so we went on.
"N: had one prisoner, as I have said, and it
was n long time heflm: we could make him
understand any thing: but, in time, our men
taught him some English, and he began to be
a little tractable. Aflerwords, we inquired
what country he came from, but could make
nothing of what he said; for his speech was so
odd, all gutturals, and he spoke in the throat in
such a hollow, odd manner, that we could
never form a word alter him, and we were all

ofopinion that they might speak that language
as well it' they were gagged as olhcrwise- not-
could we perceive that they had any occasion
either Br teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but
formed their words, just as a hunting horn
forms atone, with an open throat. He told
us, however, some time afler, when we had
taught him to speak a little English, that they
were going with their kings to fight a great
battle. When he said kings, we asked him
how many kinws'l He said they were five In-

the governor, and get leavel'or me personally,
with the captain and one more. besides eight
seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and
this upon condition absolutely eepitulaled for,
that we should not offer to land any goods out

which was worthn- 'ltho rest. some nlIaterials
for planting sugarutmes with some p ants of
canes, which he,[ mean the Portugal man,
understood very weil.

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my
tenants in the island, I sent them by the sloop
three milch-eows and five calves, about twenty-
two hogs among them, three sows big with
pig, two mares, and n stonehorsu. For my
Spaniards. according to my prom", I engag-
ed three Portugal women to go, Ind recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use
them kindly. I could have procured more
women, but I remembered that the poor prose-
cuted man had two daughters, and that there
were but tive of the Spaniards that wanted:
the rest had wives of their own, though in
another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may
easily suppose, was very welcome to my old
inhabitants, who were now,wilh this addition,
between sixty and seventy IX'OPIU, 'uceideslittle
childrenmf which there were a great many.
I found letters at London from them all, by
way of Lisbon, when I came back to Lngltind,
of which I shall also take some notice imme-
diately.

I have now done with the island, and all
manner of discourse about it; and whoever
reads the rest of my memorandum: would do
well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and
expect to rendof the follies of on old man, n'ot

have titted her out again for otr supply; had
I done this, and stayed there myself. I had at
least acted like a man ofoornmon sense: but I
wu possessed with a wandering spirit, and
scorned all sdvantages: I pleased myself with
being the patron of the people I placed there,
and doing for them in a kind of haughty, Ina--
jestic way. like an old patriarchal monurch,
providing for them us if I had been father of
the whole lhmily, as well asof the plantation:
but I never so much as pretended to plant in
tho nameof any government or nation, or to
acknowledge any prince, or to call my people
subjects to any one nation more than another:
my, I never so much as gave the plane ammo,
but left it, as I found it, belonging to nobody,
and the people under no discipline or govern-
ment but my own; who, though I had influence
over them as a father end benefactor, had no
authority or power to actor command one way
or other, farther than voluntary consent moved
them' to comply: yet even this, had I stayed
there, would have done well enough; but as I
rambled from them, and came there no more,
the lost letters I had from any of them were by
my partner's Int-ans, who afterwards sent eno-
Ihvr sloop to the place, and who sent me word,
though I had not the letter till I got to London,
sen-ml years after it was written, that they
went on but poorly, were maleoontent with
their long stay there- that Will Atkins "as
dead: that live of-the Sp sninrds were come
away, and though they lied not been much
molested by the savages, yet they had had
some skirmishes with them; and that they
begged of him to write to me to think of the
promise had made to fetch them away, that
they might see their country again before they
died.

But I was gone n wildgoose chase, indeed!
and they that will have any more of we must be
content to followme into s new variety of follies,
hsrdships, and wild adventures, wherein the
justice of Providence may be duly observed;
and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge
us with our own desires, malts the strongest
of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us
most severely with those very things which we
think it would be our utmost happiness to be
allowed in. Whether I hnd business who bu-
siness, away I went: it isno time now to en-
large upon the tenson or absurdity of my own
conduct, but to come to the history; I was
embarked for the voyage, and the voyage I
went.

I shall only add aword or two concerning my
honest popish clergyman ; for let their opinion

believe this man war very sincere, and wivhed
the good ofall men: yet I believe hewaa upon
the reserve in many of his entree-ions, to pre-

once call on the bloomed Virgin, or mention St.
Iago or his guardian angel, though so common
with the rest of them: however, I say, I had
not the least doubt of his sineerttv and pious in-
tentions on his own part; and I am firmly of
opinion, it'the rest ofthe popish mieaiooariu

weapons, and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening when we went on
there, that a greater number of their people
came down than usual,but allvery friendly and
civil; and they brought several kinds of provi-
aims, for which we satisfied them with such
toys as we had; their women also brought as
milk and roots, and several things very accept-
able to us, and all was quiet: and we made us
a little tent or hut of some boughs of trees, and
lay on shore all night.

I know not what was the occaxiun, but I
was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the
rest: and the boat riding at an anchor about
a stone's east from the land, with two men in
her to take care of her, I made one of them
come on shore; and getting some bottglts of
trees to cover as also in the boat, I spread the
nail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under
the cover of the branehea of the treesall night
in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard
one of our men make a. terrible noise on the
shore, calling out, for God's sake, to bring the
boat in, and come and help them, forthey "'ch
all like to be murdered; at the same time I
heard the lire of five rmtsltcts, which was the
numberof the guns they had, and that three
times ot'er; for, it seems, the natives here
were not so easily frightened with guns as the
savages were in America, where I had to do
with thetn. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from
sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be
thmt in, and resolved, with three times
we had on board, to [and and assist our
men.

We got the boat noon to the there, but our
men were in too much haste ; for being come
.0 the shore, they plunged into the water, to
get to the boat with all the expedition they
could, being pursued by between threeand four
hundred men. Our men were but nine in all,
aadonly fire of them had tunes with them -, the

reathad piatolaandlworda, indeed, btttthey
were ofornall use to theta.

We took up seven of our men, and with
dificulty enough too, three of them being very
ill wounded; and that which was still worse
was, that while we stood in the boat to take
our men in, we were in as much danger an
they were in onshore; toe-they potn'cd their
arrows in upon us so thick, that we were glad
to barricade the side of the boat up with the
benches, and two or three lot-e boards, which
to ottr great satisfietion,we had by mere accio
dent in the boat. And yet, had it been day-
light, they are, it seems, auch exact marksman,
that if they could have seen but the least part
of any of us, they would have been aure ofus.
We had, by the light of the moon, alittle sight
ofthem, as they stood pelting In from the shore
with darts and arrows: and having got ready
our firearms, we gave them a volley, that we
could hear, by the cries of some of them, had
wounded several ; however, they stood thus in
battle array on the shore till break of day,
which we lemme was that they might see the
better to take their aim at us.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell
how to weigh our anchor or set up our sail, be-
catwe we must needs stand up in the boat,
and they were as sure to hit us as we were to
hit a bird in a tree with small shot. "In made
signals of distress to the ship, which though
she rode a league off, yet my nephew the cap-
tain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perb
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired
towards the shore, pretty well understood us;
and weighing anchor with all speed, he stood
as near the shore as he durat with the ship,
and then sent another boat, with ten hands in
her. to usist us : but we called to them not to
come too near, telling them what condition we
were in : however they Itood in near to us, nnd
one of the men taking the end ofa tow-line in
his hand, and keeping one. boat between him
and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the
line to the boat : upon which we slipped out a
little cable, and leaving our anchor behind,
they towed us out of the reach of the. arrow: 3
we all the while lying close behind the barricado
we had made.

As soon as we were from between the
whip and the shore, that we could lay her side
to the shore. she ntn along just by them, and
poured in abroadside among them loaded with
pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such
stuff, besides the great shot, which made a
terrible havoc among them.

"'benwe were goton board andomofdao-
gar, we had time to examine into the occasion
of this fray; and, indeed, our supercargo,
who had been often in those parts, put me upon
it; for he said he was sure the inhabitants
would not have touched us alter we had made
a truce, if we had not done something to pro-
voke them to it. At length it came out that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some
milk, had brought it within our poles, and a
young woman with her, who also brought some
roots or herbs; and while the old woman
(whether she was mother to the young woman
erno they could not tell wasselling us the milk,
one of our men olfere some rudeness to the
wench that was with her, at which the old
woman made a great noise: however, the sea-
'man would not quit his prize, but '_ed her
out of the old woman's sight a '

away with ' , and, as we: '
made an outcry among the peop
from; who, upon notice, raised mn' ' army
upon us in three or four hours ,. and it was
great odds but we had all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance
thrown at him just at the beginnihg of the
attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had
made: the restcameofi' free, all but the fellow
' who was the occasion of all the mischief, who
paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we
could not hear what became of him a great
while. We lay upon the shore two days afler,
though the 'wind presented, and made signals
or him, and made our boat sail up shore and
down shore several leagues, but in vain, so we
were obliged to give him over; and ifhe alone
had suffered lbr it, the loss had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without
venturing on shore once more, totry if I could
learn any thing of him or them: it was the
third night after the action that I had a great
mind toleam, if I cotlld by any means, what
mischief we had done, and how the game stood
on the Indians' side. I wascareful to do it in
the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the
men I went with had been under my command,
before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and
mischievous as I was brought into by it, with-
out design.

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as
any in the ship, besides the supercargo and
myselfland we landed two hours before mid-
night, at the same pldw where the Indians
stood drawn up in the evening before ; I landed
here. because my design, as I have said, was
chiefly to see if they had quitted the field,'and
ifthey had left any marks behind them of the

    
 
 
  
   
 

o

203
mischief we had done them; and I thought if
we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps
we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided
our men into two bodies, whereof the boat-
swain commanded one, and I the other. We
neither saw nor heard any body stir when we
landed: and we marched up, one body at a
distance from the other, to the place; Inn at
first could see nothing, it being very dark; till
by and by our boatswnin, who led the first
party, stumbled and fell over a dead body.
This made them belt awhile; for knowim by
the circumstances that they were at the place
where the Indians had'stood, they waited lbr
my coming up there. We concluded tohalt till
the moon began to rise, which we knew would
in less than an hour, when we could easily
iscem the havoc we had made among them.
We told thirty-two bodies upon the ground,
whereoftwo were not quite dead; some had
an arm, and some aleg shot off, and one his
head; those that were wounded, we suppose,
they had carried away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full
discovery of all we could come to the know-
ledge of, I was resolved for going on board;
but the boatswain and his party sent me word
that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called
them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with
them; and if they could find them, as they slill
fancied they should, they did not doubt of
getting a good booty; and it might be they
might find Torn Jefl'ry there; that was the
man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew
well enough what answer to have given them,
forI should have commanded them instantly
on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for
us to run. who had a ship, and ship-loading in
our charge, and a voyage to make which de-
pended very much upon the lives of the men;
but as they sentme word they were resolved
to go, and only asked me and my company
to go along with them, I positively refused it,
and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground,
in order to go to the boat. One or two of the
men began to importune me to go; and when
I refused, began to grumble, and say that they
were not. under my command, and they would
go. Come, Jack, says one of the men, will
you go with me? I'll go for one. Jack said he
would,--and then another,--and in a word, they
all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay,
and a boy left in the boat. So the supercarge
andI,with the third man, went backto the
best, where we told them we would stay for
them, and take care to take in as many of
them as should be let); lbrI told them itwas a
mad thing they were goingabout,a supposed
most of them would run the fate of cm Jeffry.

They told me, like seamen, they would
warrant it they would come otf again, and they
would take care, &c.; an away they went. I
entreated them to consider the ship and the
voyage, that their lives were not their own, and
that they were intrusted with the voyage, in
some measure; that if they miscarried, the
ship might belost for want of their help, and
that they could not answer for it to God or
man. But I might as well have talked to tho
mainmast of the ship; they were mad upon
their journey, only they gave me good words,
and begged I would not bo angry; that they
did not doubt but they would be back again i
aboutan hour at farthest; for the Indian town
they said, was notabove half amile 05', though
they found it above two..miles before they got
to it.

Well, they all went away; and though the
attempt>> was desperate, and such as none but
madman would have gone about, yet, to give
them their due, they went about it as warily
as boldly: they were gallantly armed, for they

ad every man afuseo or musket, a bayonet,
and a pistol; some of them had broad outlas-
ses, some of them had hangers, and the boat}-
awain and two more had poleaxes; besides all
which, they had among them thirteen hand-
grenadoes: bolder fellows and better provided,
never went about any wicked work in the
'world.

When they went out, their chief design was
plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of
finding gold there; but a circumstance, which
none of them were aware of, set them on fire
with revenge, and made devils of them all.
When they came to the few Indian houses
which they thought had been the town, which
wasnot above half a mile olf, they were under
a great disappointment, for there were not
above twelve or thirteen houses; and where
the town was, or how big, they knew not.
They consulted, therefore, what to do, and
were some time before they could resolve; for
if they fell upon these, they must cut g" their
throats, and it was lento one but someof them
might escape, it being in the night, though the
moon was up; and if one escaped, he would
run and raise all the town, so they should have
a whole army upon them: again, on the other
hand, if they went away and left those un-
touched, for the people _were all asleep, thhy
could not tell which way who} for the town;

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

however, the last was the best advice; so they
resolved to leave them, and look for the town
as well as they could. They went on a little
way, and lbund a cow tied to a tree; this,
they presently concluded, would be a good
guide to them; for, they said, the cow cer.
tainly belonged to the town before them, or to
the town behind them; and if they untied her,
they shouid see which way she went; if she
went back, they had nothing to say to her

but, if she went forward, they would follow '

her: so they cut the cord, which was made of

' twisted flags, and the cow went on before them,
directly to the town; which, as they reported,
consisted of above two hundred houses or huts,
and in some of these they found several fami-
lies living together.

and see what dimensions-it was of, and if they
might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that
they would venture upon them: but while they
were animating one another tothe work, three
of them, who were a little before the ram, called
out aloud to them, and told them that they had
found Tom Jcfl'ry: they all ran up to the place
where they found the poor fellow hanging up
naked by one arm, and his throat out. There
was an Indian house just by the tree, where
they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indiars, who had been concerned in the fray

with us before, and two or three of them'
wounded with our shot; and our man found '

should have any quarter; and to work they
went immediately, and yet not so madly as
might be expected from the rage and fury they
were in. Their first care was to get some-
thing thatwould soop take fire, but, after a
little search, they found that would be to no
purpose; for most of the houses were low, and
thatched with flags and rushes, of which the

wildfire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder
in the palm of their handsi and in aquarler of
an hour they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and particularly that house where the
gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor

frightened creatures began to rush out to save

their lives, but met with their fate in the
attempt; and especially at the door, where
they drove them back, the boatswain himself
killing one or two with his poleaxe; the house
being large, and many in it, he did not care to
go in, but called for a hand grenade, and threw
itamong them, which at first frightened them,
but, when it burst, made such havoc among
them, that they cried out in a hideous manner.

kept, with their bayonets on the u
their pieces, and despatched all that >>. 'e in
their way: but there was another apartment in
the house, where the prince or king, or whatever
he was, and several others were; and these were
kept in till the house, which was by this time
all in a. light fiame, fell in upon them, and they
were smothered together.

All this while they fired not a gun, because

> they would not waken' the people faster than

they could master them, but the fire began to
woken them fast enough, and our fellows were
glad to keep a little together in bodies; for the
fire grew so raging, all the houses being made
of light combustible stuff, that they could hardly
bear the street between them, and their busi-
ness was to follow the fire, for the surer execu-
tion : as fastasthe fire either forced the people
out of these houses which were burning, or
frightened them out of others, our people were
ready at their doors to knock them on the head,
still calling and hallooing oneto another to re-
'mamber Tom Jefi'ry.

While this was doin , I must confess I was
very uneasy, and y when I saw_ the
flames of the town, ovifiich, it being night,
seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the

captain, who was mused by his men, seeing.

such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what
the matter was, or what danger! was In, espe-
cially hearing the guns too, for by this time
they began to use their firearms; a'thousand
thoughts opprmed his mind concerning me and
the supercargo, what would become of us :, and,
atlast, though he could ill spareanymore men,
yet not knowing what exigen'ce we might be m,

He was surprised to see me and the super-
cargo in the boat, with no more than two men;
and though he was glad that we were well, yet.
be was in the same impatience with us to know
what was doing; for the noise continued, and
the flame increased ; in short, it was next to an
imposibility for any man in the world to restrain
their curiosity to know what had happened, or
their concern for tho safety-of the men : in a
word, the captaintold me he would go and help
his men, let what would come. I argued with
him, as I did before with themen, the safety of
the ship, the dangerof the voyage, the interest
of the owners and merchants, Ste. and told him
I and the two men would go, and only see if we
could at a distance learn what was like to be the

. event, and come back and tell him. It was all
. no to talk to my nephew, as it wasto talk to the
--. -t beibre; he would go, he said; and he only

-' ed he hadleftbut ten menin the ship; for
he could not think of having his men lost lbr
want of help; he had ratherlose the ship, the
voyage, and his lifeand all; and away hcwent.

I was no more abletostay behind now than
I was to persuade them not to go; so, in short,
the captain ordered two men to row back the
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the
longboat at an anchor; and that when they
came back, six men should keep the two boats,
and six more come after us ; so that he left only
sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's
company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof
two were lost in the late quarrel which brought
this mischief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure
we felt little ofthe ground we trodon ; and being
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went
directly to the place of the flame. Ifthe noise
of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries
of the poor people were now quite of another na--
ture, and filled us with horror. I must confess
I was never at the saddng a city, or at the taking
a' town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Crom-
welltaking in Ireland, and killing
man, woman, and child; and I had read of
Count-Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg,
and Hitting the throats of twenty-two thousand
of all sexes; but I never had an idea of the
thing itself before, nor is it possible to describe
it, or the horror that was upon our minds at
hearing it. However, we went on, and at
length came to the town, th there was no
entering the streets of it for the fire. The first
object we met withwas the ruins of a hut or
house, or rather the ashes ofit, for the house
was consumed; and just before it, plain enough
to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men
and three woman killed, and, as we thought.
one or two more lay in the heap among the tire;
in short, there were such instances of rage alto-
gether barbarous, and of a fury something be-
yond what was human, that we thought it im<
possible our men could be guilty of it; or if they
were the authors of it, we thought they ought
to be every one of them put to the worst of
deaths.

But this was not all: we saw the fire increa-
sed forward, and the crywent on just as the tire
wenton; so that. we were in the utmost confu-
sion. We advanced a little way farther ; and,
behold, to our astonishment, three naked women,
and crying in a most dreadful manner, came
flying as if they had wings, and after them six-
teen or seventeen men, natives, in the same
terror and consternation, with three of our Eng-
lish butchers in the rear; who, when they could
not overtake them, fired in among them, an
one that was killed by their shot fell down in on
sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to
be their enemies, and that we would murder
themas well as those that pursued them, they
set up a moat dreadful shriek, especially the
women, and two of them fell down, as if already
dead, with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my
blood ran chill in_ my veins,.when I saw this:
and I believe, had the three English sailors that
pursued them come on, I had made our men kill
them all: however, we took some ways to let
the poor flying creatures know that we would not
hurt them ; and immediately they came up to us,
and kneeling down with their hands lifted up,
made piteous lamentation tous to save them,
which we let them know we would ; whereupon
they crept all together in a huddle close behind
us, as tbr protection. I left my men drawn up
together, and charging them to hurt nobody, but
if possible, to get at. some of our lo, and see
what devil it was possessed them: and what they
intended to do, and to command them off; as-
suring them that if they stayed till daylight,
they would have a hundred thousand men about
their ears: I say, Ileit them, and went among
those flying people, taking only two of our men
with me; and there was indeed a piteoua spec-
tacle among them; some of them had their feet
terribly burned, with trampling and running
through the fire, others their hands burned ; one
of the women had fallen down in the fire, and
was very much burned before she could get out
again; andtwo orthree ofthe men had cuts in
their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing;
and another was shot through the body, and
died while I was there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion
of all this was, but I could not understand one

 
  
   
 

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

word they said; though by signs, I perceivee
some of them knew not what was the occasion
themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts-
at this outrageous attempt, that I could not
stay there, but went back to my own men, and
resolved to go into the middle of the town,
through the fire, or whatever might be in the
way, and put an end to it, cost what it would:
accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told
them my resolution, and commanded them to
follow me ; when at the very moment came [bur
of our men, with the boatswein at their head,
roving over heaps of bodies they had killed, all
covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted
more people to massacre, whenour men hallooed
to them as loud as they could holloo; and with
muc ado one of them made them hear, so
knew who we were, and catne up
? Q

. the boatswainmus, he set up

0 a. shout of triumph, for having, as
he thought, more help come; and without
waiting to hear me, Captain, says he, noble
captain! I am glad you are come; we are not
halftime yet: villanous hell-hound dogs! I'll
killas manyof them as poor Tom has hairs
upon his head: ,we have sworn to spare none
of them; we'll root out the very nation of them
fiorn the earth: and thus he ran on, out of
breath too with action, and would not give us
leave to speak a word.

At last, raising my voice,that I might silence
him a little, Barbarous dog! said I, what are
you doing? I won't have one creature touched
more, upon pain of death: I charge you, upon
your life, to stop your hands, and stand still
here, or you are a dead man this minute.--
Why, air, says he, do you know what you do,
or what they have done '1 If you want a reason
for what we have done, come hitlter ; and with
that he showed me the poor fellow hanging,
with his throat out.

I confess I was urged then myself, and at
another time would have been forward enough ;
butI thought they had carried their rage too
far, and remembered Jacob's words to his sons
Simeonand Levi--"Cursed be their anger,
for itwas fierce; and their wrath, for it was
cruel." But I had now a new task upon my
hands: for when the men I carried with me
saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much
todo to restrain them as I should have had
with theothers; nay, my nephew himself fell
in with them, and told me, in their hearing,
that he was only concerned for fear of the men
being overpowered; and as to the people, he
thought not one of them ought to live; for they

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia,
and from thence to the coast of Coromandel,
only to touch at Surat: but the chief of the
supercargo' I design lay at the bay of Bengal, -
where if he missed his business outward-bound,
hewaslngo up to China, and return to the
coast as he came

The first disaster that befall us was in the
gulf of Persia, where fiveof our men venturing
on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf, were
sun'ounded by the Arabians, and either all
killed or carried away into slavery ; the rest
of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them,
and had but just time to get ofi'their boat. I
began to Itphraid them with the just retribution
of Heaven in this case : but the boatswain very
warmly told me, he thought I went lhrther in
my censure: than I could show any warrant
for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii.
4, where our Saviour intimates that those men
on whom the tntverofSiloam fell were not sin-
nera above all the Galileans; but that which
put me to silence in the case was, that not one
of these five men who were now lost were of
those who went on shore to the massacre of
Madagascar, so I always called it, though our
men could not hear to hear the word mm
with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on the
subject had worse consequences than I expect-
ed ; and theboatswatn, who had been the head
of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time
and told me he found that I brought that affair
continually upon the stage; thaII made unjust
reflections upon it, and had used the men very
ill on that account, and himself in particular;
thataaIwasbut up passenger, andhadnooorn-
mend In the ship, or concern in the voyage,
they were not ohliaed to hear it , that they
didnot ltnow but I might have some ill desian
in my head, and perhaps to call them to an ac-
count for it when they came to England; and
that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have
done with it, and also not to concern myself
any further with him, or any of his afi'airs, he
would leave the ship; for he did not think it
was safe to sail with me among them.

I heardhim patiently enough till he had done,
and then told him, that I confessed I had all
along opposed the massacre of Madagascar,
and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my
mind freely about it, though not more upon
him than any of the rest; that as to having no
command in lheahip, that was true: nor did I

exercise any authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly
concernedusall; and what concern Ihadin
the voyage was noneefhis business: that I
was a outsiderable owner in the ship 3 in that
claim, I conceived [had a right tospeak even
farther than Ihad done, and would not be an-
countable tohim or any one else; and began
to be a little warm with hint. He made but
little reply to me at that time, and I thought
the affair had been over. We were at this
time in the road at Bengal: and being willing
to see the place, I went on shore with the au-
percargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself ;
and towards evening was preparing to go on
board, when one oftho men came to me, and
told me he would not have me trouble myself
to eomedown tn the boat, for they had orders
nottocarrymeon boardanymore. Anyone
mayguesewhata surprise! was inatsoineo-
lent a andl asked the man, who
bade him deliverthat message to me? He told
me, the cocltswain. I said nomore to the fel-
low, but bade him let them know he had deli-
vered his message, and that I had given hint
no answer to it.

I immediately went and found out the super-
nargo, and told him the story ; adding what I
presently fixeoaw, that there would be a mutiny
in the ship; and cntreated him to go immedi-
ately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and
acquaint the captain of it. But I might have
spared this intelligence, for before I had spoken
to him on shore the matter was efi'ected on
board. The boatswain. the gunner, the cart-
penter, and all the inferior oflieets, as soon as
I was gone off in the boat, came up, and
desired to speak with the captain; and there
the boatawain, making along h , and
repeating 'all he had said to mo, told the
captain, in a few words, that as I was now
gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to
use any violence with me, which, if! had not
gone on shore, they would otherwise have
done, to oblige me to have gone; they there-
fore thought lit to tell him, that as they shipped
themselves to serve in the ship under his com-
mand they would perform It well and faithfully- ,
but in would not quit the ship, orthc captain

ship p, and sail no farther with him: and at that
word all, he turned his face toward the main-
mast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed
on between them, at which all the seamen.
being got together there, cried out, One and
all. ' one and all. '

My nephew, the captain, wasa man of spirit.
andof great,preeenceofmind; and thoughhe
wunrrprlsed, you may he sure, atthothing,
yet he told them calmly that he would consider
ofthe matter; hutthathecould donothing in
it till he had spoken to me about it. He used
some arguments withthem to showthemthe
unreasonableneas and injustice of the thing:
butit was allinvain: theyswore, and shook
hands round before his face, that they would

'f'hiswas a hard article nponhim, who knew
his obligation to me, and did not ltnow how
I might take it: so he began to tallumartly to
them; told them that Iwas a very considerable
owner of the ship, and that, in justice. he could
not putme outofnty ownhouee; thatthiawas
next door to serving me astho famous pirate
Kidd had done, who made amutiny in the ship,
set the captain on shore on an uninhabited
island,and ran away with the ship; thatlet them
go into what ship they would, if ever they came
to England again it would cost them very dear;
that the ship was mine, and that he could not
put me out of it; and that he would rather lose
tho ship and the voyage too than disohlige me
so much 3 so they might do as they pleased :
however, he would go on shore and talk with
me, and invited the boatswoin to go with him,
and perhaps they might accommodate the
matter with mo. But they all rejected the
proposal, and said they would have nothing to

captain, if you are all of this mind, let me go

that they would confine him by violence, set
sail, and run away with the ship; and then
I had been stripped naked in a remote country,
having nothing to help myself; in short, I had
beenina worsocasethan whenlwaa alone

length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and when
my nephew told me what they had said to him,
and how they had sworn and shook hands that

suffered to come on board, I told him he should
not be concerned at it at all,for I would stayon

send me all my necessary things onshore, and
leave me a sufficient sumof money,and I would
find my way to England as well ad could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my
nephew, hutthere was noway to help it but to

ship again, and satisfied the men that hisunels

for his goodsfrorn on board the ship: so that
the matter was over in a few hours, tlternen

Iwasnowaloneinthemostmote partof
the world, asI think I may call it, for Iwas
near three thousand leagues by sea farther of
from England than! was at my island; only,
it is true, I might travel here by land over the
great MW's country to Surat, might go from
thence toBassorahy sea, up the gulf ofPersia,
and take the way of the caravans, over the Do-
sert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Sanderoon; from
thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland
into France; and this put together might at
least be a full diameter of the globe or more.

I had another way before me, which was to

was next door to it, both ways; however, my
nephew left me two servants, or rather one oom-
panion and one servant : the first was clerk to
the purser, whom he engaged to go with me,
and the other was his own servant. I look me
also a good lodging in the house of an English-
woman, where several merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one
Englishman; hero I was handsomely enough
entertained: and thatI might not be said to
run rashly upon any thing, i stayed here above
nine months considering what. course to talte,
and how to manage myself. 1 had some Eng'
Iish gmds with me of value, and a considerable
sum ofmoney ; my nephew furnishing me with
a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit
for more, if 1 had occuion, that I might not be
straitened, whatever might happen.

1 quickly disposed of my goods to advantage,
and, as l originally intended, I bought heresomo
very good diamonds, which, of all other things,
were the most proper for me, in my present
circumstances; because I could always carry
my whole estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals
made for my return to England, but none fall-
ing out to my mind, the English merchant who
lodged with me, and whomI had contracted
an intimate acquaintance with, came to me
one morning. Countrytnan, says he, I have a
project to communicate to you, which, as it
suits withmy thoughts, may, for aughtl know,
suit with yours also, when you shall have tho-
roughly oonsidered it. Here we are posted,
you by accident, and l by my own choice, in a
part of the world very remote from our own
country; but it is in a country where, by us
who understand trade and business, agreat deal
ofmoney is to be got. "you will put one thou-
sand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we
will hire a ship here, the first item get to our
minds; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant,
and we'll go a trading voyage to China: for
what should we stand still for? The whole
world is in motion, rolling round and round;
all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and
earthly, are busy and diligent ; why should we
be idle? There are no drones in the world
but men; why should we be of that num-
ber'!

I liked this proposal very well, and the more
because it seemed to be expressed with so much
good will, and in so friendly a manner. I will
not say but that I might, by my loose unhinged
circumstances, be the filter to embrace a pro-
posal for trade, or indeed any thing else;
whereas, otherwise, trade Was none of my
0'0an However, I might perhaps say with

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

some truth, that if trade was not my element,
rambling was, and no pmposal for seeing any
part of the world which I had never seen
before could poaibly come amiss to me.

It was, however, sometime before we could
get a ship to our minds, and when we had got.
a vessel, it was not easy toget English sailors;
that is to say, so many as were necessary to
govern the voyage and the sailors
which we should pick up there. After some
time we got amate, aboatswain, and a gunner,
English; a Dutch ntcr, and three fore-
mastmen. With these we found we could do
well enough, having Indian seamen, such as
they were, to malte up.

There are so many travellers who have
wrote the history of their voyages and travels
this way, that it would be very little diversion
to any body to give a long account of the places
we went to, and the people who inhabit there ,
tlteso things I leave to others, and refer the
reader to those journals and travels of English-
men of which many I find are published and
more promised every day: it is enough tor me
to tell you that we made this voyage to Achin, in
the island of Sumatra, and from hence to Siam,
where we exchanged some of our wares for
opium and some arrach ; the first aoommodity
which brats a great price among the Chinese,
and which, at that time, was much wanted
there. In a word, we went up to Suslzan,
made a very great voyage, were eight maths
out, and returned to Bengal: and l was very
well satisfied with my adventure. I observe
that our people in Engl often admire him
oflicers which the Comps y send into India,
and the merchants which generally stay there,
get such very great estates as they do, and
sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy
thousand pounds at a time : but it is no won-
der, or at least we shall seeso much farther
into it, when we consider the innumerable port.
and places where they hfie a free commerce,
that it will be none ; and much less it will be
so when we consider that at those places and
ports where the English ships come, there is
such great and constant demands for the growth
of all other countries, that there is a certain
vent for the returns, as well as amorltet abroad
for the goods carried out.

In short we made a verygood voyage, and
I got somuch money by my first adventure,
and such an insight into the method of getti
more that had I been twenty years younger?'
should have been tempted to have stayed here,
and sought no farther lbr making any fortune;
but what was all this to a man upwards d
dirececuo, that was rich enough, and cans
abroad moreinohedience toarestleesdesire
of seeing the world than a covetous desire of
gaining by it I And, indeed, I think it is
with great justice hwwcall it reetle- desire,

forit was so. When Iwas at home, I was
restless to go abroad; and when I was
aimed, I was restless tobeathome. I say,
what was this gain to Ine'.l I was rich enough
already, nor had I any uneasy desires about
gettine more money; and therefore the profit
of theruy yage to mewasof nogreat force
for the prornp pting me forward to t'artherunderh
takings; hence I thought that by this voyage
Ihad mndeno atall,becauselwas
come back, as I might call it, to the placel'rom
whence l came,a.r to a borne: whereas my eye,
which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was
ncv'ler satisfied with seeing, was still desirous
of wandering Inducing more. I was oorne
into a of the world which I was never in
before, and that part, in particular, which I
hadheardmuchofiand was resolvedto seeas
muchot'it asIeould; and then IthoughtI
might say Ihad seen all the world that was
worth seeing. _

But my fellow traveller and 1 had difi'erent
notions: [do not name this to imist on my
own, for I acknowledge his were the must
just, and the most suited to the end ofa men-
chant's life : who, when he is abroad upon
adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that,
as the best thing for him, which he is like to
get the most money by. My new friend kept
himsell'to the list of the thing, and would
have been content have gone like acarrier's
horse, always to the same inn, backward and
forward, provided he could, as he called it, find
his aceountin it. On theotherhand, mine was
the notion of a mad rambling boy, that never
cares to see a thing twice over. But this was
not all: I had a kind ot'impatience upon me
to be nearer hornefind yet the most unsettled
resolution imaginable which way logo. In the

five months. We sold our spice, which was
chiefly cloves and some nutmege, to the Per>>
lian merchants, who carried them away to the
gulf: and making near fiveol' one, we really
got a great deal ofrooney y.

Nothinghsd so IIIIIch trediled me a pod

going with them; for sucha ramble, I thought,
and in such company as would both have
_'tartlcd and diverted me, would have suited
ily with my great design; and I should
hate lrttllr seen the world and gone homewards
too: but I was tnuch better satisfied at'ew days
after, "In-n I came to know what sort offellowa
they were; for, in short, their history was,
that this than tltey called captain was the gun-
tier only, not the commander; that they had
been a trading voyage, in which they had been
attached on short: by some of the Malays, who
had killed the captain and three of his men:
and that afier tlte captain was killed, these
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run
away with the ship, which they did, and brought
her to Bengal, leaving the mate and live men
more on shore; of whom hereafter.

"'ell, let them get the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, a: we thought, though
we did not, I confess, examine into things so
exactly as we ought; for we never tnquired any
thing oftht- seamen, who \vuuld certainly have
{altered in their account, contradicted one ano-
ther, and perhaps contradicted themselves; or
one how or other we should have had reason
tohavo suspected them; but the man showed
us a bill of sale lbr the ship, to one Emanuel
Clostershoven, or some such name, for I stip-
posc it was all a forgery. and called himself by
that name. and we could nutcontradiet him;
and withal having no suspicion of the thing, we
went through With our bargain.

"'0 picked up some more English sailors
here aller tltis, and some Dutch; and now we
resolved for a second voyage to the southeast
for cloves, &c. thht is to say among the Phi-
lippine and Molueca isles; and, in short, not
to fill up this part of my story With trifics, when
what is to come is so remarkable, I spent,from
first to last, six years inrthis country, trading
from part to port, backward and forward, and
with very good success, and was now the last
year with my new partner, going in the ship
above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but
designing first to Siam, to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds
obliged to beat up and down a great while in
the straits of Malacca, and among the islands,
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult
seas than we found our ship had sprung a leak,
and we were not. able, by all our industry, to
find out where it was. This forced usto make
some port; and my partner, who knew the
country better than I did, directed the captain
to put into the river of Cambodia: for I had

of the ship upon myself. This river lies on
the north side of the great bay orgull' which
goes up to Siam. While we were here, and
going often on shore for refreshment, there
comes to me one day an Englishman, and he
Was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an
English East India ship which rode in the
same river, at or near the city of Cambodia;
what brought him hither we knew not; but he
comes to me, and speaking English, Sir, says
he, you are a stranger to me, and I to you. but
I have something to tell you that very nearly
concerns you.

I looked steadfastly at him a good while,
and thought at first I had known hitn, but I did
not: If it very nearlyconcems me, said I, atrd
not yourself, what moves you to tell it to me'!
--I am meted, says he, by the imminent dan-
ger you are in, and, for ought I See, you have
no knowledge of it.--I know no danger I am
in, says I, but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but Iintcnd to lay her

But, sir, says he. leaky or not leaky, find it or
not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your
ship on shore to-nrorrrow, whcnyott hear what
I have to say to you: do you know, sir, said
he, the town of Cambodia lies about fdlcen
leagues up this river? and there are ttvolarge
English ships about five leagues on this side,
and three Dutch.----Well, said I. and what is
that to me i--Why. sir, said he, is it fit- a man
that is upon such adventures as you are, to
come intoa port and not examine first what
ships there are there, and whether he is able
to deal with them? I suppose you do not think
you are atnatch for them? I was amused very
much at his discourse, but not amazed at it,
for I could not conceive what he meant; and I
turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish
you would explain yourself: I cannot imagine
what reason i have to be afivaid of any of the
Company's ships, or Dutch ships: I am no
interloper; what can they have to say to me '!
He looked like a man half angry and half
pleased, and pausing awhile, but smiling, Well
sir, says be, if you think youself secure, you
must take your chance; I am sorry your fate
ahould blind you against good advice; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea imme-
diately, you will the very next tide be attacked
by five longboals full of men, and perhaps, if
you are taken, you will be hanged fora pirate,
and the particulars be examined afterwards. I

a better reception than this, for doing you a
piece of service of such irnportance.--l ean

to any man that offer! me any kindness; but it
is past my comprehension what they should
have such a design upon me for: however,
since you say there is no time to be lost, and
that there is some villanous design on hand
against me,I will go on hoard this minute,
and put to sea immediately, if my men can
stop the leak, or if we can swim without stop-

rant of the cause of all this? Can you give tne
no further light into it ?--I can tell you but
part of the story, sir, says he: but I have a
Dutch seamen hero with me, and I believe I
could persuade him to tell you the rest; but
there is scarce time for it: but the short of the
story is this, the first part of which, Isuppose,
you know well enough, viz. that you was with
this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain
was murdered by the Malays, with three of
his men; and that you, or some of those that
were on board with you, ran away with the
ship, and are since turned pirates. T his' is the
sum ofthe nory, and you will all be seized as
pirates,I can assure you, and executed with
very little ceremony: for you know merchant
ships show but little law to pirates, if they get
them into their wen--Now you speak plain
English, said I, and I thank you , and though
lkttow nothingthat we have done like what
you talk of, for I am sure we came honestly
and fairly by the ship ; yet seeing such a work
is doing, as you say, and that you seem to
mean honestly, I will be upon my guard.--
Nay, sir, says he, do not talk of being upon
your ; the host defence is, to be out of
the danger; if you have any regard for your
life, and the lives of all your men, put to sea,
without fail, at high water; and as you have a
whole tide before you, you will be gone too far
out before they can come down; for they will
come away at high water, and as they have
twenty miles to come, on will get near two
hours of them by the dili'erence of the tide,
not reckoning the length of the way,- besides,
as they are only boats, and not ships, they will
not venture to follow you far out to sea, espe-
cially if it blows--Well, said I, you have been
very kind inthis; what shall I do for you to
make you amends? --Sir, says he, you may
not be willing to make me any amends, beause
you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I
will make an offer to you; I have nineteen
months' pay due to me on hard the ship " 't' *,
which I came out of England in; and the
Dutchman that is with me has seven months'
pay due to him i if you will make good our pay
to us, we will go along with you: it'vou find

213

nothing more in it, wimp. no more:
but if we do convince yout e have saved
your lives, and the ship,and the lives of all the
men in her, we will leave the test to you.

I consented to this readily, and went imme-
diately on board, and the two 'men with me.
As soon as i. came to the ship's side, my part-
ner, who wagon board, came out on tho quar-
terdeclt, and called to me, with a great deal of
joy, 0 ha! 0 ho! we have stopped the leak!
we have stopped the leak !--Say you so?
said I, thank God; but weigh anchor then
immediately.---Weighl says he ; what do you
mean by that'! What is the matter I--Ask no
questions, said I; but all hands to work, and
Weigh without losing a minute. He was sur-
prised, but, however, he called the captain,
and he immediately ordered the anchor to he
got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet a little land breeze blowing. we stood out
to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and
told him the story; and we called in the men,
and they told us the rest of it: but as it took up
a great deal or time, before we had done a sea-
man comes to the cabin door, and called out to
usthat the captain bade him tell us we were
chased. Chased! says I ; by what ?---By five
sloops, or boats, says the fellow, full of men.--
Very well, said I t then it is apparent there is
something in it. In the next place I ordered
all our men to be called up, and told them
there was a design to seize the ship, and to
take us for pirates, and asked them. if they
would stand by us, and by one another; the
men answered cheerfully, one and all, that
they would live and die with us. Then I ulted
the captain what way he thought best for
us to manage a fight with them; for resist
them I was resolved we would, and that to the
last drop. He said readily that the way was
to keep them at" with ourgreat shot as long as
we could, and then to fire at them with our
small arms, to keep them fiom boarding us;
but when neither of these would do any longer,
we should retire to our close quarters; perhaps

The gunner had, in the mean time, order:
to bring two guns to bear lore and aft, out of
the steer-age, to clear the deck, and load them
with musket bullets and small pieces of old iron,
and what aims next to hand: and thus we
'made ready for fight; but all this while we
kept out tosea, with wind enough, Ind could
see the boats at a distance, being five largo
longboats, following us wuh all the sail they
could make.

Two ofthose boats (which by our glasses we
could see were English) outaailcd the rest, were
near two leagues ahead of them, and gained
upon us considerably, so that we found they
would come up with us; upon which we fired a
gun without ball, to intimate that they should
bring to z and we put outa flagaftruce, as aaigml
for parloy; but they came crowding after us, till
they came within shot, when we took in our
white flag, they having made no amwcr to it,
and hung out a red flag, and fired at them with a
shot. Nothtt'ithstaltding this, they came on till
they were near enough to call to them with a
speaking-trumpet which we had on board; so
we called to them, and bade them ltecp 06', at
their peril.

It was all one: they crowded after us, and
endeavoured to come under our stern, so as to
board as on our quarter; upon which, seeing
they were resolute for mischief, and depended
upon the strength that followed them, I ordered
tobring the ship to, sothat they lav upon our
broadside; when immediately we tired tive guns
at them, one ofwhich had been levelled so true
as to carry away the stern of the hindennost
boat, and bring them to the necessity-of taking
down their sail, and running all to the head of
the boat to keepht-r from sinking; soshe lay by,
and had enough ofit; but seeing the foremost
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at
her in particular. "'hilo this was doing, one
ofthe three boats that was behind, being fob
wardcr than the other two, made up to the boat
which we had disabled. to relieve her, and we

his two chase guns, and fired again at her, but

getting quickly ready again, lircd among them a
second time, one shot of which, though' tt mis-
:ed the boat itself, yet fell to among the men,
and we could easily see had done a great deal of
mischief among them; but we took no notice of
that, wore the ship again. and brought our quar-
ter tu bearupon them.and firing three guns more,
we found the boat was almost split to pieces;
in particular, her rudder and a piece of her
stem was shot quits away; so they handed her
sail immediately, and were in great disorder.

But to complete their misfortune, our gunner
let fly two guns at them again; where he hit

side, with ordt-rs topiclt upaomeof the men, if
they could, and save them from drowning, and
immediately come on board the ship with them.
because we saw the restof the boats began to
come up. Our men in the pinnace followed
their orders, and took up three men, one of
whom was just drowning, and it was agood
"hilt: before we could recover him. As soon
as they were on board, we crowded all the sail
we could make, and stood farther out to sea- ,
and we found that when the other three boats
came up to the first, they gave over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger, which,
though I knew not the reason ofit. yet seemed
to be much greaterthan I apprehended, I re-
solved that we should change our course, and
not let any one know whither we were going; so
we stood ottt to sea eastward, quite out of
the course of all European ships, whether they
were bound to China or any where else within
the commerce of the European nations.

When we were at see, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and inquire what the
meaning of all this should be; and the Dutch-
man lot as into the secret at once, tellingus that
the follow that sold us the ship, as we said, was
no more than athief, that had run away with
her. Then he told us how the captain, whose
name too he told us, though! donut remember
itnovv, was treachemusly murdered by the na-
tives on the coast of Malacca, with threeof his
men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four
more, got intothe woods, where they wandered
aboutagreat while, tiltatlcngthhe, in particu-
lar, in a miraculous manner, made his escape,
and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing
near the shore in its way from China, had sent
their boat on shore for fresh water : that be durst
not come to that part of the shore where the boat
was, but made shift in the night totalte the water
farther off, and swimming a. great while, at
last the ship's boat took him up. He then told
us that he went to Batavia, when two of the
seamen belongingto the ship arrived, having
deserted the rest in their travels, and gave an
account that the fellow whohad run away with
the ship sold her at Bengal to a setof pirates,
which were gone acruising in her: and that they
had already taken an English ship and two
Dutch ships very richly laden. .

This latter part was lbund to concern us
directly, though no knew it to be false; yet, as
my partner said very justly, if we had fallen into
their hands. and they had had such apropos-
ussion against us beforehand, it had been in
vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to
hope for any goodquartarat their hands; and
midly considering that or! accuser: had
been our judges, and that we could have ex-
pected nothing from them but what rage would
have dictated, and an ungoverned passion have
executed: and therefore it was his opinionwe
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence
we came, without putting in at any port. what-
ever; because there we could give a good ac-
count of ourselves, could prove where we were
when the ship put in, ofvvhornwe bought her,
and the like; and, which was more than all tho
rest, il'wc were put upon the necessity ofbring-
ing it bI-lbre the proper judges, we should be
sure to have some justIce, and not to be hanged
first and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partnet's opinion;
but afier II little more serious thinking, I told
him I thought it was avery great hazard for us
to attempt returning to Bengal. for that we were
on the wrong side ofthe Straits of Malacca,
and that if the alarm was given, we should be
sure to be waylaid on every side, as well by
the Dutch ofBzitaviaas the English elsewhere ,
that if we should be taken, as it were. running
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and
(ht-re would want no more evidence to destroy
us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion,
who said he was of my mind, and that we
should certainly be taken. This danger a
little stanled my partner, and all the ship'-
company, and we immediately resolved to go
away to the coastot'Tooquin, and soon to the
coast of China; and, pursuing the first design
or to trade, find some way or other to dispose
oftht- ship, and comeback in some ofthe vec-
eels ot'Ihe country, such as We could get. This
was approved of as tho best method for our
security; and accordingly we steered away
N. N. E. keeping above tit'ty leagues of? from
the usual course to the eastward. This,hovh
ever, put us to some inconvenience; for, first,
the winds, when we came. to that distance from
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against
us, blowingalmoet trade. as we call it, from the
Bland E. N. E. cothat we werea long while
upon our voy age,and we were but ill provided
with victuals Torso long arun; and, whichwas
still worse, there was some danger that those
English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued
us, whereof some were bound that way, might
be got in before us,andil' not,sorneother ship
bound to China might have infitrmation ot'us
from them, and pursue us with the lame
vigour.

nor had I ever done any thing that merited the
name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less
thievish; I had chiefly been my own enemy,
or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody'a
enemy but my own: but now I was crnbar-
rassed in the worst condition imaginable; for
though I. was perfectly innocent, I was' in no
condition to make that innocence appear : and
if I had been taken, it had been under n sup-
posed guilt of the worst kind. This mode the

Macao, a town once in possession of the P
tugueae, and where still a great many Eur!>>
pcan families resided; and particularly the
missionary priests mually went thither, in
order to their going forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go, and ac-
cordingly, though after a tedious and irregular
course, and very much straitenedfitrprwisi',
we came within eight of the coast very early I
the morning; and upon reflection on the past
circumstances we were in, and the danger if

ofwater for us, and to see il'Ive could, either

This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance.
for though we did not immediately see any
European ships to the bay of'l'onquin, yet the
next morning there came into the buy two
Dutch ships ; and a third, without anycoloua

and it was in this beating up along the shore

that we discovered we were surrounded with'

enemies. The people we were among were
the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the
coast, having no correspondence with any other
nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, Ind
such <<rose commodities: and it may be par-
ticulariy seen that they are the most barbarous
of any of the inhabitants. Among other cus-
toms, they have this one, viz. that If any vessel
has the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon
their coast, they presently make the men all
prisoners or slaves: and it was not long before
we found a piece of their kindness this way, on
the occasion following.

I have observed above, that our ship sprung
a leak at sea, and that we could not find it out;
and it happened that, as I have said, it was

Ipcd unexpectedly, in the happy minute or

being to be seized by the Dutch anti English
ships in the bay oiSiam ; yet as we did not find
the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we de-
sired, we resolved, while we wurcat this place,
to lay her on shore,and take out what heavy
things we hatlon board, and clean her bottom ,
and, if possible, to find onto-here the leaks
were. Accordingly, having lightened the ship p,
and brought all our guns and other moveahlee
to one side, we tried to bring her down. that we
might come at her bottom; but on second
thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry
ground, neither could we find out a proper
place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been at:-
quainted with such a sight, came wandering
down the shore to look at us; and seeing the
ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and
heelin-z in towards the shore, and not seeing
our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats on theofl' side, they
presently concluded that the ship was castaway,
and lay so fast on the ground. On this suppo-
sition, they all came about us in twoor three
hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men in a
boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on
board and plunderedthe ship; and if they had
found us there, to have carried us away for
slaves to their king, or whatever they call him,
for we knew nothing of their governor.

When they came up to the ship and began
to new round her, they discovered us all hard at
work on the outside of the ship's bottom and
side, washing, and graying, and stopping, as
every seafaring man knows how. They stood
for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a.
little surprised, could not imagine what their

design was; but being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get norm of us into the
ship, and othersto hand down arms and ammu-
nition to those that Were at worlt todei'end them-
selves with, if there should be occasion; and it
v'as nontorethen need; for iniesathan aqusrtcr
of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it scents
that the ship was really a wreck; and that we
were all at work endeavouring to save her, or
to save our livra by the helpof our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boats, they
concluded by that motion, that we were env
deavouring to save some of our goods; upon
this they took it for granted we all belonged to
them, and away they came directly upon our
men, asil' it had been in a line oi'battle.

were upon them , and two oftheir boats boarded
our lon-tboat, and began to lay hold on the men
as their prisoners.

The firstman theylaid hold on was an English
seamen, a stout, strong fellow, who, having:
musket in his hand, never offered to fire it, but
laid it down in the boat, like a. fuel, as I thought ;
but he understood his business better than I could
teach him, for he grappled the pagan, and drag-
ged him by main force out oftheir boat into ours,
where tnltinghim by the ears, he beat his head
so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died
in his hands: and, in the meantime, a Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and
with the butt-end ofit solaid about him, that he
knocked down five of them who attempted to
enter the boat. But this was doing little .to-
wards resisting thirty or forty then, who fearlm,
because ignorant of their danger, began to throvv
themselves into the lonaboat, where we had but
five men in all to defend it; but the iitllowing
accident, which deserved our laughter, gave
our men a complete victory

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams
where he had callted her to stop the leaks, had
gottwoltettles just let down into the boat, one
filled with boiling pitch, and the other with
rosin, talluw, and oil, and such stuff as the
shipwright: use for that work; and the man
that attended the earpenterhadagreatiron ladle
in his hand, with which he supplied the men
that were at work with the hot stufl'; two of the
enemy's men entered theboat just where this
fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladle litll of the stuff;
boiling hot, whichso hunted and scalded' them,
being half naked, that they roared out like bulls,
and, enraged with the fire, leaped both into the
sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, W'ell
done, Jack! give them some more of it: and
stepping forward himself, takes one ofthe mops,
and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man
threw it among them so plentifully, that, in
short, of all the men in the three boats there was
not one that escaped being scaldeil and burned
with it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and
made such a howling and crying, that i never
heard a worse noise: for it is Worth observing,
that though pain naturally makes all people cry
out, yet every nation has a particular way of ex-
claination, and makes noises asdifl'event from
one another as their speech. I cannot give the
noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of
it; for I never heard any thing more like the
noise of the wolves, which. as I have said, I
heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Lan-
giiudoc.

I was never better pleased with a victory in
my life; not onlyas it was a perfect surprise to
me, and that our danger was imminent before,
but, aswe got this victory without any blood-
shed, except of that man the fellow killed with
his naked hands, and which I was very much
concerned at, for l was sick of killing such poor
savage wretches, even though it was in my own
defence. knowing they cemeon errands which
they thoughtjust, and knew no better; and that
though it may be ajust thing, because necessary,

yet i thought it was a and life, when we must be
aiways obliged to be killing our fellow creatures

rather than I would take away the life evealofths

the mideration of it.

But to return to my stern--All the while
this was doing, my partner and I, who n'ia'
naged therest ofthemen onboard,had with
great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights,
and having gotthe guns intotheir places again,
the gunner called to me to bid our boat getout

work without him; but hid- liim heat another

with what they had met with in their fim
attack, that they would not come on again;
and some of them who were fitnheet oflgseeing
the ahipswim, as it were, upright, began, as
we suppose, to see their mistake, and give
over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry
fight, and having got some rice, and some roots
and bread, with about sixteen hogs.on board,
two days before, we resolved to stay here no
longer, but go forward, whatever came of it:
for we made no doubt but weshould he sur-
rounded the next day with rogues enough,
perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dis-
pose of ("or us. We therefore got all our things
on board the same evening, and the next
morning were ready to sail: in the meantime,
lying at anchor at some distance from the shore,
we were not somueh concerned, beingnow inn
fighting posture, aswell as in a sailing poem,
if any enemy had presented. The next day,
having finished our work within board, and
finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her
leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into
the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inliivin
ourselves of what was to be known calming
the Dutch ships that had been there; but we
durst not stand in there, because we had seen
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little
before; so we kept on N. E. tom the
island of Formosa, as much afraid of being
seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as
a Dutch or English merchant ship in the
Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war.

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on

we might not fill into the way of anyd'the

From thence we sailed still north, keeping
the coast of China at an equal distance , till we
knew we were beyond all the ports of China
where our l-Zurnpt-an ships usually come; being
resolved. ifltos'sible. not to fall into any of their
hands, cr'lrt'cially in thiscountry; nhercusour

Being now come to the latitude of thirty

us, with on old Portuguese pilot on board,
who knowing us to bean European ship, tame
to (thin his service, which, indeed, we were
glad of, and tool: him on board; upon which,
without asking us whither we would go. he
dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it
back.

to make the old man carry us whither we

here? I told him we would sell our cargo
and purchase China wares, mlicoee', raw ailke,
tea, wrought silks, &c. and so would return

best port had been to have put in at Macao,
where we could not have failed ofantarltet
for our opium to our satisfaction, and might
for our money have purchased all sorts of
China goods aschcap as we could at Nanquin.

Not being able to put the old man out of
his talk, of which he was very opinionated or
conceited, I told him we Were gentlemen as
wull as merchants, and that we had a mind to
go and see the great city of Felting, anti the
famous court of the monarch ofChina. Why
then, says the old man, you should go to
Ningpo,wltt:re, by the river which runs into
the set: there, you may go up within five
leagues ol' the great canal. This canal is a
navigable stream, which goes through the
heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all
the rivers, passes some considerable hills by
the help oi'sluicea and gates, and goes up to
the city of Petting, being in length near two

way just beibre. This gave men little shock,
for a Dutch chip was new our terror, and we
had much rather have met the devil, at least it"
he had not come in too li'ightful a figure; and
we depended upon it that a Dutch ship would
be our destruction, for we were in no condition
to fight them; all the ships they trade with into

greater force than we were.

If I had any blood in my body that did not
fly up into my face at that word, it was hin-
dered by some llop in the vcarcls appointed by
nature to circulate it, tbr it put me into the
greatest disorder and confusion imaginable:
nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but
the old man easily perceived it.

Sir, says he, I find you are in somedisorder

to go which way you think fit,snd depend
upon it, I'll do you all the rervico learnt--Why,
senhor, said I, it is true, I am a little unsettled
in my resolution at this time, whither to go in
particular; and I am something more so for
what you said about pirates. I hope thercsre
no pirates inthexe seas; we are but in an ill
condition to meet with them, for you see we
have but a small force, and are but very weakly
manned--0, sir, says he, don't be concerned,
Ido not know that there have been any pi-
rates in these seas these fifteen years, except
one, which was seen, as I hear. in the bay of
Siam. chum a month since; but you may be
assured she is gone to the southward: nor was
she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work; she was not built for a privalrer, but
was run away with by a reprnbate crew that
was _un board. after the captain and some of
his men had been murdered by the Malayaue,
at or hearth-s island of Sumatra--"dial! said
I, seeming to know nothing of the matter, did
they murder the captain '!--No. raid he, I
don't understand that they murdered him; but
as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it
iagencrally believed that they betrayed him

of the great gulf of Nanquin; where, by the
way. I came by accident to underatand that two
Dutch ships were gone the length before me,
and that i should certainly fall into their handl.
I consulted my partner again in this exigency,
andhewasasmuchat a loss as I Was,and
would very gladly have been safe on shore
almost any where; however, I was not in Inch
perplexit y neither. but I asked the old pilot if
there was no creek or harbour which I might
put into and pursue my business with the Chi-
nese privately, andbe in no dangerof the ene-
my. He told rnc,if 1 would rail to the anath-
ward about lbrty-two leagues, there waaa little
port called Quinehang, where the fathers of tho
missidn usually landed from Macao, on their
program to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese, and where no European ship: ever
put in ; and if I thought to put in there, I might
consider what further course to take when I
was on shore. He confessed, he laid, it was
not a place for merchants, except that at some
certain times they had it kind of afair there,
when the merchants from Japan came over
thither to buy the Chinese merchandisee.

\Vc all agreed to go back to this place; the
name of the port, ashecalled it, I may perhaps
Ipell wrong, for I dunot particularly remember
it, having lost this, together with the names at
many other places set down in a little pocket-
book, which was spoiled by the water byan
accident; but this I remember, that the Chi-
nese or Japanese merchants We corresponded
with called it bya did'erent name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pro-
nounced it as above, Quiuchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to
go to this place, we weighed the next day,
having only gone twice on chore where we
were to get fresh water: on both which occu-
aions the people of the country were very civil
tour, and brought us abundance of thing- to
cell to III, I mean of provisions, plants, roots,
tea, rice, and some fowls, but nothing without
money.

We came to the other port (the wind being
contrary) not till five days, but it was very
much toottr misfaction', and I wasjoyt'ul, and
1 may say thankful. when I set my foot on
shore, resolving. and my partner too, that if it
was possible todispose of ourselves endetl'ecu
any other way, though not every way to our
satisfaction, we would never set one foot on
board that unhappy vessel more a and, indeed,

stances of life that ever I had any experience

of, nothing makes mnnltind ao cotaplotely
miserable as that of being in constant fear.
Well does the Scripture ray, " The fearofmnn
bring: a more ;" it in 1 life of death, and the
mind is an entirely oppressed by it, that it is
capable of no relief.

Nor did it fail of ita usual operations upon
the fancy, by heightening evury danger, repro-
renting the English and Dutch captains to be
men incapable of hearing reason,or of distin-
guishing between honcat men and rogues; or
between a story calculated ibr our own turn,
made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive,
and a true genuine account of our whole voy-
age, progress, and design; for we might many
ways hove convinced any reasonable creature
that we were not pirates; the goods we had
on board, the cornea we ateered, our frankly
showing ourselves, and entering into such and
such ports; and oven our very manner, the
force we had, the number of men, the few arms,
little ammunition, short provisions: all then
would have served to convince any men that
we were no piratel. The opium and other>>
goods we had on board would make it appear
tho ship had been at. Bengal. The Dutchmen,
who, it was said, had the names of all the men
that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and
Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board.
These, and many other particular circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the
understanding of any commander, whose hand.
we might fall into, that we were no piratev.
But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked
another way, and threw us into the vapourv;
it bcwtldered our understandingl, and net the
imagination at work to litrma thounnd terrible
things that perhaps might never happen. We
first lupposed, as indeed every body had related
to us, that the seamen on board the English
and Dutch chips, but especially the Dutch,
were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and
especially at our beating ofl' their boats and
escaping, that they would not give themselves
leave to inquire whether we were pirates or
no; but would execute us off hand, as we call
it, witltout giving us any room for a defence.
We reflected that there really was so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would
coerce inquire aller any borer", fint, thet
the chip was certainly the same, and that some
of the seamen among them know her. and had
beenou board her; and, secondly, that when
we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia
that they were coming down to examine us, we
fought their boats and fled: to that we made
no doubt but thev were an fully aatisfied of at:
beingpirates, aswe were aatisfiedot'thecon-
trary; and, as! oflensaid, Iltnow not but I
ahould have been apt to have taken those clh
cumstances for ovidmce, if the tables were
turned, and my case was theirs; and have
made no scmple of cutting all the crew to
pieces, without believing, or considerh
ing, what they might have to otfer in their
defence.

But let that be how it will, these were our
apgwuhcnsions; and both my partner and I
scarce slept anight without dreaming ot'halters
and yardarrns, that is to say, gibbets; ot'fight-
ing, and being atom or killing, and being
killed ; and one night 1 was in such a Iiiry in
my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had board-
ed on, and! "run knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my doubled fist against
the aide ot'tho cahinI lay in, with such afotuo,
as wounded my hand grievously, broke my
knuckles, and cut and bruied the flesh," that
it awaited me out of my sleep.

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel
usage we might meet with from them if we fell
into their hands: then the story of Amboyna
came into my head, and how the Dutch might
perhsps torture us, as they did our countrymen
there, and make some of our men, by extremity
of torture, confess those crimes they never were
guilty of, or own themselves and all ofus to be
pirates,and so they would put us to death with
a formal appearance of justice; and that they
might be tempted to do this for the gain of our
ship and cargo, which was worth fill! or five
thousand pounds, put all together.

These things tormented me and my partner
too,night anddayt nor did we consider that
the captains of ships have no authority to not
thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to
them, they could not answer the destroying us,
or torturing us, but would be acuotmtable for it
when they came to their own country; this, I
say, gave mo no satisfaction; lbr if they were
to act thus with us, whatadvantage would itho
tousthattheyahouldbecalled to an account
for it i or if we were first-lobe murdered, what
satisfaction would it be to us to have them
punished whenthey came home?

Icannotrefiaintaltingnotico herewhat ro-
flectionslnowhad upon the vast variety of
my particular circumnances; how hard I
thought it was, that I, who had spent forty
years in a life ot'contimal dificulties,andwas

' Afler these thoughts, something ofrcligion
would come in: and I should be considering

bution; and that! ought to aubmittothis, jut

God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natural mug. would metimco
take its place, and then I would be talkin
myself up to vigorous resolutions; that I walls
notbe taken tobe barbarouslyused by a parcel
of merciless wretchcs in cold blood: that it
were much better to have fallen into the hands
of the savages, though I was sure they would
feast upon me when they had taltcn me, than
those who would perhaps glut tlieir rage u'pon
me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that

men's hands, than ever it was to think of being
eaten by men? for the savages, give them
their due, would not eat a man till he was

arts beyond the malty of death. Whenever
these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put
myself into a ltind of fever with the agitation

""ltt-u we came on shore, the old pilot, who
was now our friend, got us a lodging and a

with canes, and palisadoed round with large

set-nu, there were not a few in that country;
hows-vor, the magistrates allowed us a little
guard, anti we had a soldier with a kind ofhal-
bertl, or half-pike, who stood sentinel at our
door: In whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a
little piece oftnoncy, about the value ofthreo-
pence, per day, so that our goods were kept
very safe.

The fair, or mart, tuually kept in this place,
had bet-nm'cr some time ; however, we found
that there were three or four junlts in the river,
and two Japaners, I mean ships from Japan,
with goods which tltey had bought in China,
and were not gone away, having some Japanese
mcrt'ltnltls on here.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did
for us was, to get us acquainted with three mis-
sionary Ilomish priests who were in town, and
who had been there some time cMVerting the
people to Christianity; but we thought they
made but poor work of it, and made them but
sorry Christians when they had done ; however,
that was none of our business. One oftheso was
a Frenchman, whom they called FatherSimon;
mother was a Portuguese, and the third a.
Genncse; but Father Simon was courteous,
easy in his manner, and very agreeable com-
pany: the other two were more reserved,
scented rigid and austere, and applied seriously
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with,
and insinuate themelves among, the inha-
bitants, wherever they had opportunity. We
often ate and drank with those men; and
thnugh, I must confess, the conversion, as they
call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far
from the true conversion required to bring hel-
then people to the faith ofChrist, that it seems
to amount to little more than letting them know
the name of Christ, and say some prayers to the
Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which
they understand not, and to cross themselves,
and the like; yet it must he confessed that the
rcligionists, whom we call missionaries, have a
firm belief that these people will be raved, and
that they are the instruments oi'it; and, on
this account, they undergo not only the fatigue
ofthe voyage, and the hazards ni'livingin such
places, but ottentitnee death itself, with the

But to return to my story: This French
priest, Father Simon, was appoinwd, it seem,
by order ofthe chiefot't-be mission, to go up to
Peking, the roynl seat of the Chinese emperor,
and waited only for another priest, who was
ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along
with him: and we scarce ever met together
but he was inviting me to go that journey;
telling me how he would show me all the glo-
rious things of that mighty empire, and, among
the rest, the greatest city in the world; a city,
said he, that your London and our Paris put to-
gether, cannot. be equal to. This was the city
of Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and
infinitely full of people; but as I looked on
those things with difl'erent eyes from other men,
so I shall give my opinion of them in a few
words, when I come in the course ofmytravela
to speak more particularly of them.

But, first, I come to my trim or missionary.
Dining with him one day, and being very merry
together, I showed some little inclination to go
with him ; and he pressed me and my partner
very hard, and with 1 great many persuasions,
to consent. Why, Father Simon, says my
partner, should you desire our company so
much? you know we are heretics, and you do
not love us, nor cannot keep us company with
say plenum--0, says he, you may perhaps
be good catholics in time: my business here is
to convert heatheus, and who knows but I may
convert you too 1--Very well, Father, said I, so
you will preach tous all the way 1--]. will not
be troublesome to you, says he: our religion
does not divest usot' good manners: besides, we
are here like countrymen ; and so we are, corn-
pared to the place we are in; and if you are
huguenots, and I a catholic, we may all be
Christian: at last : at least, we are all gen-
tlemen, and tve may converse so, without being
uneasy to one another. I liked this part of his
discourse very well, and it began to put me in
mind ofmy priest that I had [ch in the Brazils;
but this Father Simon did not come up to his
character by a great deal; for though Father
Simon had no rance ol'a criminsl levity
in him neither, yet he had not that fund ot'
Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere lfl'ection
hand religion, that my other good ecclesiastic

in a place ofvery little hairless; and once I
was about to venture to sail for the river of
Kilam, and the city of Nanquin; hut Provi-
dence seemed now more visibly, as I thought,
than ever, to concern itselfin our afl'airs; and
I was encouraged, from this very time, to
think 1 should one way or other get out of
this entangled circumstance, and he brought
horneto my ownoountryagain, thoughl had
not the least viewof the manner. Providence,
I say, began here to clear up our way a little:
and the first thing that offered was, that our
old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant
to us, who inquired what goods we had; and;
in the first place, he bought all our opium,
and gave I! a very good price for it, poying us
in gold by weight, some in small pieces of
their own coin, and some in small wedges, of
about ten or eleven otmces each. While we
were dealing with him for ouropium, it came
into my hend that he might perhaps deal for
the ship too, and I ordered the interpreter to
propose it to him; he shrunk up his shoulders
at it. when it was first to him: but
in a few days after he came to me, with one
of the missionary priests for his interpreter,
andtold me hehad apmposal tomaltetotne,
which was thin--he had bought a great quan-
tity of pods of us, when he had no thoughts
of proposals made to him of buying the ship;
and that, therefore, he had not money enough
to payfortheshipfliut if! would letthoaarne
men who were in the ship navigate her, he
would hire the ship to go to Japan: andwould
send them from thence to the Philippine islands
with another loading, which he would pay the
freight ofhefore they went from Japan; and
that at their return he would buy the ship. I
began to listen to his proposal, and so eager
did my head still run upon rambling, that I
could not but begin to entertain a notion of
going mpelf with him, and so to sail from
the Philippine islandsaway to the South Seas;
accordingly I asked the Japanese merchant if
he would not hire us to the Philippine islands,
and discharge us there. He said, No, he
oouldnot dothat,forthen he could not have
the return of his cargo; but he would discharge
us in Japan, attire ship's return. Well, still
I wasfortahinghimatthatprqiosal,and going
myself; but my partner, wiser than myself,
persuaded me fiotn it, representing the dais-
ger-s, aswellofthe seasasot'the Japanese,
whoare a false, anei, and trescherouspeo-
pie; likewise those of the Spaniards at the
Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous
than they.

was, to consult with the captain of the
ship, and with his men, and know if they
were willing to goto Japanzand while I was
doing this, the young man whom my nephew
had left with me as my companion thr my tra-
vels came to me, and told me that he thought
that voyage promised very fair, and that there
was a great of advantage, and he
would beveryglad iflundertoolt it; but that
if [would not. and would give him leave, he
would go as amerchant,orhow I pleased to
order him; that if ever he came to England,
and I was there and alive, he would' render
me a faithful ancemt ofhis mess, which
should be as much mine as I pleased. I was
really loath to part with him; but considering
the prospect of advantage, which really was
comiderablu, and that he was a young fellow
as likely to do well in it as any i knew, I in-
clined to let him go; but I told hint I would
consult my partner, and give him an answer
the nest dny. My partner and I discerned
about it, andruypnrtnerrnadea mestgene-
rotuofl'er: You know it has been an unlucky

to sea in it again: ifyour steward (ache
called my man) will venture the voyage, I will

him make the best ofittand ifwe live tomeet

Iftnypartner,whowas nowayceocerned

same: and all the ship's company being willing
to go with him, we made over halfthe ship to

Here, having got a good acquaintance at Ma-
nilla. he got his ship made a free ship; and the
governor of Manilla hired him to go to Aca-
pulco in America, on the coast of Mexico, and
gave him a licence to land there, and to travel
to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to
Europe with all his men. He made the voy-
age to Acapulco very happily, and there he
sold his ship; and having there also obtained
alluwance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he
fiiund means, somehow or other, to get to Ja-
maica, with all his treasure; and about eight
years after came to England exceeding riclt, e.
which I shall talte notice in its place; in the
meantime, I retum to our particular affairs.

Being now to part with the ship and ship's
company, it came before us, of course, to con.
sider what recompense we should give to the
two men that gave us such timely notice of the
design against us in the river Cambodia. The
truth was, they had done us a very considera-
ble service, and deserved well at our hands;
though by the way, they were e. couple of
rogues too; fitr as they believed the story of
our being pirates, and that we had really run
away with the ship, they came down to us not
only to betray the design that was formed
against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates;
and one of them confessed afterwards that
nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing
brought him to do it: however, the service
dteydid us was not the lens; and, therefore,
as I had promised to begrateful to them,l first
ordered the money to be paid them which they
said was due to them on board their respective
ships; over and above that, I gave each of
them a small sum ofmoney in gold, which con-
tented them very well; then I made the Eng-
lishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being
now made second mate and punter; the Dutch-
man I made boatswain; so they were both
very well pleased, and proved very serviceable,
being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.

in and our goods whither we pleased. This I
liked very well, and resolved to wait ; besides

as our particular persons were not obnoxious,
so if any English or Dutch ships came thither

perhaps we might have an opportunity to lead
our goods, and get paeaageto some other place
in India, nearer home. Upon these hopes
we resolved to continue here; but, to divert
ourselves, we took two or three journeys into
the country. First, we went ten davs' journey,
to the city ofNanquin, a city well worth seeing
indeed; they say it has a million of people in
it: it is regularly built, the streets all exactly
straight, and cross one another in direct lines,
which gives the figure of it great advantage.
But when I come to re the miserable
people of these countries with ours, their fa-
brics, their manner of living, their government,
their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as
some call it, I must confess that 1 mmer
think it worth my while to mention them here.
It is very observable, that we wonder at the
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies,
the government, the manufactures, the corn-
merce, and conduct of these people; not that
it is tobe wondered at, or, indeed, in the least
tobe regarded, butbcause having a true no-
tion of the barbarity of those countries, the
rudeness and the ignorance that prevails there,
we do not oxpeu to find any such thing so far
elf. Otherwise, what are their buildings to
the palaces and royal building: of Europe?
"that their trade to the universal commerce of
England, Holland, France, and Spain? What
are their cities to outs, for wealth, strength,
gayetyof apparel, rich furnitttre, and infinite
variety ? that are their ports, supplied with
a few junks and barks, to our navigation, our
merchant fleets, our large and powerful navies 1'
Our city of London has more trade than half
their mighty empire: one English, Dutch, or
French man of war of eighty guns, would be
able to light almost all the shipping belonging
to China: but the greatness of their wealth,
their trade, the power of their government, and ,
the strength of their armies, may be a little
surprising to us, because as I have said, con-
sidering them use barbarous nation of pagans,
little better than sat-ages, we did not expect
such things among them: and this, indeed. is
the advantage with which all their greatness
and power is represented tous; otherwise, it
is in itself nothing at all ; for what! line said
oftheir ships may be said oftheirartniee and
troops, all the forces of their empire, though
they were to bring two millions of men into
the field together, would be able to do nothing
but ruin the country, and starve themselves, if
they were tobeeiege astrong town in Flanders.
or to fight a disciplined army; one good line
of German euirassiers, or of French cavalry,
might withstand all the horse of China; a mil-
lion of their foot could not stand before one
embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not
tobasurrounded,thoughtheywerenottobeone
to twenty in number; nay, I do not boast if I
say that thirty thousand German or English
foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed,
'coulddel'eat all theforceeofChina; and sool'
our fortified towns, and of the art of our engi-
neers in assaulting and defending towns; there
is note. fortified town in China could hold out
one month against the batteries and attacks of
an European army; and, at the same time, all
the armies of China could never take such a
townas Dunkirk, provided it was not starved;
no, notin a ten years' siege. They have fire:
arms, it istrue, but they are awkward and unc
certain in their going off; and their powder
has but little strength. Their armies are badly
disciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper
to retreat; and, therefore, I must confess, it
Ieenwd strange to me, when I came home, and
heard our people say such fine things of the
power, glory, magnificence, and trade of the

Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they ap-'

peared tobeacontemptible herd orcrowd orig-
nerant sordid slaves, subjected to agovemment
qualified only to rule such a people: and were
not its distance inconceivably great from Mus-
navy, and the Museovite empire in a manner
as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the
our of Museovy might with ease drive them
all out of their country, and conquer them in

proved himself in the art of war, as they say
behasdona; and it'noneofthe powers ofEu-
rope had envied or interrupted him, he might by
this timd have been emperor ol'China, instead
of being beaten by the king of Sweden at Nah
u, when the latter wasnot one to six in num-
ber. As their strength and their grandeur, so
their navigation, commerce, and husbandry is
very imperfect, compared tothe same things in
Europe: also in their knowledge, their learning,
and in their skill in the sciences, they are
either very awkward or defective, though they
have globes and spheres, and a smattering of the
mathematics, and think they know more than
all the world besides; but they know little of
the motions of the heavenly bodies; and so
grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common
people. that when the sun is eclipsed, they think
a great dragon has assaulted it, and is going
to run away with it; and theyl'all a elauering
with all the drums and kettles in the country,
toll-ight thc monster away, just as we do to
hive a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of the kind
which I have made in all the accounts I have
given of my travels, so I shall make no more
such ; it is none of my busineu, nor any part
of my design ; but to give an account of my own
adventures through a life of inimitable wandeh
ings, and a long variety of changes, which,
perhaps, few that come>> filer me will have
heard the like of: I slid" therefore say very
little ofall the mighty places, dgeert countries,
and numerous people I have yet to pal
through, more than relates to myown story,
and, which my concern among them will make
necessary.

red it wholly to my partner, and lefl. it wholly
to his choice, who at length resolved it in the
aflirrnative, and we prepared for our journey.
We set out with very good advantage, as to
finding the way, for we got leave tetrnvel in the
retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of
vioeroy or principal magistrate in the province

sometimes greatly impoverished by them, be-
tng obliged to 'urnish provisions for them and
all their attendants in their journeys. That
which I particularly observed, as to our travel-
ling with his baggage, was this, that though we
received sufficient provisions both for ourselves
and our horses from the country, as belonging
to the Mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay
for every thing we had, after the market price
ofthe country, and the Mnndarin's steward
collected it duly from us ; so that our travelling
in the retinuo of the Mandarin, though it was
a very great kindness to us, was not such a
mighty favour. in him, but was a great advan-
tage to him, considering there were above
thirty other people travelled in the same man-
ner besides us, under the protection of his reti-
nue : for the country furnished all the provisions
for nothing to him, and yet he took our money
(hr them. ,

We were twenty-fivedays travelling to P0-
king, through a country infinitely populous, but
I think badly cultivated: the husbandry, the
economy, and the way of living miserable,
though they boastso much of the industry oftho
people: i say miserable, if compared with our
mm, but not so to these poor wretches, who
know no other. The pride of the people is infi-
nitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their
poverty, in some parts, which addsto that which
I call theirmisery; and I must needs think the
naked savages of America live much more hap-
py than the poorer sort ol'lhese, because as they
have nothing, aothey desire nothing; whereas
than are proud and insolent, and in the min are

in many parts mere beggars and drudgos : their
ostentation is inexpressible; and, it' they can,
they love to keep multitude of servants or slaves,
which is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as
the contempt of all the world but themselves.

I mtmconfess, I travelled more pleasantly af-
terwards in the deserts and vast wildernessos
of Grand Tartary than here; and yet the roads
here are well paved and well kept, and very
convenient for travellers ; but nothing was more
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, im-
perious, insolcnt people, in the midst of the
grossost simplicity and ignorance ;and my friend
Father Simon and I used to be very'merry upon
these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of
these people_: lbr example, coming by the house
of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called
him', aboutten leagues off the city of Nanquin,
we had first of all the honour to ride with the
master of the house about two miles; the state
he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being
a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was
very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew,
being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tas-
sets, and cuts and slashes almost on every side;
it covered atafl'ety vest, as as a butcher's,
and which testified that his honour must be a
most exquisite sloven. His horse was but a
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and he had
two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor
creature along; he had a whip in his hand, and
he belaboured the beast as fast about the head
as his slaves did about the tail ; and thus he rode
by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going
from the city to his country seat, pboul half-
leaguebefore us. we travelled on gently, but
this figure of a gentleman rode away before us,
and as we stepped at a village about an ltour to
refresh us, when wecame by the country seat of
this great man, we saw him in a little place be-
fore his door, eating his repast. It was a kind
ofagarden, but he wascasy lobe seen : and we
were given to understand that the more we
looked at him the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto,
which efl'ectually shaded him over the head, and
on the south side; but under the tree was also
placed a large umbrella, which made that part
look twll enough; he sat lolling back in a great
elbowehair, being a heavy oorpulent man, and
had his meal brought him by two women slaves;
he had two more, one of which fed the squire
with a spoon, and the other held the dish with
one hand, and scraped all" what he let fall upon
his worsltip's beard and tatl'ety vest with the
other; while the great fat brute thought it below
him to employ his own hands in any of those
familiar offices, which kings and monarchs
would rather do thanbe troubled with the clumsy
fingers of their servants.

I took this time to think what pains men's
pride puts them to, and how troublesome a
haughty temper, thus ill managed, must be to a
man 0f common sense; and leaving the poor
wrclch to please himself with our looking athim,
as if we admired his pomp, though we really
pitied and contemned him, we pursued our
journey; only Father Simon had the curiosity
to stay to inform himself what dainties the
country justice had to feed on in all his state,
which he had the honour to taste of, and which
was, I think, a mess ofboiled rice, with a great
piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with
green pepper, and another plant which they
have there, something like our ginger, but
smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard;
all this was put together, and a small piece of
lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his
worship'a repast; tour or five servants more
attended at a distance, who, we supposed, were
to eat of the same after their muter.

As for our Mandarin with whom we tra-
velled, he was respected as a king, surrounded
always with his gentlemen, and attended inall
hisa arances withsuch p,thatIsawlittle
of him but at a distance; but this Ioburved,
that there was not a horse in his retinue but
that our carriers' packhorses in England
scented to me to look much hotter; though it
was hard to judge rightly, firr they were so
covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c.
that we could scarce see any thing but their
feet and their heart as thcv went along.

227

I was now lighthearted, and all my trouble
and pcrplexity that I have given an account of
being over, I had no' anxious thought about
me, which made this journey the pleasanter to
me; nor had I any ill accident attended me,
only in passing or fording a small river my horse
fell, and made me free ofthc country, as they
call it, that is to say, threw me in; the place
was not deep, but it wcttcd me all over. I
mention it, because it spoiled my pocket-book,
wherein I had set rlown the names of sevural
people and places which I had occuion to re-
member, and which, not taking due care of,
the leaves rotted, and the words were never
after to be read, to my great loss as to the names
of some places I touched at in tlrisjoumey.

At length we arrived at Peking; I had no-
body with me but the youth whom my nephew
the captain had given me to attend Inc as a
servant,and who proved very trusty and dili-
gent; and my partner had nobody with him but
one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the
Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see the
court, we bore his charges for his company,
and to use him as an interpreter, lbr he under-
stood thc language of the country, and spoke
good French, and alittle English; and, indeed,
this old man was a most useful implement to
us every where; for we had not been above a
week at Peking, when he came laughing, Ah,
Scnhor Inglcse, says he, I have something to
tell you will make your heart glut--My heart
glad! says I; whatcanthat be? I don't know
any thing in this country can either give me
joy or grief, to any great degree--Yes, yes,
said the old man, in broken English, make you
glad, me sorry.--\Vhy, said I, will it make you
sorry'l--Because, said he, you have brought
me here twenty-five days' journey, and will
leave me to go back alone, and which way shall
I get to my port afterwards without a ship,
without a horse, without pecune: so he called
money, being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with. In short,
he told us there was a great caravan of Mus-
covite and Polish merchants in the city, pre-
paring to set out on their journey by land to
Mmovy, within four or five weeks, and he
was sure we would take the opportunity to go
with them, and leave him behind, to go back
alone.

I confess I wu greatly surprised with this
good news, and had scarce power to speak tt.
him tor some time ; but at last I turned to him,
How do you know this? said I. Are you sure
it is true 1--Yes, says he; I met this morning
in the street an old acquaintance ofmine, an
Armenian, who isarnong them; became last
liom Ashen, andwas designing togoto Ton-
quin, where I formerly knew him, but has al-
tered his mind, and is now resolved to go with
tlte caravan to Moscow, and so down the river
Wolga. to Astracall. Well, senhor, says
I, do not be uneasy about being left to gob-ck
alone ; if this he amethod for my return to Eng-
land, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all. We then went to consult toge-
ther what was tobe done; and I asked my
partner what he thought of the pilot's news,
and whether it would suit with his atl'airs?
He told me he would do just as I would; for
he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal,
and left his efi'ects in such good hands. that as
we had made a good voyage here, it' he could
vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be con-
tent to go to England, and then make his voy-
age back to Bengal by the company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed that
if our Portuguese pilot would go with In we
would bear his chargesto Moscowpr to England,
if he pleased; nor, indeed. were we to be es-
teemed over generous in that neither, if we
had not rewarded him farther, the service he
had done us being really worth more than that :
for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea,
but he had been like a broker for us on shore;
and his procuring for in the Japan merchant
was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it, and being
willing to gratify him, which was but doing
him justice, and very willing aka to have him
with us besides, for he was a most necessary
man on all occasion, we agreed to give him a
quantity ofcoined gold, which, as I compute
it, came toabout one hundred and seventy-five
pounds sterling, between us, and to bear all his
charges, both it Itiuuelf and horse, except
only a horse to his goods. Having set-
tled this between ourselves, we called him to
let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we
were resolved heehouldnotgobafiatall; that
as we had resolved to go to Europe with the
caravan, we resolved also he should go
with us; and that we called him toknow his
mind. He shook his head, and said, it was a
long journey, and he had no tocarry him
thither, or to subsist himself when he came
there. We told himwe believed itwasso, and
therefore we had resolved to do something for
him that should let him see how sensible we

ceivcd the proposal like amen transported, and
told us he would go with us over the whole

world; and so we all prepared for our journey.
However, asitwaswith us, suit was with the
other merchants; they had many things Iodo;
and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some days before all things
were got together.

It was the beginning of February, our style,
when we set out from Peking. My partner
and the old piloth gone express back to the
port where we had first put in, to disptee of
some goods which we had lefi there: and X,
with a Chinese merchant whom i had some
knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Peking on his own afl'airs, went to Nanquin,
where I bought ninety pieces offine damasks,
with about two hundred pieces of other very
fine silks of several sorts, some mixed with gold,
and had all these brought to Peking against
my partner's return; besides this, we bought
a very large quantity of raw silk, and some
other goods, our cargo amotmting, in these
goods only, tonbout three thousand five hundred

sterling; which, together with tea,
andsomofine caliooev, and three carnels' loads
of ntttmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels for our share, besides those we rode
upon: which, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in
our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as near
as Icon remember, made between three and
four hundred horse, and upwards of one hun-
dred and twenty men, very well armed, and
provided for all events: for as the eastern cs.-
nvsnsuesubject tobe attacked by the Arabs,

tncuey to a common stock, for the necessary
expense ofhuying flit-age on the way, where it
was not otherwise to he had, and forsatisfiing
the guides, getting horses, and the like: and
here they constituted tlte journey, as they call
it, viz. they named captains and oficeu to
draw us all up, and give the word ofcommand,
in ease of an attack, and give every one their
turn ofcommand; norm-as thisforming us into
order any more than what we found needful
upon the way. as shall he observed.

The rosdall on this side of the country is
very populous, and is full of potters and earth-
tnalters, that is to say, people that temper the
earth for the China-ware: and as I was oom-
tng along, our Portugal pilot, who had they:
something or other to say to make us merry,
came sneering to me, and told me he would
show me the greatest rarity in all the country,
and that [should have this to say of China,
alter all the ill-humoured things I had said of
it, that I had seen one thing which was not to
be seen in all the world beside. I was very
intportunate to know what it was: at last he told
me it magentlentan's house huiltwith China-
ware. Well, says I, are not the materials of
thetr buildings the product oftheir own country,
and so it is all Chinausare, is it not t--No, no,
says he, I mean it is a house all made of
China-ware, such as you call it in England, or
as it is called in our cotmtry, porcelain.----Well,
says 1, such a thing may be; how big is it?
Canwe earryitinahot upon acatnel'l ifwe
can, we will buy il.--Upot'l a camel! says the
old pilot, holding up both his hands; why there
is family of thirty people lives in it.

I was thencurious, indeed, tosee it; and
when I came to it, it was nothing but this: it
was a timber house, or a househuilt, astve call
it in England, with lath and plaster; but all
this plutering was really China-ware, that is
to say, it was plastered with the earth that
makes China-ware. The outside, which the
sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked
very well, perfectly white,and painted with
blue figures, as the large Chin-wan in Eng-
land ispsinted,andhardasit'ithadheen
horned. Astotheinaide,allthewalls,itr
stead of wainseot, were lined with hardened
and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we
call galley-tiles in England, all made of the
finest China, and the figures exceeding fine,
indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours,
mixed with gold : many tiles making but one

some mailer rooms, like cit-eta, which were
all in it were paved with the same tile: the
ceiling, and all the plastering work in the whole
house, were ofthe saute earth; and, after all,
the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deepshining black. This wasa China
warehouse, indeed, truly and literally to he
coiled so, tutd had I not been upon myjountey,
I could have stayed some days to see and ex-
aminethe particulars of it. They told me there
were fountainsand fishponds in the garden, all
paved on thebottom and sides with the same;
and finestatuesset upin rows on the walks,
entirely formed of the porcelain earth, . and
burned whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China,
so they may he allowed to excel in it; but I am
very sure they excel in their aooountl of it; for
they told match incredible things oftheir per.
fiirmance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that
1 care not to relate, as knowing it could notbo
true. They told me, in particular, ofone work-
man that made a ship with all its taekle, and
masts and sails, in earthen-ware, his enough
to carry filly men. If they had told me he
launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it,
I might have said something to it, indeed; but
as it was, I knew the wholeot' the story, which
was, in short, asking pardon for the word, that
the fellow lied; so I amtled, and said nothing
to it.

This odd sight kept me two bouts behind the
caravan, for which the leader of it fir the day
fined me about the value ofthree shillings; and
told me, if it had been three days'jotn-ney

trespassing our orders, (for so long the caravan
was in passing the gate.) to look at it on every
aide, nearand far 08', I mean that was within
my view; and the guide of ourcsravan,who
had been extolling it for the wonder ol'the world,
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it.
I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep
out the Tartan; which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a
compliment; but the old pilot laughed: 0,
Senhor Ingleee, says he, you speak in colours.
--ln colours! said I; what do you mean by
that 7--Why you speak what looks white this
way, and black that way; gay one way, and
dull another. You tell him it is good wall to
keep out Tartan; you tell me by tltat it is
good for nothing but to keep out Tartars. I
understand you, Senhor Ingleae ; I understand
you: but Senhor Chinese understood you his
own way.--Well,says I, sonhor, do you think
it would stand out an army of our country people,
with a good train ot' artillery, or our engineers,
with two companies of minors? "'ould not
they batter it down in ten days, that an army
might enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air,

of it left ?----Ay,ay, says he,l know that. The

after, for we were then almost out of their
country, and he was to leave us in alittle time
after this; but when he knew what lsaid,he
was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard
no more of his in story of the chinese power
and greatness whilu ho flayed. ~

After we passed this mighty nothing, called
awall,something like the Picts' wall.so famous
in Northumberland, built by the Romans, we
began to find the country thinly inhabited, and
the people rather confined to live in fortified
towns and cities, as being subject to the inroads
and depredations of the Tartan, who rob in
great armies, and therefore are not to be
resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open
country. And here 1 began to find the neces-
sity of keeping together in a caravan as we
travelled, for we saw several troops of Tartar!
raving about; but when lcatne toaea them dis-
tinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese em-

saw them, which was after we entered the wilder
part of the country. Our leader fix the day

ln putsuitofthis odd sort ol'game, it was
our hop to meet with about forty Tartan;
whether they were hunting mutton as we were,
or whether they looked foranother kind of prey,
woknownot; but as aoonasthey saw us,one
ofthevn blew a kind ol'horn very loud, but with
a barbarous sound that I had never heard
before, and, by the way, never one to hear
again; we all supposed thia was to call their
liiends about them, and so it was; for in lean
than ten minutes a troop of forty or fifty more
nppeared at about a mile distance; but our
work was over first, as it happened.

One oftho Seats merchants of Moscow hap-
penedtohe amongus,and assoonashe
heard the horn, he told us that we had nothing
to do but to charge them immediately, without
lo- ol'time; and drawing us up in a line, he
asked if we were resolved. We told him we
were ready to follow him; so he rode directly
towards them. They stood gazing at us like
a Ifiacrowd, drawn up in no order, nor show-
ing thofieaot'any order stall; huts: soon as
theygnw us advance, they let fly their arrows,
Whidt, however, missed us very happily: it
seems they mistook not their aim, but their dis-
tance; for their arrows all fella little short of

in chase got away. \Ve httd not a man lrilled
or hat; but as for the Tartan, there were
about five of ~thetn killed; how many were
wounded we knew not; but this we knew,
that the other party were so frightened with
the noise of our guns, that they made 06', and
never made any attempt upon us.

We were all this while in the Chinese do-
minions, and therefore the Tartar: Were not
so bold as nflerwards; but in about five days
we entered a vast, great, wild desert, which
held us three days and nights' march: and we
were obliged to carry our water with us in
great lenthern bottles, and to encamp all night,
just as I have heard they do in the desert of
Arabia.

I asked our guides whose dominion this was
in: and they told me this was altind of both

a part of Great Karaksthay, or Grand Taro
tary; but, however, it was all reckoned as
belonging to China, but that there was no we
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of
thieves. and therefore it was reckoned the
worst desert in thewholo maroh,thoughwe
were to go over some much larger.

Itad appeared in the way, about thirty miles
bcytnul the city.

This was very bad news to travellers; how-
ever, it was carefully done of the governor,
and we were very glad to hear we should have
a guard. Accortli gly, two days after, we had
two hundred soldiers sent us from a garristm
of the Chinese, on our left, and three hundred
more from the cityof Naum, and with these
we advanced boldly : the three hundred soitliers
from Naum marched in otIr front, the two hun-
dred in our rear, and our men on each side of
our eatnels,with our baggage, and the whole ca-
ravan in the centre; in this order, and well pre
pared for battle, we thought ourselves a much
for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if
they had appeared; but the next dav when
they did appear, it. was quite another thing.

It was early In the morning. when, march-
ing from a well situated little town, called
Change, we had a river to pass, which we
were obliged to ferry "and had the Tartan
had any intelligence, then had been the time
to have attacked us, when the caravan being
over, the rear guard was behind; but they
did not appear there. About three hours
alter, when we were entered upon a desert of
about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by
a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy
was at hand; and they were at hand, indeed,
ibr they came on upon the spur.

The Chinese, our guard on the from, who
had talked so big the day before, began to
stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked
behind them, which is acertain sign in a sol.-
dier that he is jinn ready to run away. My
old pilot was oftny mind; and, being near me,
called out, Senltor lnglese, says he, those fel-
lows tnust be encouraged, or they will mitt us
all; for if the Tartan come on, they will
never stand it.--l am of your mind. Said I;
but what must be done 3--Done'. says he,
let fifty of our men advance, and tlank them on
each wing, and encourage them; and they
will fight like brave fellows in brave company;
but. without this, they will every man turn his
back. Immediately I rode up to our lender,
and told hitu, who was exactly of our mind;
and accordingly filly of us marched to the
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest
made a line of rescue; and so we marched,
leaving the last two hundred men to makea
body by themselves, and to guard the camels;
only that, if need were, they should send a
hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a wunl,the Tartars came on, and an innu-
merable company they were: how many we
could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought,
was the least: a party ofthcm came on first
and viewed our posture, traversing the ground
in the front of our line; and, as we titund them
within gunshot, our leader ordered the two
wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was
done; but they wont OE, and l suppose back,
to give an account of the reception they were
like to meat. with; and. indeed, that salute
cloycd their stomachs, for they immediately
halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and
wheeling ofl' to the lefl, they gave over their
design, and said no more to us for that time
which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances, which were but very indifferent for a
battle with such a number.

Two days after we came to the city of
Nattn, or Naum; wc thanked the governor for
his care of us, and collected to the value of a
hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave
to the soldiers sent to guard us ; and here we
rested one day. This is a garrison, indeed,
and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here;

233

but the reason of it was, that formerly the
Musoovito frontiers lay nearer to them than
they now do, tho Musoovites having abandon-
ed that part of the country, which lies from
this city west (hr about two hundred miles, as
desolate and ttntit fiJr use ; and more especially
being so very remote, and so ditficult to send
troops thither for its defence: for we had yet
above two thousand miles to Musoovy, proper-
ly so called.

After this we passed several great rivers,
and two dreadful deserts; one of which we
were sixteen days passing over; and which, as
I said, was to be called no man's land ; and, on
the mm of April, we came to the frontiers of
the Muscovite dominions. I think the first
town, or fortress, whichct'cr it may be called,
that belonged to tho czar of Muscovy, was cal-
led Arguna, being on the west side of the river
Argunl.

[could not but discover an infinite satisfac-
tion that I was so soon arrived in, as I called
it, a Christian country, or, at least, in a coun-
try governed by Christians; for though the
Muscovites do, in my opinion, butth deserve
the name of Christians, yet such they pretend
to be, and are very devout in their way. It
would certainly occur to any man who travels
the world as i have done, and who had any
power of reflection, what a blessing it is to be
brought into the world where the name of God
and a Redeemer is known, adored, and wort-
shipped; and not where the people, given up by
heaven to strong delmioos, worship the devil,
and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones;
worship monsters,elemenle, horrid-shaped ani-
mals, and statues or images of monsters.

Not a town or city we passed through but
had their pagods, their idols, and their teln-
plos, and ignorant people worshipping even the
works of their own hands. Now we canto
where, at least, a face of the Christian worship
appeared; where the knee was bowed toJosus;
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Chris-
tian religion was owned; and the name of the
true God was called upon and adored, and it
made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the
brave Scots merchant I mentioned above with
my first acknowledgment" this; and taking
him by the hand, I said to him, Blessed be
God, we are once in among Christians.
He smiled, and answered, Do not rejoice too
soon, countryman; these Muscovitee are but
an odd sort of Christians; and but for the
name of it, you may see very little of the
substance fix some months farther of our

journey.
Well,saya l,but still it is betterthan pa-
ganism and worshipping of devils.--Why, I
will tell you, says he, except the Russian sol-
diets in the garrison, and afew of the inha-

"It: were now launched into the greatest
piece of solid earth, i" understand any thing
of the surface of the globe, that is to be hand
in any part of the world; We had, at least,
twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward;
two thousand to the bottotn of the Baltic sea,
westward; and above three thousand, if we
left that sort and went on west. to the British
and French channels; we had full ftve thou-
sand miles to the ludian or Persiansca, south;
and about eight hundred to tire Frozen sea,
north. Nay, if some people may he believed,
there might be no sen, northeast, till we came
round the pole, and consequently into the north-
west, and so had a continent of land into
America, the Lord knows where; though I
could give some reasons why I believe that to
be a mistake.

As we entered into the Muscovile domi-
nions a while bethre we came to any
considerable towns, we had nothing to observe
there but this: first, that all the rivers run to
tire east ; as I understood by the charts, which
some in our caravan had with them, it was
plain all those rivers ran into the great river
Yamour, or Amour; which river, by the na-
tural course of it, must run into the East sea,
or Chinese Ocean. The story they tell us,
that the mouth of this river is choked up with
bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz. three
feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I
must be allowed to any, I believe nothing of
it. but, as its navigation is of no use, because
there is no trade that way, the Tartan, to
whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing but
cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of, has
been curious enough either to go down to the
mouth of it in boats, or come up from tho
tnoulh ofit in ships,asfar as loan find: but
this is certain, that this river running east, in
the latitude of about fifty degrees, carries a

vast concourse of rivers along with it, and finds
attocean to empty itself in that latitude; so
we are sure of sea there.

Some leagues to the north of this river
there are several considerable rivers, whose
streams run as due north as the Yamour runs
east, and these are all found to join their
water: with the great river Tartarus, named
so from the northernmost nations of the Mogul
Tartars', who, as the Chinese say, were the
first Tartar: in the world: and who. as our
geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog
mentioned in sacred story. These rivers
running all northward. as well as all the other
rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident
that the northern ocean bounds the land also
on that side; so that itdoes not seem rational
in the least to think that the land can extend
itself to join with Antericaon that side, or that
there is not a communication between the
northern and eastern ocean: but of this I shall
say nomore; it was my observation at that time,
and therefore I take notice of it in this place.

We now advanced from the river Arguna
by my and moderate journeys, and were very
visibly obliged to the care the car of Mus-
cnvy has taken to have cities and towns built
in as many places as it is possible to place
them, where his soldiers keep garrison, some-
thing like the stationary soldiers placed by
the Romans in the remotest countries of their
empire: some of which that I had read of
were placed in Britain, for the security of
commerce, and lbr the lodging travellen: and
thus it was here: the wherever we came,
though at these towns and stations the garri-
sons and governors were Russians and pro-
fessed Christians, yet the inhabitants were
more pagans; sacrificing to idols, and wor-
shipping the sun, moon, andstars, or all the host
of heaven; and not onlyso, butvvere,d'all. 713' ,

the heathens and pagans that ever! met with,

the most barbarous, except only that they did

go; eat men's flesh, as our savages of America
I . .

Some instances of this we met with in the
country between Argunn, where we enter the
Museovite dominions, and a city of Tartar!
and Russians together, called Nertzinakoi, in
which is aeontinuod desert or forest, which
cost as twenty days to travel over. In a vil-
lage, near the last of these places, I had the
curiosity to go and see their way of living,
which is most hrutish and unsufl'erable: they
had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day; ibr
there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree,
an idol, madcof wood, frightful as the devil;
at least, as any thing we can think of to repre-
sent the devil can be made: it had a head not
so much as resembling any creature that the
world ever saw; ears as big as goats' horns,
and as high; eyes as big ass crown piece; a
nose like a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth
extended fourcornered, like that of a lion, with
horrible teeth, booked like a parrot's under
bill: it was dressed up in the filthiest manner
that you could suppose: its upper garment. was
of sheepskins, with the wool outward; a
great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two
home growing through it: it was about eight
feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any
other proportion of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer
side ofthe village; and, when I came near to
it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures,
whether men or women I could not tell, for they
made no distinction by their habits, all laying
flat upon
of shapeless wood:I saw no motion among
them anymore than ifthey had been alllogsof
wood, like the idol, and at first I really thought

'they had been no; but, when! came a little
nearer, they started up upon their feet, and
rahcdahowlingcryasifit had beensomany

they were displeased at our disturbing them.
Alittle wayoti' from the idol, and at the door of
a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-
skins dried, stood three butchersf--I thought
they were such; when I came nearer to them
I found they had long knives in their hands;
and in the middle of the tent appeared three
sheep killed, and one young bullock or steer.
These, it seems, were sacrifices to that sense-
less log of an idol; thethrea men were priest;
belonging to it, and the seventeen promoted
'wretches were the people whobrought the ofl'er-

ity aHbItItishworship of a hobgoblin that ever
1 was-at'any thing in my life; to see God's
most glorious and best creature, to whom he
hadgnnted somany advantages, even by crea-
tion above the rest of the works of his hands,
vested with a reasonable soul, and that soul
adorned with faculties and capacities ' adapted
both to honour his Maker and be honoured
by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so
very stupid as to prostrate itself to a. frightful
nothing, a mere imaginary object, dressed up
by themselves, and made terrible to themselves
by their own contrivance', adorned only with
clouts and rags; and that this should he the
effect of mere ignorance, wrought up into hel-
lish devotion by the devil himself; who, envy-
ing to his Maker the homage and adoration
of his matures, had deluded them into well
sordid and brutish things salons would think
should shock nature itsele

But what signified all the astonishment and
reflection of thoughts t thus it was, and I saw
it before my eyes, and there was no room to
wonder at it, or think it impossible: all my
admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to
the image or monster, call it what you will,
and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet
that wason its head, and out it in two;and one
of our men that was with me took hold of the
sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it;
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howl-
ling ran through the village, and two or three
hundred people came about my ears, so that
I was glad to scour for it, for we saw some
had bows and arrows ; but I resolved from that
moment to visit them again. _

Our caravan rested three nights at the town,

which was about four miles oil', in order to

provide some horses which they wanted, se-
veral of the horses having been lamed and
jaded with the bsdness of the way, and long
march over the last desert; so we had some
leisure here to put my design in execution. I
communicated my design to the Scots mer-
chant of Moscow, of whose courage I had suffi-
cienttestitnony ; I told him what i hadseen, and
with what indignation I had since thought that
human nature could be so degenerate; I told
him, if I could get but four or five men well
armed to go with me, I was ruolved to goond
destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them
see that it had no power to help itself; and
consequently could notbe an object of worship,
orto he prayed to, much less help them that
olfered sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me :--eays he, Your zeal
may be good, but what doyou propose to your-
selfbyit'l--Proposelsaid I; tovindimtathe
honourol'God,which isinsnlted by thisthvil-
wonhip .--But how will it vindicate the ho-
nourol'God, said he, whilethe people will not
be able to Iraow what you mean by it, unless
you could to thetn,endtell them an?
end then they will fight you, end bent you too,
I'll assure you; (q they etc duperate fellow,
and that especially in defence of their idolutry.
--Can we not, said I, do it in the night, and
then leave them the mesons and the causes in
writing in their own language ?--Writing!
said he; why there is not a men in five notions
of them that knows any thing of a letter, or
how to read in word any wsy.--Wretched
ignorance! said I to him: however. I have s
grunt mind to do it; perhaps nature may drew
inferences from it to them, to let them see how
brutish they ore to wordtip such horrid things.
--Loo|t you, sir, mid he, if your zeal prompts
you In it so warmly, you must do it; but, in
the next place, I would have you consider,
these wild nations of people are subjected by
force to the czar of Muecovy's dominion, and
if you do. this. it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of Nort-
zinskoi, and demand satisfaction; and if he
cannot give them satisfaction, it is ten to one
but they revolt: and it will min a new
war with all the Tartan in the country.
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my
head for awhile, but I upon the some
etring still; end all that tiny I was uneasy to
put my project in execution. Towerds the
evening the Scots merchant met me by occi-
dent in our walk about the town, and desired to
speak with me: Ibelteve, said he, I have put
yeuofl' your good design: I have been a little
concerned shout it since; for l abhor idolatry
as much to you can den--Truly, said I, you
have put it ofl' a little, as to the execution of it,
but you have not put it out ofmy thoughts; and
I believe I shall do it before I quit this plea,
though I were to be delivered up to them for
satixl'action.--No, no, said he, God forbid they
should deliver you up to such e crew oftnon-
stem! they shall nonlethal neither; thetwould

would they use me 'I--Uno you! said he, 1'"

He listened very attentively to the story; but

In s. word, finding me resolute, he liked the

bring ostorrt fellow, one of his may-nee, to

and I gave himal'ull amtofwhnt I had

me readily, he would gowith me if it oust him

had, indeed, proposed it torny partner, but he
declined it. He said, he was rwly to assist

my defence; but this "I! an edventure quite
out ofhis way; so, I say, we resolved upon our
work, only we three and my man-servant, and
to put it in execution thatnight about midnight,
with all the secrecy imaginehle.

However, upon second thoughts we were
willing to delay it till the next night, because,

we auppoeed the governor could not pretend to

in the morning among our fellow travellers,
exceedingly busy in getting ready for our
journey; nor could any man suggest that we
had been any where but in our beds, as travel.
lers might be supposed to be, to [it themselves
for the fatignes of the day's journey.

But the affair did not end so; the next day
came a great number of the country people to
the town gates, and in a most outrageous
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian
govemor for the insulting their priests, end
hurtling their Chant Chi-Thaungu. The peo-
ple ot'Nertzinskoi were at first in a great con-
sternation, for they said tho Tartan were
already no less than thirty thousand strong.
The Russian governor sent out masengefl to
appease tltem, and gave them all the good
words imaginable; assuring them that he
knew nothingof it, and that there had not a
soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it
could not be from any body there; hut if they
could let him know who did it, they should be
exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily,
that all the country reverenced the great Chant
Chi-Thattngu, who dwelt in the sun, and no

mortal would have dared to offer violence to '

his image but some Christian miscreant; and
they therefore resolved todenounce war against
him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians.

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to
make a breach, or to have any cause of war
alleged to be given by him, the czarhaving
strictly charged them to treat the conouered
country with gentleness and civility, gave
them still all the good words he could. At
'ast he told them there was a maven gone
towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it
was some of them who had done them this
injury; and that if they would be satisfied with
that, he would send after them to inquire into it.
This seemed to appease them a little; and
accordingly the governor sent after us, and
gave us a particular account how the thing
was; intimating withal, that if any in our
caravan had done it, they should make their
escape; but that, whether we had done it or
no, we should malts all the haste forward that
was possible; and that, in the mean time, he
would keep them in playas long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor:
however, when it cune to the caravan, there
was nobody know any thing of the matter;
nnd as for us that were guilty, we were least of
all suspected. However, the ceptain of the
caravan for the time took the hint that the
governor gave us, and we travelled two days
and two nights without anv considerable stop,

and then we lsyatavillago called Plotht:
nordidwe malteanylongetopherefimthastp
cued on towards Jarawena, another oftho our
of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected
we should be safe. But upon the second day's
march from Plothus, by the clouds of dust
behind us at a great distance, some of our
people began to be sensible we were pursued.
Wehad entered a. greatdesert, and had posed
by a great lake called Sehalts Oser, when we _
perceived a very great body of horse appear

on the other side of the lake, to the north, we
travelling west. We observed they went away
west, as we did, but had supposed we would
have taken that side of the lake, whereas we
very happily took the south side; and in two
days more they disappeared again: for they,
believing we were still before them, pushed on
till they carno to the river 'Udda, a very great
river when it passes farther north, but when
we came to it we found it narrow and fordable.

The third day, they had either found their
mistake, or had intelligence of us, and came
pouring in upon us towards the dusk ofthe
evening. We had, toour great satisfaction,
just pitched upon a place for our camp, which
was very convenient for the night; for as we
were upon a desert, though but at the begin-
ning of it, that was above five hundred miles
over, wehed no towns to lodge at, and indeed,
expected none but the city meena, which
we had yet two days march to; the desert,
however, had some few woods it on this side,
and little rivers, whichran all into the great
river Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between
little, but very thick woods, that we pitched
our little camp for that night, expecting to be
attached belbre morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were
pursued for: but as it was natal for the Mogul
Tartar: to go about in troops in that desert,
so the caravans always fortify themselves every
night against them, as against artniu of robbers ;
and it was theretbre on new thing tobe pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of
our travels, a most advantageous camp; for
we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet
running just before our front, so that we could
not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in
our frontor rear. Wetookcarealsotonnke
our front as strong as we cotdd, by placing
our packs, withourcamels and horses,allia
a lina,on the inside of the river, and felling
meueesin ourresre'mflml rum. [8"

In this posture we n' t;
hutthe enemy was uponmbet'orewehad
finished our situation. They did outcome tn
us likothieves,as weex'pocudflutunt than.
nasaengers to us, to demand the mentobe
delivered to them that had abused their priests,
and burned their god Chem Chi-Thaungu
with fire, that they might burn them with tire;
end upon this, they said, they would go away,
enddeusnofirtherherm,otherwise they
would destroy us ell. Our men looked very
blankatthiv ,andbegantostarest
one another, to see who looked with the most
guilt in their faces: but,nobotly wss the word;
nobodydid it. The leader of the caravan sent
word he wu well assured thst it we: not done
by any of our camp; that we were peaceable
merchants. tnvellingon our business; that we
had done no harm to them or to eny one else;
and thst, therefore, they must look farther for
their enemies who had injured them, (hr we
were not the people; sodesirod them not to
disturb us, for, if they did, we should defend
ourselves.

They were for from being satisfied with
this for an answer; and egreetcrowd ofthem
came running down in the morning, by break of
day,tootrrcamp; but seeingus insueh enun-
aecottntable situation, they durst come no for-
thcru'ren the brook inourfiongwhere theystood,
and showed us such a number that indeed ter-
ritieu us very much; for those that spoke least
of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they
stood and looked st us awhile, and then setting
up a. great howl, they let fly o cloud ofarvows
emong us; but we were well enough fortified
for that, for we sheltered under our baggage,
and I do notretnember thatone ofus was hurt.

Some time after this, we saw them move a
little to our right.snd expected thorn on the
rear; when a cunning fellow, a Comack of
Jerewene, in the pay of the Mmeovites, call-
in; to the leader of the convert, said to him,
I'll go send all these people ewey to Siheillts;
this wee a city four or five days' journeyat
least to the right, and rather hehindus. So he
takes his bow and arrows. and getting on
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly,
es it were beck to Nertzinskoi; sfier this, he
takes a greet circuit about, and comes directly

never heard any more of them,nor whether
they went to Siheillta orno. So we passed
away safely on to Jerawene, where there was
s garrison of Musoovites, and there we rested
five days; the caravan being exceedingly fati-
gued with the lest day's herd much, and with
went of rest in the night.

From this city we had s frightful desert,
which held us twenty-three days' much.
We furnished ourselves with some tents here,
for the better accommodating ourselves in the
night; and the leader of the esravan procured
sixteen carriages, or wagons of the country,
fix carrying our water or provisions; Ind
these Carriages were our defence, every night,
Mmd our little cemp; so that bed the Tester!

indeed, they would not have been able tohurt us.

we saw ebtmdanoe of the seble hun-
ters, who are ell Toners of the Mogul Ten
tery,ot'which this oountryisspart; and they
frequently attack smell caravan, but we sew
no numbers of them together.

After we bed this desert, weesmo

the our of Muscovy, with garrisons of Its-

peculiar to myself in all this country, which
I reckon was, from the desert I spoke of last,
at lens! four hundred miles, half of it being
another desert, which took us up twelve days
severe travelling, without house or tree; and
we were obliged again to carry our own wri-
aions. as well water a: breed. After We were
out of this desert, and had travelled two days,
we came to JcnezayJ a Muscovitc city or station
on the great river Janezrty, (Yenisey,) which,
they tultl us there, parted Europe from Asia.

Ht'rt: I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garri-
sons; all the country between the river Oby
and the river Janetay is no entirely pagan,
and the people as barbarous, es the remotcetol'
the Tenors; nay, as any nation, for lught I
know, in Aaiaor America. I alsol'ound, which
I observed to the Muscovite governors whom
I had an opportunity to converse with, that the
poor pagans are not much wiser, or nearer
Christianity, for being under the Muscovite
government, which they ecltnowledged was true
enough; but that, as they said, was none or
their btrsinese; that if the cur expected to
convert hie Siberian, Tongueee, or Tartar
subjects, it should he done by trending clergy-
nten among them, not eoldiers; and, they
added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that they found it was not no much the concern
of their monarch to make the people Christiana
as it was to make them subjects.

From th' river to the river Oby, we

of all manner of crimes; but neither were re-
lated to, nor concerned with, any of those vir-
tues that constituted us wise men, or of those
graces that distinguished us as Christians;
that being new deprived of all the fancied
felicity which he enjoyed in thefull exercise
of all those vices. he said he was at leisure to
look upon the dark side of them, whero he
found all manner of deformity, and was now
convitud that virtue only makes a man truly
wise, rich, and great, and preserves him in the
way to a superior happiness in a future state;
and in this, he said, they were more happy in
their banishment than all their enemies were,
who had the full ion of all the wealth
and power theyhad left behind them. Nor,
sir, says he, do I bring my mind to this poli-
tically, by the neceuity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but, if I know any
thiflg of myself, I would not now go back,
though the czar my master should call me,
and reinstate me in all my former grandeur: I
say,lwould no more gobaek toitthanl be-
lieve my soul, when it shall be delivered from
this prison of the body, and has had a taste of
the glorious state beyond life, would comeback
to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed
in. and leave heaven, to deal in the dirt and
crime of human afl'nirs. -

He spoke this with so much warmth in his
temper, so much earnestness and motion of
his spirits, that it was evident it was the true
sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt
his sincerity. I told him 1 once thought my-
self a kind of monarch in my old station, of
which I had given him an account; but that I
thought he was not only a monarch, but a great
conqueror; for that he that has got a victory
over his own exorbitant desires, and the ab-
solute dominion over himself, whose reason
mtirely governs his will, is certainly greater
than he that conquers a city. But, my lord,
said I, shall I take the liberty to aslt you a
question ?--With all my heart, says be. If
the doorofyour libertywas opened. eaidI;
would you not take hold of it to deliver you
from this exile 1--Hold. said he; your ques-
tion is subtile, and requires some sqrious,just
distinctions, to give it a sincere answer; and I
will give it you from tho bottomofmy heart.
Nothing that [know of in this world would
move me to deliver myself from this state of
banishment, except theeo two; first, the enjoy-
ment of my relations: and, secondly, a little
warmer climate: butt protest to you, thatto

the wealth, the gayety, and the pleasuresof a
courtier; if my master should send me word
this moment that he restores use to all he ba-
nished use from, I protest, if I ltnow myself
at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these
deserts, and these frozen lakes, lbr the palace
st Moscow.--But, my lord, said I, perhaps
you notonly are banished from the pleasures
of the court, and from the power, authority,
and wealth you enjoyed before, but you may
be absent too from some of the convenienwa
of life; your estttte, perhaps, confiscated and
your etl'ects plundered; and the supplies left
you here may not be suitable to the ordinary
demands of fifth--Aye. says he, that is as you
suppose me to he a lord, or a prince, kc. : so,
indeed, I am; but you are now to consider
me only as a man, u humancreature, not at all
distinguished from another: and so I can sufl'er
no want. unless I should be visited with sick-
ness and distempers. However. to put the
question out of dispute, you see our manner;
we are, in this place, five persons of rank; we
live perfectly retired, as suited to a. state of
banishment; we have something rescued from
the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps us
from the mere necessity of hunting forlhod;
but the poor soldiers, who are here without
that help, live in as much plenty as we, who
go into the woods and catch sable: and foxes;
the labour of a month will maintain them a
year; and. as the way of living is not expen-
sive, so it is not hard to get suflicient to our-
selves. So that nbjection is out of doors.

I have not room to give a full account of the
most agreeable conversation I had with this
truly great man; in all which he showed that
his mind was so inspired with a superior
knowledge of things, so supported by religion,
as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his
contempt of the world was really as much as
he had expressed, and that he was always the
same to the last,aswill nppearinthestory I
am going to tell.

I had been here eight months,anda dark,
dreadful winter, I thought it ; thecold so intense
that I could not so much as loolt abroad with-

daylight we had was, as we reckoned, for
three months, not above five hours a day, and
six at most: only that the snow lying on the
ground continually, and the weather clear, it
was never quite dark. Our horses were kept,
or rather starved, underground, and as lbr our
servants, whom we hired here to look attet

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRIISOE.

Ihatl would leave him to consider of it. and
wait on him ' III, and then I withdrew to my
0\\'I\ apflfu'lulil.

About two hours after, I heard somebody
at or near the door of my I'omn, and [was
going to open the door. but he had opened It,
and canto in. My dear friend, says he, you

1 had nothing III do but to acquiesce, and
'o professions to hi I of my having no end
in ll but a sIIICI-re desire to serve him. Ho
enIbI-arnl me very [mSSiollnlely, and assured
me he was sensible of that, and should always
IIowlI-dge It; and with that he offered me
at ry IIIIe present ofsables, too much, indeed,
Iilflllu to zttzt-IIpt from a man in his circum-
stances, and I would have avoided them, but.
he would not he re and.

The next morning I sent my servant to his
lofllshlp With a small present of tea, and two
pieces of China. damask. and four little wedges
of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above
six ounces or then-about, but were far short of
the value of his sables, which, when l canto
to England. I [bond worth near two hundred
pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece
of the damask. and one of the pieces of gold,
which had a tine stamp upon it, of the Japan
coinage. which I found he took for the rarity
of it, but would not take any more; and he
sent word by my servant that he desired to
speak with me.

When I came to him, he told me [knew
what had passed between us, and hoped I
would not move him any more in that affair;
but that, since I had made such It genomes
olfer to him. he asked me If I had kindness
enough to nil'I-r the same to another person
that he would name to me, In whom he had
a great share of concern. I told him that!
could not say I inclined to do so much for any
but himself, for IIhIIm I had a particular
value and should have been glad to have been
the instrument of his deliverance; however,
if he would plensoto name the person to me,
I would give him my answer. He told me it
was his only son; who, though I had not
seen him, yet he was in the same condition
with himself, and above two hundred miles
from him, on the other side the Ohy; but
that, if I consented, he would send for him.

I made no hesitation, but told him! would
do it. [made some ceremony in letting him
understand that it was wholly on his account:
and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I
would show my respect to him by my concern
for his son; but there things are too tedious
to repeat here. He sent away the next day
for his son; and in about twenty days he came
back with the messenger,bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which,
in the whole, amounted to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town,
but left the young lord at a distance till night,
when he came incognito into our apartment,
and h'u father presented him to me, and, in
short, we concerted the manner of our travel-
ling and every thing proper for the journey.

I had brought a considerable quantity of
cables, black foxskins, fine errnines, and such
other furs as are Very rich, in that city, in
exchange for some of the goods I had brought
from China: in particular for the cloves and
nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part
here, and the rest afterwards at Archangel,
for a much better price than 1 could have got
at London; and my partner, who was sensible
of the profit, and whose business more panic
cularly than mine was merchandise, was
mightily pleased with our stay, on account of
the traflic we made here.

It was the beginning of June when 1 left this
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of
in the world; and, indeed, it is so far out of
the road oi'commerco, that I know not how it
should be much talked of. We were now rc-
duccd to a very small caravan, having only
thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of
them passed for mine, though my new guest
was proprietor of eleven of them: it was most
natural also that I should take more servants
with me than I had before : and the young lord
passed for my steward; what great man I pse-
eed for myself} I know not, neither did it com
com me to inquire. We had here the worst
and the largest desert to pass over that we
met with in our whole joumey;l call it the
worst, because the way was very deep in some
places, and very uneven in others; the best
we had to say for it was, that we thought we
had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear,
and that they never came on this side the river

245

Oby, oratleanbutvery seldombtn "found
it otherwise.

My young lord had a firithfiil Masonite, or
rather a. Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country, and led us by pri-
vate roads, so that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road,
such as Tumen, Soloy Kunskoi, and several
others: because the Muscovite garrison! which
are kept there srevery curious and strict in
their observation upon travellers, and search-
ing lest any of the banished persons of note
should make their escape that way into Mus--
covy; but by this means, as we were ltept out
of the cities, so our whole joumey was a de-
eert, and we were obliged to erreamp and lie
in our tents, when we might have had very
good aocmnraodation in the cities on the way:
tltis the young lord was so sensible of, that he
would not allow us to lie abroad when we came
to several cities on the way, but lay abroad
himself, with his servant, in the woods, and
met its always at the appointed places.

We were just entered Europe, having pas-
sed the river Kama; which in these parts is
the boundary between Europe and Asia. and
the first city on the European side was called
Soloy Kamsltoi. which is as much as to say,
the great city on the river Kama; and here we
thought to see some evident alteration in the
people; but we were mistaken : for as we had
a vast desert to pass, which is near seven
hundred miles long in some places, but not
above two hundred miles over where we pas-
aed it, so till we came past that horrible place,
we found very little difference between that
country and the Mogul Tartary: the people
are mostly pagans, and little better than the
savages of America; their houses and towns
fitll of idols, and their way of living wholly barv
barous, except in the cities, as above, andthe
villages near them, where they are Christians,
as they call themselves, of the Greek church;
but have their religion mingled with so many
relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be
known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we
must (after all our dangers were to our imagi-
nation escaped, as before)have been plundmd
and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop
of thieves; of what country they were I am
yet at a loss to know, but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were
at first about lorry-five in number; they came
so near to us as to be within two musket-
shots, and asking no questions, surrounded as
with their houses, and looked very earnestly
upon us twice: at length they placed them-
selves just in our way; upon which we drew
up in a little line, before our camels, being not
above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up
thus, we halted, and sent out the Sibertan sch
vant. who attended his lord, to see who they
Were: his master was the more willing to let
him go. because he was not a little apprehen-
sive that they were a Siberian troop sent out
aficr him. The man came up near them with
a flag of truce, and called to them; but though
he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
of languages rather, he could not understand
a word they said; however, after some signs
to him not to come nearer to them, at his
peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he
wont; only that by their dress, he said. he be-
lieved them to be some 'I'artars of Kaltuuclt.
or of the Circassian hordes, and that there
must be more of them upon the great desert,
though he never heard that any of them were
seen so far north before.

About an hour after, they again made a mo'
tion to attack us, and rode round our little
wood to see where they might break in; but
finding us always ready to face them, they
went utfagaiu; and we resolved not to stir for
that. night.

This was small comfort to its ; however, we
had no remedy: there was, on our left hand, at
about a quarter of a trifle distance, a little
grove, and Very near the road; I immediately
resolved we should advance to those trees, and
fortily ourselves as well as we could there: for,
first, I considered that the trees would in a
great measure cover us from their arrows; and,
in the next place. they could not come to charge
as in a body; it was, indeed, my old Fortit-
gucsc pilot who proposed it, and who had this
excellency attending him, that he was always
readicst and most apt to direct and encourage
us in cases of the most danger. \Ve advanced
immediately, with what speed we could, and
gained that little wood ; the Tartars, or thieves,
for we knew not what to call them. keeping
their stand. and not attempting to hinder us.

\Vhen we canto thither, we found, to our
great satisfaction, that it was a. swampy piece
of ground, and on the one side a very great
epring of water, which running out in a little
brook, was, a little farther, joined by another
of the like size; and was, in short, the source
of a considerable river, called afterwards the
\Vinska: the trees which grew about this
spring were not above two hundred, but very
targe, and stood pretty thick. so that as soon
as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they attacked us on foot.

ADVENTURES OI' ROBINSON CRUSOE.

While we stayed here waiting the motion of
the enemy some hours, without perceiving
they made any movement, our Portuguese,
with some help, out several arms of trees half
oil". and laid them hanging across from one
tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in.

About two hours before night they canto
down directly upon us: and though we had not
perceived it, we found they had beenjuined by
some more of the same," that they were near
fourscore horse; whereof, however, we fancied
some were women. They came on till they
were within half shot of our little wood, when
we fired one musket without bull, and called
to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep elf: but they
came on with a double fury up to the wood side,
not imagining we were so barricaded that they
could not easily break in. Our old pilot was
our captain, as Well as our engineer, and de-
sired us not to lire upon them till they came
within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to
kill ; and that when we did lire, we should be
sure to take good aim; we bade him give the
word of command, which he delayed so long,
that they were some of them within two pikes
length of us when we let fly. We aimed so
true that we killed fourteen of them, and
wounded several others, as also several of their
horses: for we had all of us loaded our pieces
with two or three bullets at least.

They were terribly surprised with our fire,
and retreated immediately about one hundred
rods from us, in which time we loaded our
pieces again, and swing them keep that dis-
tance, we sailied um, and calched four or five
of their horses, w'nusu riders we supposed
were killed, and coming up to the dead, wo
judged they ware 'l'artats. but knew not. how
they came to make anescursion such an un-
usual len;th.

\V'e slept little, you may be sure, but spent
the most part of the night in strengthening our
situation. and barricading the entrances into
the wool, and keeping a strict watch. We
waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave
us a very unwelcome discovery, indeed ', for the
enemy, who we thought werediscouraged with
the reception they met with, were now greatly
inCreaSed, and had set up eleven or twelve
huts or tents, as if they were resolved to be~
siege us; and this little camp they had pitched
upon the open plain, about three quarters ofa
mile from us. \V'e were, indeed, surprised at
this discovery; and now,l confess. i gave my.
selfover for lost, and all that i had; the loss of
my etfectzt did not lie so near me, thtxrgh very
considerable, u the thoughts of falling into the
hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of
my journey, after so many difficulties and ha-
zards as I had gone through, and even in sight
of our port, where we expected safety and de-
liverance. A: to my partner, he was raging,
and declared that tolose his good: would be his
rttin, and that lie would rather die than be
starved ; and he was for fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh
showed itself, was for lighting to the last also;
and my old pilot was ofths opinion that we
were able to mist them all in the situation
we were then in; and thus we spent the day in
debates of what we should do: but towards
evening we found that the number of our ene-
mies still increased, and we did not know but
by the morning they might be a still greater
number; so I began to inquire ofthose people
Ive had brought from Tobolski, if there were
no private ways, by which we might avoid
them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some
town. or get help to guard us over the desert.

The Siberian, who was servant to the
young lord, told us, if we designed to avoid
them, and not fight, he would engage to carry
us off in the night, to a way that went north,
towards the river Petrou, by which he made
no question but we might get away, and the
Tartar: never the wiserzbut, he said, his lord
had told him he would not retreat, but would
rather choose to fight. I told him ho mistook
his lord; for that he was too wise a man to
love lighting for the sake of it i that I ltnew his
lord was bravo enough, by what he had show-
ed already : but that. his lord ltnew better than
to desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight
five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity
forced them to it; and that, if he thought it
possible for us to maps in the night, we had
nothing else to do but to attempt it. Be an-
swered, ifhis lordship,gave him such orders
he would low his life if he did not perform it:
we soon brought his lord to give that order,
though privately, and we immediately preo
pared fur the putting it in practice.

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark,
we kindled a fire in our little camp, which we
kept burning, and prepared so as to make it
burn all night, that the Tartan might con-
clude we were still there; butas soon as it
was dark, and we could see the stars (for our
guide would not stir before,) having all our
horses and camels ready loaded, we followed
our new guide, who I soon found steered him-
self by the north star.

After we had travelled two hora-a very hard,
it began to be lighter still; not that it was
quite dark all night, but the moon began to

247

rise, so that, in Ihort, it was rather lighter
than we wished it to be; but by six u'clodt the
next morning we were got about thirty milee,
having almost spoiled our horses. Here we
found a. Russian village, named Kcrmazinskoy,
where we rested, and heard nothing of the
Kalmuck Tartan that day. About two hour-
before night we set out again, and travelled
till eight the next morning, though not quite
so hard as before: and about seven o'clock we
passed a little riv--r, called Kinu. and came
to a large town inhabited by Rusians,
called Ozumoys; lhere we heard that several
troops of Kalmuclts had been abroad upon
the desert, but that we were now completely
out of danger of them, which was to our great
satisfaction. Here we were obliged to get
some fresh horses; and having need enough of
rest, we stayed tit-o days; and my partner and
I agreed to give the honest Siberian who
brought us thither the value of ten pistoles.

In five days more we came to Veuslima,
upon the river Wirtmgda, and running into
the Dtvina: we were there, very happily, near
the end of our travel:- by land, that river being
navigable, in seven days' passage, to Archan-
gel. From hence we came to Lawrensltoy the
3d of July; and providing ourselves with two
luggage boats, and a barge for our own conve-
nience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all
safe at Archangel the lSth ; having been a you
five months and three days on the joumey, in-
cluding our stay of eight months at Toholslri.

We were obliged to stay at this place six
weeks for the arrival of the ships, and must
have tarried longer. had not a Hamburgher
come in above a month sooner than any of the
English ships: when, after some consideration
that the city ofl-Iamburgh might happen to be
as good a market for our goods as London. we
all toolt freight with him; and, having put our
goods on board, it was most natural for me to
put my steward on board to take care of them;
by which means my young lord had a sufficient
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming
on shore ain all the time we stayed there;
and this he did that he might not be seen in
the city, where some of the Moscow mer-
chants would certainly have seen and disco-
vered him.

We then set soil from Archangel the 20th
of August, the same year ; and after no extra-
ordinary bad voyage, arrived safe In the Elbe
the 18th of September. Here my partner and

cluding about six hundred pounds worth ofdie-

Here the young lord took his leave of us,
and went up the Elbe, in order to go to the
court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek
protection, and could with those

ADVENTURES .0? ROBINSON CRUSOE.

To conclude, having stayed near fizur months
in Hamburgh, I came from thence by land to
the Hague, where I embarked in the pocket,
and arrived in London the 10th of January,
1705; having been absent from England ten
years and nine months. And here I resolved to
