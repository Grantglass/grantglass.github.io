Ronmsox Causes. was the son or

a respectable merchant in Hull. The

kindness of his parents had made his life very happy
His heart was not a bad one; but his love of idleness
and his thonghtlessncss gave his good parents a great deal
of anxiety. Instead of working and learning his lessons.
in order to become a clever man when he grew up, his
chief pleasure was to idle about the uays. Whenever
he did take a book in his hand, is thou hts were
always wandering away to the forest 0 masts in

the harbour. His one idea was to go to sea and

to make long journeys into distant countries;

chiefly because he hoped, by this means, to evade

the necessity for working and doing his duty. He

begged of his father to let him go to sea. But that
wort y man, who well knew the true reason of his

son's desire to travel, insisted I that he should
first lenm some occupation thoroughly,
.

and, when he had done that,

4>>his father would not stand in the way of his desires;
but that, unless he chose to work, he would itt
vain seek to be happy in this world. His father told
him: >> >> "If, however, you do. Itugntefully, quit your
parents, contrary to their expressed wish, you will cause them to
die of grief. We have already lost two sons and you are the last
child left to us. It is your duty to be a comfort and a support to
us in our old age. You know that [am no longer strong and
hearty. of one thing you may be quite certain --- no one who
despises God's commandments can
prosper in this world."
Whenever he had been thus talked
to, Routxsox would mend his ways for
a short time: but his thoughtlessuess
very soon caused him to forget the
rcmonstranccs and advice of his father, as
well as the tears of his mother. Foreign
countries set-med. to his mind, to he the
more delightful, itt proportion as his work
at home hccantc distasteful to him. As
ill-luck would have it. one day, when he
was lounging round the docks as usual, he
met a schoolft'llow who was about to start on
a voyage to London in a ship belonging tofather,

and who

u ed him to

come wit them. "if

the life there does not

please you, you can

but return to Hull!"

said his schoolfcllow.

This great temptation
RomxsoN could not
withstand. Therefore,
without for a moment con-
sidering the anxiety he would
cause is parents thereby, he
accepted the offer, and, without
sending word to say where

he was or what had be-
( > come of him, he quittcd
v, home. When, far out at

sea, he saw the church-

3 ires of his native town
disa peariug in t c mists of the evening,
he id feel some remorse: but it was then
too late: and with this reflection he tried to
satisfy his conscience.

Storm and Shipwreck.

Everything went well on the voy e,
until the sixth day, when they had cgfile
within sight of Yarmouth; but here they
were obliged to remain and to cast anchor,
in consequence of headwinds. On the eighth
day a very violent storm came on, and they
had to take in all the sails.

The wind roared and whistled. The

 

captain ordered the best bower anchor
to be let . ROBINSON became more
and more Eightened, and, to add to all
his miseries, he felt dreadfully sea-sick.
He clamheretl up, out of the forcastle, on
to deck, where a fearful sight met his eyes.
The waves were running mountains high and
broke from time to time over the ship. bury-
ing her in an avalanche of water. The
sailors, who went past him. had despair
written on their faces, and they pushed the
idler roughly out of their way. "is knees
tottered. His whole body trembled with
mortal terror, whilst qualms of conscience
tortured him: now, for the first time, he
be n to call to mind the warnings of his
fat or and the sorrow and anxiety he had
caused his mother. He bitterly and in truth
repented the step he had taken. He saw
that he was being punished for his wicked-
"C58.

The fury of the storm increased as the
day went on. Towards evening, it was found
necessary to lower the to masts. A dis-
masted bark drifted past t cm at a short
distance. Close to the coast, he saw a ship
founder, and, in the most abject terror, he
vowed that, if God would only save him
this once, he would return to his parents.
When midnight approached, a leak was dis-
covered in the bottom of the ship. The
water already stood four feet deep in the
hold. Everybody was ordered to hel
in working the pumps. The boatswain shoo
Roumson roughly, in order to awaken
him out of the kind of stupor into which
he had fallen. There was no help for it;
he had to take his tum at the pumps with
the rest. But notwithstanding all the exer-
tions that were made, the water kept on rising
in the ship's hold and she began visibly tosink. No other vessel that
could give them any help
was in sight. Signal guns
were fired every minute.
A boat was lowered; hut it
was immediately swamped.
Even the oldest and most
weatherbeaten sailors fell on
their knees and prayed God
to help them; but no prayer
came from ROBINSON s lips.
He felt that he was me--
rely suffering God's just
unishment for his sins.
vereome with dcs air, he
fainted away, and al wu a
blank.

Saved.

Suddenly ROBINSON felt
himself seized in a powerful

sp and dragged by main
orce into a boat. Some
brave men who belon ed
to a ship, which he ad
been unable to see, but who
were not too far away to
hear the minute guns, had risked their lives to save
those who were in danger. They had long fought in
vain against the wind and the waves; but at last the
storm stillcd a little. They were able to get near the
sinking ship and they succeeded in laying hold of
a rope that was thrown out to them. They were only
just in time. The kindhearted boastain had the thought-
fulness to pick up Rom-N50}! as he lay senseless on the
deck and to lower him into the boat. The whole crew
were taken off in the same way and thus saved. The
sailors now pushed off uickly from the fated vessel,
which only remained a ew minutes longer above the
water. Ronmsox raised a cry of honor a he saw
her sink. Fortunately, the sailors were able to force the
boat through the foaming breakers on to the beach,
where the whole of the party landed safely. Full of
joy and gratitude, the shipwrecked men thanked their
preservers. Some humane merchants, in Yannonth,
took care of the sufferers, rovidin them with food
and clothing and furnishing t em wit money to enable
them to continue their journey.

anxsox had here an opportunity of returning;
to his arena, who would have received him witr
joy anr afl'ection. The captain of the ship, now for
the first time, learnt that he had quilted home without
the knowledge of his parents and spoke to him very
seriously on the subject; but the sailors, who, after
they had been on shore a little while, forgot all about
the danger they had escaped from, made fun of
the milksop, whose courage had been so shortlived;
and their jeers caused RornNan toforgct all his good
resolutions. He accompanied his friend to London.The Voyage to the Gold-
Coast.

ROBINSON now wandered about London.
where the busy life intoxicated his senses.
His sole thought was how to become rich
without being obli to work as a sailor.

In the meantime, his small stock of
mone was very soon spent in amusement!
of di erent kinds with his ship com anions
and he began to feel the pangs of unger.
All at once. he remembered that a rich
relative of his mother lived in LONDON.
He told the kind hearted merchant the
whole of his story, without however men-
tioning the di ceful way in which he
had run away rom home. This excellent
man, who was under obligations to ROBIN-
soN's father for some kindness the latter
had shewn him, believed Routxsox's story,
and lent him twenty pounds.

A fortunate chance just at this time
caused ROBINSON to make the acquaintance
of a shipcnptain, who had lately returned
from Guinea. where he had done a good

stroke of business and who was on the point
of making a second voyage thither. He
offered to take Roamsors' with him on his
next voyage, advising him to lay out, in the
meantime, the greater Part of his ready
money in the purchase 0 glass beads, toys,
knives and axes; in order that when they
arrived, he might be in a position to barter
them with the natives on the coast for
gold dust and ivory. One fine evening in
autumn, the good ship HOPE put to sea.
with the truant on board.

Attacked by Pirates.

The wind being favourable. they soon
reached the Canary islands; when. one
mornin , the whole crew were called on
deck. he captain had for a long time been
watching a large, pirate-looking vessel.
which was coming, under a crowd of canvas,
in the direction of the HOPE.

The chase continued for nearly eight
hours. However the pirate kept creeping
closer and closer. until. at three o'clock in theEH

altemoon, he was within gunshot. He carried eighteen guns,
whilst thel'lon-I only carried twelve. Nevertheless the captain
of the latter was obliged to accept the unequal combat.
The entire crew, armed with guns, pistols and swords,
were drawn up on deck. The ca tain mused a broadside
to be fired as soon as he consi ered he had achanee of
crippling the pirate ship. For a moment she did swerve;
but then she suddenly succeeded in running close to
the HOPE and under a murderous fire of musketry she
threw grap ling irons on board. Notwithstanding that
the linglistmen fought like heroes the odds were too
large. and at last, the superior number of the pirates gave
them the victory. Five of the English crew, together
with their brave captain, having been killed and twelve
others being wounded, the rest, amon t whom was
Ronmsox, were obliged to surrender. II were made
prisoners and those who resisted were put in irons.

unmsox had fought with great bravery and he too lay
manacled in the hold of the ship. All knew that a ter-
rible fate awaited them. The next day the ship reached
ort and the prisoners were landed, as they alterwards
eamt in Sallee a town on the coast of Morocco.

RonmsoN in Slavery.

'l'he captives were at once oll'cred {or sale in
the slavemarkct. ROBINSON, being young and
strong, was, fortunately (or him, not sent up
the country. but was retained by the captain
of the pirates as his own property, and set to
do all kinds of useful jobs about the house
and garden. Although he was not actually
ill-treated, he was completely at the
mercy of his master, who could deal
with him as he leased and was
at liberty to 'II or sell him

at any moment.
RonmsoN, who had
formerly l'ound every
kind of work too
hard, wasand then-:3 oping down, as

proved feasib c. He lived in the hope t at the pirate captain
meiht perhaps take him to sea with him, and that then. a
ristian ship might defeat them, and thus he might regain
his liberty. But his master never took him when he went
on one of his piratical excursions.

As RomxsoN shewed himself to he a great adept in
the art of fishing, the overseer MULEY often took him with
him. One day his master proposed to go fishing with a
few friends. RomNSON was to get every thing ready,
to put plenty to eat and drink on board the ship's long
boat, as well as some fowling~pieces and gunpowder.
The arty werewfoing out to shoot sea-fowl, and ROBINSON,
toget or with Uuev and a boy named XURV. were to
accompany them. When however all was ready for .1
start, the friends sent word to say that they could not
go out shooting, but that they would come over and
spend the evening with the pirate. He therefore bade the
overseer take Romxsox and Xuxv and go out in the

boat to catch a good dish of fish for supper.

Ronmsou's Escape.

Scarcely had ROBINSON heard the orders that were
given, before a plan occurred to him by which he might
regain his freedom. He secreted a few tools and some
more food in the boat and started in good spirits with
MUu-'A' and XURV. The provisions for the shootin party

had also, fortunately, been left in the boat. When t ey got
outside the harbour, the set to work and cast out the nets,
but did not catch anyt ing. ROBINSON, who was looked
upon as the best fisherman, advised that they should go further
out to sea and handed over the rudder to XUKY. "Now
or never," he said to himself when he saw that they were about
a mile and a half from land. He stole quietly behind Muutt'
out in a stern voice: "if you

come near the boat I will

shoot you through the head.

for i am resolved to have

my liberty; but if you

swim to land -- the

sea is quite cairn --

you have nothing to

fear from me." At

favourable winds they conti-

nnml in this way for five days,until at last Roumsos considered himself
safe from pursuit.

He now cast anchor at the mouth of
a river, which he saw; for their store of
drinking water was exhausted. Towards
evening, they discovered'a bay where Ronni-
stm pm oscd that they should spend the
night. likt' noticed a lion sleeping under
a projecting ledge of rock. They cautiously
shoved the boat closer in shore and at last
Roumsox fired at the sleeping monster.
The first shot only wounded himY but the
second struck him in the head and killed
him. RomNsoN and Xunv then landed and

notice of these signals: but after a time it
was evident that she stopped in her course
and waited for the boat to come up.

ROBINSON and Xusv rowed with all
their might and after an hour's hard work
they at last succeeded in reaching the ship.
Joyfully they climbed on board. feelin at
last that they were safe from pursuit. A as!
their joy was not of long duration.

The Island.

On the next morning there arose an
cxcccdin y severe storm, which by the

evening ad grown into a hurricane. The
ship was tossed about by the waves like a

skinned their rey. Still Ronmsoa' did not
consider it adiiisable to go far into the in--
terior; therefore he turned the boat's head
for the sea-shore, where they arrived next
morning. Indeed it was fortunate that they
did so, for about mid-day Xukv saw a ship.
He awoke Rouman. who was asleep. What
a sight met his eyes! It was a splendid,
full-rigged European ship, with three masts.
ROBINSON sprang to his feet with delight.
He made the most vi orons exertions to
approach the new vesse and in the mean-
time he kept on firing off his gun. At
first the ship did not seem to take any

nutshell and was driven with irresistible
violence in the direction of the Caribbean
islands. For two whole da s they were
in the greatest dancer. n the third
mornin there suddenry arose the cry of
"Land filo!" But. at the same moment
also, the storm seemed to increase in
violence. The waves threatened every mo-
ment to swallow up'the ship. The upper
masts had been already sent down on deck
and as no sails could he kept hoisted, the
vessel could no longer be steered by the
rudder, but was driven about at the mercy
of the elements. Suddenly. she grounded,
and the waves made a clean sweep over
her decks. Nevertheless, the crew managedto launch their last boat.
They stru led with the
ene of es air inst
the'gyraging gatersmthat
threatened to engulph the
boat and drove it towards
the beach; whilst they saw
the remains of their late
ship become a my to
the waves. Sudden y how-
ever a huge breaker ame
rushing alon . A heart-
rending shrie was heard,
and, in an instant, the boat
as u t, whilst the men
it ha contained were hat-
tlin with the seething,
raging waters. ROBINSON
also went down with the
rest, but he quickly suc-
ceeded in getting up to
the surface in, where he
took a deep renth. in the

next instant, he was caught
by the following wave and i

w

dragged down below the water. Still

he had seen the shore and his lun s

were full of air, so he put forth all t e

strength he had left, in a vigorous endeavour

to reach the beach. At last he felt a severe

blow on his chest. He had been thrown upon

the surface of a large, flat rock and would have

been lost if he had not recovered his senses

before the followin wave came up to him.

He was just ab e, by crawling forward

on his hands and knees, clinging all the

time to every unevenness in the stone,

to reach a place of safety. But then

he sank back in a fainting fit which

lasted for some hours. At last con-

sciousness returned. He felt a wonderful

sense of happiness steal over him. He

knew that he was saved. But where was he?

The boat and the ship had both disappeared.

He alone was left. He tattered towards the top of

the clifl's, where, overcome with a sense of deep gratitude

for his escape and of joy at the scene around him, he fell

upon his knees and, with tears in his eyes, thanked the
Almi hty for his deliverance from so terrible a death.

Afi at once it occurred to him that, at any moment, wild
beasts or savages might come out of the forest and attack
him. His first thought was to fly. But where should he
run to? He looked round to see what he should do. Night
would soon come on. He fancied he heard the roaring of
some wild beast in the dismnee. His hair stood on end with

/fri ht. He possessed no weapon with which to
de end himself. He had saved nothing but the
clothes he had on. Every sound terrified him.
In this wretched state he passed the rest of the
day, and when night came on he climbed up
into a high tree with wide-spreading branches.
and thickly covered with leaves, where he sought,
amidst the foliage, to find a safe resting-place
for the night.

When Rolttxsox awoke the next mornin ,
his eyes rested upon the beautiful scene whic
lay spread out in all is glory before him; but
hunger and thirst made the first claims upon him,
and he felt ain and Stiffness in all his limbs. He
came down mm the tree. No living thin appear-
ed to be about, except a few parrots w ieh flew
screaming away. He was surrounded by an im-

peltctrab e thicket of bushes. Rare flowers hung

down from the trees over his head: but he
could neither find any fnlit, nor a spring of
water to quench his thirst. Suddenly he stop-

ped as if turned to stone. Only a few paces
distant from him. he saw. coiled round a tree-
stem, a huge snake. ln mortal terror he fled
from the spot. All his limbs trembled. The
dread of wild animals was now constantly before
his mind. He climbed one of the tallest trees to
look round. He found that he was on a middling-
sized island; but he could not see any houses,
nor any traces of smoke. A feeling of complete
solitude came over him. The sun new began
to be very powerful. so he took the wide leaves
from off a banana-tree and made himself a hat
out of them; and on the next day he constmcted
an umbrella out of the same material, in order
that he might have some protection from theintense heat of the mid-day sun. But above
all things it was necessary for him to
procure food and clothing. At last he
came across :\ cocoa-nut palm. the water
contained in the fruit of which served
both to still his hunger and to quench
his thirst.

His dread of exposure to the inclemen-
cy of the weather during the coming winter
season. increased daily. However. e dis-
covered a cave, which he thoroughly cleared
out; and although this cost him a great deal
of labour, it afforded him a lace to live in.
it was quite time that he id so, for one
night he was awakened from his sleep by
a dreadful storm of thunder and li htning
that was raging over the island. e was
almost stunned by one clap louder than the
rest. and he found that the lightning had
struck a clum of trees, -- fortunately stand-
ing separate ram the mass of the forest,--
and had set a dry stem on fire. In a
very short time all the trees composing
the group were in flames. Tongues of fire
shot forth in the darkness. Burnin branches
came tumbling to the ground, an the wind
carried a shower of sparks out seaward.
'l'his spectacle was very grand. but it gave
RUHINSUN an idea of how different a storm

'.

on his island was to those he had been
accustomed to at home. On one occasion.
when he was out hunting. he heard a sound
that was very familiar to him. it was the
bleating of goats. of which animals a lar e
herd soon ran past the place where ic
was hidden. Their hleating was a delicious
sound to his ears, as it led him to hope
that he might find some human beings on
the island. Filled with a longing for the
society of mankind. he wandered for days
about the island; but could not find any
traces of men, One day exhausted by his
exertions. he threw himself down upon the

und. But now again his ears were greeted
with the familiar sound of the whimpering of
a goat, which scented to him like a voice
from his own home. He forced his way
through the bushes and there he found an
old she-goat that had broken its le by a fall
and was trying to descend the cli . Having
only three legs she could not run very fast.
and ROBINSON easily overtook her. which
delighted him greatly. He carried her on
his back to where his cave was Here he
set the poor beast's leg and having tied it
up with a iece of linen torn off his shirt.
he prepare a soft bed of dry grass for the
patient to lie upon. The goat soon learnedto understand that he did not mean to do
her any harm, and became quite tame.

During one of his excursions. he had
come upon a very large herd of goats. and.
by following the prints of their footsteps.
he arrived at last at a spot where a pool
of salt water had been dried up by the sun.
and he became by this means possessed of a
supply of a condiment which he had so
long been obliged to do without in his food.

RutthSUX determined to invent a
means of catching some of the goats alive.
For this purpose he made a lasso. with
some long ieces of bass which he took
from one of) the trees on the island. and.
taking up his post on the road which the
goats travelled to go to the salt-lick. he
succeeded in catching a full grown she-goal.
A young' kid remained by her side. whilst
the rest of the herd tied in all directions.
ROBINSON ut the mother on his shoulders.
and carriet'i'her to his cave, whilst the kid
followed him like a dog. On his way he
was overtaken by a heavy storm. The rain
poured down in torrents. so that lie was com-
pletely wet through before he reached home
with his captives. lle :ttteluptqd to dry
his clothes. as best he could. at his fire: but
it was not much use. as he had no dry ones
to put on.

Rourusou's Illness.

During the night he awoke, feeling very
feverish, and when morninfi came. it was
I

with the greatest difficulty e was able to
make his way to the spring. By midday
he was much worse. and, the water being
all finished. he was tormented by a dread-
ful thirst. But now he was no longer capable
of leaving his bed. The fever increased front
hour to hour. His head seemed as if it
must split. so terribly did it ache. He tossed
about restlessly on his bed and dug his
hands into the sandy walls of his cave. The
goats came now and then to gaze at him,
as though they felt sorry for him. although
their bleating often disturbed him sadly;
still he could no longer even rise from
the place where he lay to go to them. He
might otherwise have quenched his thirst
from the distended udder of the mother
oat. A painful dread of thus dying of
runger and thirst tomrcuted him day and
night. He remembered how tenderly his
mother used to nurse him when he was ill.
Now she would watch for days at his bedside,
and how those dear parents. whom he had
quilted with such ingratitude. rejoiced at his
recovery. ln the raving: of delirium. he
seemed to see the figure of his father. bentdown with sorrow.and the face of his mother,

gale with anxiety. In his helpless solitude
e stretched forth his arms to them: but

they appeared to turn away from him. The
fever became worse and worse. his breath

came in gum. and his lips burnt like live

coals. In his terror, he tried to pray; but

the words seemed to die away upon his

lips. He felt that he was a miserable sinner,

and could not pluck up courage to call upon

God to help him. A frenzied despair took

possession of him. He looked upon him-

self as deserted by God and man: and al-

though he knew that his punishment "as

a just one. it was not the less terrible. What

troubled him most was that no one

would weep for his loss; no one

would miss him. His eyes

overflmved with tears, and

his heart was filled with

ml nitence. Invol-

untaglcy, his hands :

folded themselves, -

and he prayed God

that his sins might

be [0 iven him.

After is he fell

into a refreshing

sleep.and.when

he awoke, found

that the fever

had left him.

Recovery.

His recovery
roeeeded very slow-
i}; still, in a few days
he was so far conva-
lescent, that, with the aid
of a stick. he managed to go
dotvn and look after the welfare of his
goals. and to attend to their wants. How
delicious it was to take a deep draught
of the fresh. warm milk, which his goats
supplied in such abundance. He was soon
strong enough to take down some food
and water for his live stock. who had been
sufl'cring great privations during his illness.
The feeiing of Gratitude, which he felt at his
recovery from illness, enabled him now. to
submit. even to his solitary condition, with-
out rcpining. He had become a totally
altered bein . He had learnt to cast all his
care upon 10d, who had saved him from
such great dangers. He npidly regained
his strength, and was soon able to resume
his ordinary occupations. He determined

to make a thick hedge round his dwelling,
and for this pu ose he made use of the
prickly cactus. w ich he planted all round
the entrance to his cave.

Eruption of the Volcano.

A few days after he had finished plant-

ing this hedge, he was awakened by a

violent trembling of the earth. which continu-

ed throughout the whule day. and increased

in force. He became terribly alarmed, being

afraid lest he should be buried alive in his

cave. by the falling masses of earth. At mid-

day he observed that a mountain,

at no great distance. began to

give forth dense masses of

smoke and by the even-

ing the volcano burst

orth with terrific vio-

lence. A huge col-

nnm of smoke shot

up into the air:

thick showers of

sntrks and ashes

ell upon the is-

land: stones and

large masses of

rock were hurl-

ed front the cra-

ter to consider-

able distances.

The heavens be-

came darkened,

and a fierce storm

raged round the

summit of the .vol-

cauo. High, rocky

clifl's came tumbling

down with a loud crash.

The violence of the storm kept

on increasing. and the sea raged in all

its fury. Romssox fled into the interior

of the country. although he did not

know where to go for safety. as the

whole island seemed to tremble under his

feet with the violent shocks of the earth-

quake. Thus he hurried on, over hill and

dale. At last, thorou 'hly worn out by tenor

and exertion. he fel to the ground. He

must have lain thus an entire day. When

he again recovered consciousness. the earth-

quake and the eruption of the volcano were

at an end. He made his way back to his

cave, and found. to his delight. that it had

not suffered, though all around were to be

seen traces of the terrible storm that had
been raging.RomNsou's Household Occupations.

Romxsox's entire attention was now directed towards pro-
vidng :1 sufficient stock of wood tn last him, as fuel, through-
out the whole of the rainy season. which he now knew to be
approaching. The dry branches of the trees, which he found
strewed about. served his purpose admirably. and, with the aid of
a rough slcdve. which he managed to construct by tying together
some of the arger limbs of trees, he conveyed great quantities
of these branches to a projecting ledge of rock, beneath which
he piled them up. "is chief care now was to construct a proper
fireplace, so that his fuel might be used with as little waste as
possible.

He had discovered a bed of clay under the sand, not far
from the cave, and, with the aid of his wooden spade, he cut
out a number of pieces in the she of bricks. which he first
dried in the sun and then burnt in iis fire, With another kind
of earth, which he used as mnrtar. and these bricks, he built
for himself a regular fireilacc in the fore part of his cave, fur-
nishing it also with a c imney. l-lnw happy he was when he
was able to eat a piece of kid, which he had killed. and roasted
at this convenient fireplace. leaving the rest of the meat hang-
ing up in the chimney to smoke. so that it mi ht not go bad.
[\3 the heat of the sun kept on increasing, an all the folia e
became mrehed up, he felt convinced that the rainy season can d
not be ar off. He must therefurc now take energetic measures
for increasing his store of dried meat and fruits, as well as for
collecting a sufficient supply of food for his live stock. But the
first thing he did was to make a kind of hammock. so as to
avoid sleeping on the bare ground any longer. -After a at deal of trouble, he succeeded in weavin ,
with thin twigs ofl' the trees, some badly shaped baskets, whic
were, however. very useful for collectin heads of
maize, the fruit of the banana, and roots 0 the sweet
potato. To his great joy, one evenin he found
on the beach some very la e turtle. w ich he was
able to catch and whose esh tasted very good.
Besides which. their meat was not only excellent
eating when fresh, but kept very well when smoked.
Their huge shells also were of great sen'icc to
him for letting the goat's milk stand in. in ad-
dition to this, he was fortunate enough to catch
several young kids, which he added to his herd;
whilst his small stock of furniture, combined with
his cheery fireplace, made his dwelling look to a
certain extent comfortable. Soon after this, the
rainy season set in, and prevented him from leav-
ing his cave for weeks. This leisure he turned

to account by improvinfiihis household arrange-
ments in various ways. e made himself a better
umbrella, which he covered with the skins of
goats; so that it not only protected him from

the sun, but also from the rain. He was
now in a position to undertake longer ex-
cursions, without any fear of the conse-
quences of being caught in a shower. For
the steady downpour of rain had already
kept him a risoner in his cave for a whole
month. At ast. however. the rains ceased.
and the sun shone forth again in all his
wonted splendour.

     
 
   
        
 
    
 
   
   
   
   
     
         
 
      
 
    
 
   
   
   
   
      
    
   
 
 

  

Romxsox's Church.

After a short time. new life sprang up
all over the island, from the lately parched
soil. Tire trees put on a fresh mantle of
spring green and the valleys brought forth
a variegated carpet of flowers. The creepers
hun in graceful festoons from tree to tree,
an the joyous song of the birds resounded
through the forest. The sun poured its
life-giving rays from the deep blue firma-
ment, and the sea reflected. in its depths.
the colour of the sky. Both earth and

heaven seemed to have just come forth
from the Creator's hand. Even ROBINSON'S
downcast heart was awakened to a new lif ,
and was filled with gratitude towards a mere:-
ful Providence that had thus gloriously renewed
all things. He could not but feel that he was
not forsaken; that he had indeed been granted
a new lease of life. He felt that God was near
him, both in the howling of the wind and in
the roaring of the waves.
One lovely summer's evening, he was rest-
ing on a hill near the sea-shore, watching
the sun go down with a splendour he hanever before witnessed. Mov-
ed by the grandeur of the
scene and the solemn
silence which reigned
amund him, ROIKIN-
soN fell on his knees
and clasped his
hands in heartfelt
prayer. His soul
was moved to its
depths by a sense
nfthankfulness.aml
his eyes ran over
with tears. He made
a vow that, come
what might --- whe-
ther he ever saw the
countenance of a human
being again, or not -- he
would always resign himself
atiently to the will of God.
flue thought that he might os-
sibly regain the favour o the Al-
mighty. "ltich he had so justly forfeited,
comforted his mind.
livery Sunday morning he would come
to church to this hill, and it seemed to him
as though he could. on this s)0l, hold
converse more freely with his Mlakcr. and
was more absolutely in His presence. The
second summer passed away in this manner.

Further lmprovemcnts in his
Household.

RORINSON'S clothes were now almost
tom to pieces and only hun together in
tatters. It was therefore time t rat he should
contrive some means of making himself
new garments. \Vith the aid n his now
nearly worn-out knife he cut out some goat
skins, so as to make the parts ofa coat, and
sewed them together with thread that he
had manufactured from the bass of a tree.
His flock of goats had been increased
by many a fortunate capture. llut the
things he wanted most were some vessels
that would hold water, either for drinking
or cooking purposes. He formed several
pots of various sires, out of the clay he

ad found, and by degrees he learnt to
make them of the proper sha e. Then he
dried them in the sun and, :- er they were
dry, he burnt them in his fire. Still, the
greater part of them cracked, and those
that did not clack were not fit to hold any
liquid. At last it occurred to him that salt

is used to give a water-
proof glaze to pottery; and
aftera fcw trials, he actu-
ally succeeded in mak-
ing some pots that
would hold water. It
was quite a luxury.

when he again (as

Christmas.

la the meantime
his almanack, which
he kept with real
care by means 0 not-
ches in a long stick,
told him that Christmu
was now at hand; and
the thou In of this recalled
vividly to his mind his ling-
lish home and his dear parents.
The island looked most lovely in its
garb of delicate spring green. Yet how gladly
would he have exchanged all this for the deep
snow and severe cold of a northern winter, if
only he could therehy have purchased the
right to revisit his beloved home. Still, he
was determined that he would mark the day
somehow. He went out into the forest, where
he cut down a small tree. This he decorated
with candles made from the wax ofwild bees
and some tree pith which served for the
wicks. lie tried as much as possible to get
all his household work done beforehand.
and when C ristmas--eve came. he lighted
up his tree. which in its turn brilliantly illu-
minated. for the first time, the gloomy cave
in which he had taken up his abode. When
he looked upon these shining tapers, a flood
of recollections of his beloved home and
of his youthful days overcame him and his
pent-up feelings found vent in loud solis. He
went out into the open air. Herc Ire seemed
to be in the midst of one vast Christmas-
tree, the lights of which shone all round
him. His spirit went forth to the Creator
ofheaven and earth. He knelt down, under
that starlit sky, in fervent prayer, and a
heavenly peace seemed to steal into his
heart.

Domestic Cares.

To his great joy, the goat he had last
caught presented him with a couple of
little kids, which afforded him great amuse-
ment in watching their droll gmubuls. llcalso managed to increase his Rock by many
fortunate captures. in cleverly arranged pit-
falls. He was soon obliged to enclose a
large piece of ground for his goats, and
be one the rainy season came on again he
made them a shed in which they might
take shelter from the wet. This was the
first year in which he planted
anyflring for his own use, and

at the end of two months,

he had a splendid crop

of maize to reward his

pains. His household

um now in pretty /

good order. He

ad provided an 4";
ample store of

/

firewood. He had plenty of revisions laid
up, for himselfand his goats. l ence he found
leisure to reflect upon his position. He was
in filled with a longing for the companion-

5 ip of some human being. He would sit
for days doing nothing, and gaze out to sea
in search ofa ship; but this year also passed
away without any vessel coming in
sight. This made him very low-
spirited; and at last, a feeling of

wild despair came over him.

He forgot his vows, and

murmured a inst his

Heavenly l'ather for

havinv forsaken him,

and having condem-

ned him to live for

ever on this deso-

late island. All his

thoughts ran upon

the one idea of leav-

ing the island. He

determined to build

himself a'boat, and,

with the aid of fire,

and of an axe he hazl

made for himself out of

a sharp stone. he managed

to hollow out a tree stem,

which had fallen close to the

water's edge. Nevertheless. he was

obliged to acknowledge that a sail was ab-
solutely necessary to cnalrle him to undertake

so long a voyage: and as he had no hope of getting
one, he saw but (on plainly that his plans were useless.

RourNsON's Voyage.

A: last. however, he determined upon
making a voyage of discovery
round the island. He gave his

goats an ample supply of

food and water. He

put provisions

and waterfor himself into the boat. and as he had
a favourable wind. he shoved off from
land. The boat was, however, caught in
a current mnning out from the island; and.
notwithstanding the almost superhuman
efl'orts made by ROBINSON. he could not
force the boat a inst the stream. He was
now bein rapid?)f carried out to seat The
trees on t e island became more and more
indistinct, and, at last, the hills themselves
disappeared in the blue haze. A moml
tenor seized him. He could not tell how
he should be saved from dying of starvation
upon the open sea. A light wind now got
up against the current, and the boat began
to rock and roll terribl . Ronmsox really
did despair of saving Iis life. Lon ingly
he stretched forth his arms towards t e is-
land. where he had at any rate enjoyed
safety. liberty and the necessaries oflife.
Oh! i! he could only get back there once

more! He would submit to his late with
resignation and thankfulness; even though
he should be destined to remain in this
solitude for the rest of his days. Yes; but
now it was too late! l'erhn s within an-
other hour's time he woul become the
prey ot' the waves. l-'ear paralyzed his
imbs and parched his throat. The force
of the wind increased, He bitterly re-
gretted his want of gratitude to God. Who
ad so often mercifully protected him. and
vowed that he would never murmur against
His will, if he might only be permitted
once more to tread on dry land. By this
time night had closed in. All at once he
thought he could recognise a group of
trees upon the island! -- Yes, it was indeed
so. the wind had altered the course of the
current, and he had been brought back to
the island'without knowing it. In a very
short time he could recognise the trees

-%distinctly. They were those under which
he had made his church. He now took
up the cars with renewed vigour, and put
forth all his strength to reach the land.
His exertions were crowned uith success.
He was rapidly appmaching the shore. liut
it was necessary now to be careful lest the
boat should run upon one of the numerous
reefs which here projected into the sea.
He lalmured thus for hours and his strength
was frequently well nigh spent. But the
sight 0f the shore so close to him. always
revived his flagging owers. At last, he
succeeded in guiding his boat into a gentle

current which hrou ht him to land. With
a cry of joy he Jum ed out upon the
beach. He now felt tic firm earth under
his feet again. He thouvht himself in

Paradise. Tears of gratitu c flowed from
his eyes. lle knelt down upon the sea-shore
and returned thanks to God for having once
more saved his life. He remained thus for
about an hour. on tlte beach.

until he regained his

strength. -- Sud-

denly however

he started to

his feet. He

heard his

name

being called. "ROBINSON! where have you
been to?" All his limbs trembled. His
eyes almost started from his head, in the
endeavour to see, through the darkness.
who it was calling him. There. close by
his side, sat a parrot which he had caught
and tamed some time before, and it was he
that had called out his master's name. A
smile of pleasure passed over Rottmst \"s'
face as he recognised his feathered frient .
whom he had taught to Mk this question.
It seemed as though the very island was
glad of his return. He rose front the
ground and called to the bird, which at
once flew to him and settled on his hand.
where it had been accustomed to pore .
'rlere agai it put the question: "Rmnxstm!
where have you been to 3"" He now fastened
the [mat to the shore. and hastened through
the valleys to his cave. While he was still at
a distance. the goats set up a joyous bleat~
ing. as though they reeognised his foutste s,
and when he entered tie

enclosure they flock-

ed around him.

It seemed as

thou h he

ha been

absent for

weeks.Yet the fire, which he had so carefully
banked up with ashes before his depar--
ture, was still alight upon the hearth, His
cave seemed the most comfortable dwelling-
plaec he had ever been in, and he could not
imagine how it was possible for him to have
been discontented.

A h'lysterious Discovery.

Another year had passed away. ROBIN-
soN'S peace of mind, however. had not been
disturbed a%ain. His lon ing desire {or the
companions tip of some uman being had
given $1": to a placid contentment, a
peacefu resignation to God's will. Fear and
anxiety had no longer the mastery over him.

A mysterious discovery. however. was
now destined to overthrow. in one moment.
this disposition which had been acquired
at the cost of so much
time and ex n'ence.

One day, w en
he had made

<<33'
.,

a longer excursion than usual. he came to a
an of the island he had never before visited.
Vhilst walking quietly along the sand. on

the sea-shore. he stopped suddeniy as if

thunderstnlck. His lance fell from his hand.

He gazed fixedly upon a mark in the

sand -- it was the imprint of a human

foot! --- there could be no mistake about
it. He gradually came to his senses. He

did not fly from the spot. He knelt don-n

to examine the footstep. which pointed

in the direction of the sea. Trembling,
he looked all round him. For this mark
shewed that he was not the only inhabitant
of the island. The naked foot which had
made this print, must have belonged to a

' savage. Therefore, savages either lived upon

the island, or else they had come over from
the mainland and had landed here! But
it' they were savages, they might also be
cannilialsl Perhaps they

were, even now. hiddenin the woods and might spring forth at
any moment. He clutched his weapons,
while a nameless terror overpowered him.
The least sound startled him. He looked
about vacantly. When he had a in reached
the hi h ground, he dashed iul speed to-
wards is cave and when he
arrived behind the thick
hedge, he ventured for
the first time to
draw his breath
freely. But
the savages
would
be sure
to disco.

lace.
\ihither
should
he flee
so as
to hide
from
them?
Should he t"
destroy
his dwell-
ing?
Destroy
every
trace of
the la-
bour of
years. and
flee with
his ats
into cl'o-
rest? For
some time he
did not dare to
come out of his cave. l-'ear
had so completely gained the
mastery over his mind that he could not
collect his thoughts sufficiently to devise
any coherent scheme. He could no longer
sleep at night. In every sound he fancied
he heard men's voices. His late dependence
on God was again overthrown. *le never
considered that the Almighty. Who had al>>
ready saved him so often from danger. could
also protect him on this occasion. if it were
His good pleasure to do so. in the grey
twilight of the morning he would frequently
go up to the highest point of the island.
whence almost the whole country could be
overlooked: but. even from that obsen'atory.

he could see neither the wreck of a ship.
nor any signs of smoke. As weeks went
by in this manner. and no further traces
of human beings were visible. he re ained.
to a certain extent. his composure o mind.
He became more and more assured that
the footprint had been made, not

by any hidden inhabitant of

the island, but by some
savage who had come
over with a party
from the main land.
and had perhaps
been driven here
by stress of wea-
ther. but had

the savages
might come
back again
at any mo-

ment. and
what

3, should be

(it) then?

The most

necessary

thing to

be done

was to for-

tify his cave

better than

at present.

He construct-

ed a second

. wall or hedge

. - round it. by con-

necting by means

of stakes and wattles

the trees which he had

planted round it. The interior

wall he made stronger. and raised

it higher with earth and stones. Moreover

he planted a la e number of trees in a

hall' circle roun his cave at a little

distance from the second hedge, and be

tween these trees he planted some very

fast-growing bushes: so that within a

year's time, his dwelling place was sur-

rounded by a perfectly impenetrable thicket,

behind which probably no one would think
of looking for a human dwelling.

Whilst engaged in these daily tasks.
another year passed by -- the eighth since
he had been cast ashore. His dread oftbc
savages gradually wore ofl': so that he againundertook cautious excursions into the in-
terior of the island.

A Terrible Surprise.

One day. when thus wandering about the
island, ROBIN. N arrived at the swt where
he had first seen the imprint n a human
foot. and here he mounted one of the lower
hills near the sea shore. Suddenly he
fancied -- and his heart stopped beating
at the idea ~-- that he could see. far away
upon the waves, a buat bobbing up and
down. Whilst he was still can dering what
he should do:-- doubtful whether he could
trust his eyes; or whether it was really a
boat. full of savages. that he had seen: --he
observed a thin column of smoke. cu >>
u into the air from the be His hrst
it ea was to fly front the spa but as he
noticed that a number of birds were as-
semhled on the open sea-shore. he thought
he might take it for granted that no human
beings were there. He therefore crept
down to the place and stopped suddenly.
as if petrified with horror at the sight

which met his eyes. The beach was
strewed with human skulls and other
bones: in the midst of which the traces of
a still unextint uished fire were visible.
Shnddcring wit disgust. Rnnmsox stood
rented to the place. gazing at the relics ot
a feast which had evidently been held. not
long before. by those inhuman savages upon
this spot. Thoroughly horrified and sick-
ened. he lied to his dwelling. The boat
which he had seen had evidently brought
those cruel wretches to the island. Onliis
way home. he found. in several places.
distinct traces of human beings.

The memory of that shocking scene
haunted him day and night for a longtime.
The details were always present to his mind
in all their hideousness: whilst his rage
and fury at these fiends in human shape
were so great that he took the desperate
resolve --- if ever they should visit the island
again -- to attack them whilst they were
engang in their detestable meal and to save.
if ussihle, from their clutches some of the
nu ortunate beings whom they had destined
for sacrifice. He hoped that his mereappearance would suffice to terrify the savages. He made a number
of sharp arrows and practised himselfdaily in throwing sharp ed ed
stones. But for months he watched the sea in vain from his ill
top. He did not again see anything of a suspicious character, and
by degrees, a more peaceful frame of mind. and a pious resignation
to God's will, took possession of him.

The Crystal Grotto.

One day, as Routxsox was in the forest collecting dry wood to
burn it into charcoal, he discovered. in a thick bush that ran along
the face of the cliff. an opening in the rock \\ ich appeared to
become broader as it deepened. He crept on his hands and knees
into the hole. At last he found there was room enough. in the
cavern for him to stand upright and he felt his way further onwards
by means of his hands against the face of the rock. But he sud-
denly started back in terror: for. out of the darkness. he saw two
large eyes like coals of fire glarin at him and he heard a noise
as of some one groaning in pain. ark! were not those really the
words of some human bein in agony! Terrified beyond measure.

Rosmsox got out of t e cavern as quicklv as possible: but
when he again emerged into the dayligl . he plucked up
courage and was ashamed of his own cowardice. At any rate.
he would ascertain for certain whether these sounds were
uttered by a human being. He quickly provided himself

with a torch and. thus armed. rocccded to examine

the opening. Yes! there was the sound again! there

must be some sick person. dyin in there! RUBIN-

sox's hair stood on end. and a co d perspiration burst
forth upon his forehead. He plucked up all his
courage, and, commending himselfto the providential
care of God. he went forward. 'lhere --- there it
lay! and as he looked more closely he made out.
by the flickering light of his torch. an enormous.
hideous. old he-goat, which seemed at the point
of death. and. as is sometimes the case with wild
animals, had retired to this cavern to end its
days. The poor bnite could not rise upon its
feet: therefore ROBINSON allowed it to lie where

it was and went forward through a narrow
passage into the recesses of the cavern. All at

once he found himself in a hollow space some
twenty feet square. the walls and ceiling of

which glistened and shone like old and
precious stones. reflecting the lig t of his

torch in the most fantastic manner. He

had discovered a crystal grotto! The floor

was dry and almost level. He had sud-

denly come upon that which he had so

long looked for -- a place of refuge in

time of need. In this retreat. the savages

would not be able to find him. even

though they searched the whole island.

Next day he brought his stores andweapons here. in the mean
time. the old goat had died '
and ltumNsuN drag ed his
carcase, with muci diffi-
culty, out of the cavern.

A New Event.'

For a whole month. in-
cewtnt storms of thunder
and lightning broke over the
island. One night, during
which the incessant roaring
of the waves gave ROBIN-
s'ux but little chance of
sleep. he started up in his
hammock with a cry of sur-
)rise! lle fancied he had
ward the sound of a can-
nnu firing. \'e ' there it

' again! I ently a
signal of distress from some
vessel. K1 mmsux sprang to
his feet. The night was pitch
dark. l-lc clamhered. however,
smnehow, n to his hill-top, and
reached it Just in time to see
another flash, out at sea, which
was followed by the third report.
Evidently some ship was in the
greatest danger.

Towards morning the vio-
lence of the storm abated a little
and the sky gradually cleared. 0n
looking out seaward, RoumsoN

'9'
fancied he could discern a black
spot among the rocks. As the

' day wore on, and the sky be-
SS came clearer. he was able to make
out distinctly that a lar e ship lay
stranded among the roe s, and the
waves were breaking clean over
her. What could he do to assist
the unfortunate mariners? He re-
solved to get his boat afloat and --
no matter what exertion it might
cost him -- to put 08' to the
wreck. After getting his boat
afloat. he went up to the top of
the hill. once more, in order to
ascertain the exact direction in
which the wreck lay; when, shock-
ing to relate. the ship was no longer
visible. It had broken up! Nota
single living soul seemed to have
been saved from the wreck!
Exhausted with his exertions.
he went sadly home. 3 ill, as soon
as he had taken some necessary
refreshment, he went forth deter-
mined to make a further search.
Just as he stepped out of the
alm wood, on to the sea-shore.
e saw a magnificent dog. it
stood perfectly still and seemed
to gaze at him earnestly. RUIHN-
SON tried in vain to com the
animal to come to him, He ran
whining away, looking back, as
if he wished Roumsnx to fol-
low him. This the latter did and,
at last, the dog stopped close
to the dead body ofa cabin-
boy that lay on the beach.
All RmrmSnN'S exertions
to restore life to the bodywere in vain! The boy shewed no signs of returning
animation -- koutxsux had indeed found a human
being; but he was dead! He dug a grave in the
sand. and the dog stretched himself out upon the
spot where his master lay buried, which he could
not be induced to quit. Next day, however. he greedily
ate some bread. that ltumxsox ofl'ered him, and, after
several days watching, he was at last induced to follow his
new matter home. Ronmsox called his new friend Tuna.
and found in him not only a companion and friend, but
also a faithful protector of his property.

The Landing of the Savages.

About a year may thus have passed away, when, one
morninrv in autumn, as Romxsox climbed the hill just above
his dwefiling, he was terrified to see the reflection of a fire that
had been made on the beach. on the east side of the island.
not a mile away from his dwelling. He was even able to
hear the shouts and yells of savages. l-lis limbs were para-
lysed with fear. It was with some difficulty he saved him-
self from falling off his ladder. The sight that met his eyes
almost took away his senses. Some twelve lndians were
collected round a fire that they had prepared for cooking
their revolting meal. The tide had gone out. and three

mnoes were lying high and dry on the beach. It was
evident that more sava es had landed than were now
.. . visible round the fire. 'robably the others were roam-
ing about the island. They might therefore. at any
moment, discover his fortress. in femrish haste he
returned to his home, and taking his weapons in his
hand, determined to defend himself to the utmost
against these inhuman monsters. But listen as he
might1 not a sound was to be heard. He waited
thus for hours. in mortal terror the whole time; but

in vain. During this period of keen anxiety he raised

his thoughts to the Most High, Who had so often
before saved him in such wonderful ways. His ex-
citement cooled down to a certain extent. Still

at any cost he must put an end to this terrible
uncertainty. Again he nmnnted the hill, and.

laying himself llat upon the ground,crept a short distance fonvard. From this

point of observation, he was able to overlook

the place where he had seen the savages. They

were fourteen in number. They had just risen

from their meal and were dancing. with the

most wonderful springs and yells. around the fire.
which was on the point of going out. He could
follow every movement with the naked eye. The flood
title was now coming in. The cannibals, jumping up.
hastened to their boats; and. rowing quickly round the
point of the island. soon reached the open sea. where
they were dually lost to sight. Romssoa' uow ven-

tured to raise himself from the ground; but his peace
of mind was gone.

He was convinced that the savages

would come back again; that his freedom --

nay. more, his life -- was in the greatest

danger. For weeks he did not venture to go

beyond the enclosure surrounding his {or-

tress. His solitude seemed now doubly pain-

ful to him. His longing desire for the com-

mnionship of some human being had never
on so intense as it grew to be during the

year immediately following this event. -- The

autumn had come round again. One morn-

ing as RmnNsoN went out, armed as usual.

to look from the top of his hill round the

island. he obnrved --- and his heart scented

to cease beatin at the sight -- on the

small tongue 0 land. just beyond the

wood on the beach, where the little creek

run with incredible swiltuess towards his hid-

of rage, and three of them, armed with bows
and arrows. started after the fugitive. Roma'-
snx at once saw the dangerous aspect
which affairs had assumed for him. Now
the creek alone semrated them from him.
The poor fugitive eaped without hesitation
into the water and swam across the short
distance with great speed. Two of his
pursuers also sprang in after him: whilst
the third stopped. and returned to his eom-
rndes by the fire. The fugitive had by
this time reached the other side of the
creek. and lied towards the wood. but his
pursuers also came up out at the water.

amongst the trees.
Terrified by this
sudden and Wonderful
apparition, the savagestopped as if rooted to the ground, trembling in
every limb. ROBINSON no longer thought of him-
self, he sprang upon the first pursucr. and laid him
low with a single blow of his club: whilst the man
whom he had saved fell upon his knees before
him, and, raising his hands in a supplicatory
attitude, seemed to beg that his life might be
spared. The second pursuer now emerged from
the thicket. \\'hen lte saw the strange being, in a
suit of goat-skins. and his comrade lying dead on
the ground, he was full of amazement. {e quickly
adjusted an arrow to his how, but. too late! -- a well-
aimed shot from Roiuxsox's bow at this moment
put an end to his life. The savage who had heen
saved still remained on his knees. although RUBIN-
SUN tried by encouraging signs to reassure him,
and to invite him to come nearer. He seemed

to expect nothing less than death, and did not
dare to stand up. Roixmsox. observing this.

But the poor savage threw himself
upon his face. and placed the right
foot of his deliverer upon his neck,

in token of submission. ROBINSON
raised him up,.and held out his hand.
in the meantime, the savage who
had been felled with the club had
raised himselfup into a sitting xisture,
and gave a fearful yell. The iugitivc.
on hearing this sound. sprang to his
feet trembling with fear. Roulxsnx

RoiuNsoN lost no time in flying

to his grotto. his new friend follow-
ing in his steps. Once there he felt
more safe, for he was sure that the
savages would never discover it. The
night passed away in quiet. At dawn.
Romxsox left tlte cave. and made his
way to the top of the cliff to see
what had become of the savages. --
He was delighted to find that the
canoes were gone and no trace oftheir owners was to be seen. -- The savages had
evidently left the island.

RomNsoN's Young Guest.

When ROBINSON came to the grotto, where
he had left his friend asleep, the savage est
came out to meet him, and apin place the
foot of his preservcr on his neck. ROBINSON
raised him up. and contemplated with secret satis-

faction the well-knit and powerful 5 re of the man
whom he had saved. He called him "IuDAY, as that
was the day on which he had come to him. Tying
an apron of goats-skin round his waist, he took fitmn'
with him to the spot where the savages had lighted
their fire. With strongly marked gestures, to show
how revolting and disgusting the sight was to him. he
commanded FRIDAY to collect and bury the remains of the
bloody feast, which were strewed all around; after which he took
him to his fortress. FRIDAY could hardly believe his senses
do when he entered the hidden dwelling, and was shewn the
' various articles; such as he had never seen before. At
first. ROBINSON considered it advisable to make his guest
sleep in the outer rin of his fortifications, and to
barricade himsel in his cave with all his wea-
pons; as he did not think it prudent
to lace himself quite at the mercy
_- 2 ' x a? a savage, llut very soon all dis-
trust vanished, and he became
convinced of the faithfulness and
loyalty of his swarthy com-
panion.

Fruoav followed his
master about as a son
does his father. Roan:-
SON soon observed,
in the young savage,
not only a childlike
xx docility, but also
many other good
qualities; in ad-
dition to which
his admitncss
rendered him of
great use in tarry-
ing on the house-

hold duties.
Roumsox next
made clothes for his
companion out of goat
skins. It was very
amusin to watch
how is child of
the woods behaved
himself whilst put-
ting on these, to him,
foreign and most un-
comfortable articles.

/Still his self-esteem was much flattered
at being allowed to wear the same gar-
ments as his master. At first it is true that
he was very awkward in them, and
seemed to be deprived of all freedom
of movement, but he soon got accustomed
to the unusual restraint. -- He learnt with
surprising rapidity to understand what his
master said. and to re at after him a number
of the words ordinari y used in conversation.
ROIIINSON soon became very proud of his
npil, who proved to be most handy at all
'inds of work, and tried to anticipate every
wish of his master. FRIDAY. too, was very
happy at his ownra id progress, and it was
with proud delight! at e brought home to
his master any animal that he had killed.
if RonINSON did by any chance praise his
skill, FRIDAV would dance forjoy, and asmile
of pleasure would light up his whole face.
nhi st his teeth gleamed between his red lips
like a row of pearls.

The society of this wild son of nature
procured for RoIIINsoN many a pleasant hour.
and he thankfully acknowledged how merciful
God, in His Providence. had been in send-

ing him such a companion. it was a great
pleasure to RomNsoN to teach the young
stranger a few words of his own language.
and to watch his surprise and amazement
at the fumitnre and weapons which he saw.
Above all, however, the fireplace; the table,
and the chair surprised FRIDAY most. One
day, when for the first Iimc he saw the
violent bubbling and hissing of a pot of
boiling water, in which ROBINSON had placed
a piece of meat to cook, he was greatly
alamIed at this. to him, unusual sound. and
his master had much difficulty in preventing
him from trying to kill with his club the
animal which. as he thought, had come to
life in the wt. Nevertheless, when the meat
was boilc , t-'umat' soon learnt to partake
of it with great relish: although it "as
some time before IttnnNsoN could persuade
him to make use of a swan while eating.

But what delighted 'RIDM' most, was,
when he could astonish his master by his
dexterity in swimming and climbing. or sur-
prise him by the extraordinary acuteness of
iis senses of seeing. hearing. or smelling.
ROBINSON had also an opportunity of learn-ing many things from his companion, who proved to he a great adept
in capturing wild animals. He was never tired of watching FRIDAY'S
dexterity in shooting fish in the water with a how and arrows, or
the rapidity with which he would collect a large dish of cray-tish.

Roumsox as Schoolmaster.

There being new two mouths to feed, the field labour was
necessarily doubled; still it was only half as troublesome to
RolthsuN, since he had a com raniou to work with him, and
to whom he could impart his thoughts. which he had for so
many years been obliged to keep to himself. lie very soon
found that his as t could appreciate and enter into most of
his I eas. ltotilxsr. was very fond of telling his young friend
stories of his former life; matters concerning his linglish home.
the large towns, the domestic anangements and habits of his
countrymen: whilst he would watch the pe lexed amazement
and whet his desire for urther knowledge.
I'Rllmv soon learnt enough of his master's language
to be able to answer <<guestions respecting his former
savage life and that o the nest of his tribe. On such
occasions RUBIN also learnt many details con-
cert tg the supe titious faiths of the savages. their
gods and their ideas or a future life. RUIHNSON deter-
mined if povible to save his young friend from such
emynmns beliefs. When they sat together of an
eventing, re g from their daily toil, on the hill
which Run )N had used as his church. and the
latter talked of the works and nature of the
One l-Zternal (iod. he would often himself he
inspired with holy zeal. FRIDAY'S cars would
devour with avidity the words as they fell from
his master's lips. when he told him of the good-
ness and greatness of God. Who is everywhere
around us. Who created the world by His Al-
mighty power. Who orders and preserves all
things. Whose love and grace had been
manifested to himself in so many ways:
and when RUIIINSUS'S eyes glistened with
holy awe and inspiration. l'ktmu' would
be moved to fall at his feet and em-
brace his knees. The savage was never
. tired of hearing of the loving

_ ' ' ' ' better and greater than his own
cruel deities. And Ronmsox
himself felt that he became a
better and purer man after ha '-
ing, on such occasions. endea-
voured to instil into the human
soul entrusted to his care, ideas
concerning all that is holy
and good.

anThe Wreck and its Treasures.

The rainy season. which had in,the meantime set
in, was now nearly at an end. and Ronlxsux, who was
always considering how he could render his fortification
more and more secure. determined to build a wall inside
the hedge he had planted. FRIDAY'S part of the busi-
ness was to bring stones to the spot --- a proceeding which
was rendered all the easier by means of a kind of
sledge which ROBINSON had made, from fallen boughs
of trees, whilst the dog was pressed into the service
and made to help in drawing.

One very fine day, when they were both standing
upon a hill. on the south side of the island. the air being
remarkably clear, HUD/Iv all at once begant 'unip about
and to dance, calling out all the time: ere is my
country! There is my people!" Roaixso d steadily
in the direction pointed out. and inclement he too
could make out a very faint land line marked upon the
horizon. He turned to his companio - "Should you
like to return to your country, FRIDAY?" "Will you come
with FRIDAY?" was the reply. "Oh, they would eat me
it! came there!" said Romssox; but FRIDAY quickly
answered: -- "Oh no! there are white men, like you.
there. already.'

Romxsox hardly trusted his ears; still Wmav
repeated what he had saidy and. by dint of further
questioning. his master ascertained that there already
were, living amongst FRIDAY'S countrymen, seventeen
white men -- shipwrecked mariners, who had been well
received by the natives and had been permitted to
share their hard lot.

This was indeed an important discove ~! Ronmsux
at once resolved to build a boat which 3 ould be less
rickety than his little canoe. and capable of can'ying
them both over to the distant land. in order to join
these white men. He did not doubt but that his own
inventive mind. if combined with the aid of their strong
arms. would render it possible for them to devise some

means by which they might all return to Europe.
Ronmsox and his man at once set about buildin

a new boat, at which task hope more than double

their power of work. By the end of three months,

they were in a position to make a first trial
voyage. ROBINSON taught FRIDAY how to ma-
nage the boat. and how to steer. They had
even fixed the time at which they would start
on their trip. when an extraordinary chain
of events caused them to change their plan.
One evening. a storm of unusual violence
broke over the island. Next moming. the
weather having become fine. and it being,
according to their calendar. a Sunday.
Romxsux and his man went together to
the top of the hill which they called
their church. Arrived there. they both
uttered a cry of su rise: for there. at
the south end of rJ)": island and still
beaten by the roaring waves, lay the

wreck of a large ship.v

RoIthSON became as pale as a sheet. "Here;
he said, "is a ship that might have saved me: but
it must needs get wrecked !" I-'ollnwcd by the faith-
ful FRIDAY. he strode 00', at if in a dream, towards
the sea-shore. where he walked alnng the 21 id in a
southern direction. in the hope of finding snme
shipwrecked person who had been saved. But he
did not meet with a soul.

ltoluxsoh'. however. could not curb his impa-
tience to see what there was on board the vessel;

he therefore sprang
into the sea. as he was.
and swam to the wreck,
t'olluwcd by FRIDAY:

hanging duwn I'mui
the deck. enabling
them to clamber on
board. Without taking
mucl notice of littl-
DAY astonishment at
"the big huuse". as he
called the ship. R0-
HISSON at once pro-
ceeded to examine the
hold. as far as the
water would allow
him to go. .\'o

at these implements and

hesitate to appropriate

as they must otherwise,

back to the share and brought their boat round as quickly
as possible to the spot. loading her with such things as
seeiued most Valuable to them. When they had deposited
the first boatload on the shore, it occurred to Romxsox
that a shower of rain might come and spoil a quantit)r oi
the things: he therefore took the precautiuu of erecting
a kind of tent on the beach with the various )ieces 0f
saileloth that he had brought away with him. Whilst they

were thus engaged. night came on; but before entering

A Sanguinary Conflict.

ROBINSON was soon destined to find out the value
of the firearms. One morning, FRIDAY came in from the ~
beach, whither he had gone to fetch a turtle, with all the 0'3
signs of at alarm depicted on his countenance. Three 5
canocs ull of savages were a roaching the island!
ROBINSON quickly armed himsefi'pand his companion ---
who had by this time learned to handle a gun with V
great dexterity --- with three guns and a brace of
pistols each. together with the necessary ammunition;
and then, they both mounted the cliff to make their
observations. With the aid of the telescope, ROBINSON a"
was able to see that there were twenty-one savages, and - '
that they had with them three prisoners, one of 46'
whom was a white man! The canoes were appro-
aching the shore at a spot where the
bushes grew close down to the water's
edge, and Romnsox. with FRIDAY, made
all haste through the forest to get down
to this place. They found that the sa-
vages had already landed. Nineteen of
them were seated round a fire. One of
their prisoners they had by this time
killed and two of their number were
now dragging the white man from the
canoes OBINSON advanced very cau-
tiously towards them. and, when he
was near enough, gave FRIDAY the
word to "fire.' When the smoke
cleared away, it was seen that two
of the savages had fallen, whilst the
rest jumpe to their feet with evident
signs of terror. Two more shots, and
again two savages fell. The rest, who
were unhurt, rushed about wildly,
like mad creatures, shouting and yell-
ing. Three more were killed from the
ambush, before ROBINSON thought it
safe to sally forth, and shew himself.
FRIDAY and his master, shoutin
at the top of their voices, now rushe
out from their hiding place into the
midst of the savages, who fled in
all directions, endeavouring to
regain their canoes. ROBINSONtook out his knife, quickl cut

through the withies with w ich

the white man was bound,

and thmst a sabre and

pistol into his hands. By

this time some ofthe sa-

vages had recovered

their presence of

mind, and, headed

by a giant wielding

a huge club, made

an attack upon Ro-

HINSON'S party. Ro-

tuNsox and l-'RIDM'

again fired. and each

killed his man; but

the huge savage still

came on, making for

the white man whom

they had released. He

being weak and stiff, from

the manner in which his limbs

had been tied, strove in vain to

ward off, with his sword, the attacks of this
monster. The savage closed with his oppo-
nent and the white man would have been

lost, had he not made use of his
pistol. With the report, the giant
fell to the ground, and the other
could now assist ROIHNSON
with his sword.

The conflict was soon
over. Those of the savages
who succeeded in reach-
ing the <<noes pushed
0 {mm the shore in
two of them; whilst
ROBiNSON, with Fm-
DAV, jumped into the
third in order to pur-
sue the flying foe.
When, however, they
got into the boat, they
were su rised to find
in it a help ess risoner --
an old lndian a most dead
with fright and tied in such
a cruel manner, that he really
had very little life left in him. Ro-
BINSON at once cut his bonds and at this
moment FRIDAY -- whose attention had till
now been fixed u on the fugitives -- threw
imself at the feet of the
old man, kissed him, em-
braced him, hug him,
cried, laughed, olloaed.
jumped about, danced,
sang; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his
breast and head, and then
sang and jumped about
again like a madman. Fi-
nally he clasped Roms-
sox's knees, and when he
had come to himself: little,
shrieked, rather than said,

"This my father, Sir!"
ROIIINSON was not a
little surprised and delight-
ed to hear this. He helped
in rubbing and chafing theold man's limbs, which were stiff and numb
from the manner in which they had been tied,
and gave him a little rum to drink, to enable
him to hear being lifted on shore. There
ROBINSON also gave some refreshment to the
white man, who turned out to be a Spaniard,
and one of the shipwrecked men whom

ROBINSON and FRIDAY had for months been
making preparations to go in search of. As
the rescued men were incapable, owin to
the extent to which their limbs were we len,
of walking the distance to the cave, a kind
of litter was constructed, on which ROBINSON
and FRIDAY carried them; and very soon after
their arrival, they were fast asleep,

Next morning, the Spaniard related to
ROBINSON all that had happened to him and
his companions, from the day on which they
lost their ship, until the present time; after
he had heard all, ROBINSON decided that
the Spaniard, with FRIDAY'S father, should

take the boat, and to
bring theEuropeans over to this fruitful is and.

As soon astlley had started, ROBINSON
reflected that it would be necessary to make
provision for the large number of men who
would soon be living on the island. He
therefore set about sowing a la er crop
than any he had sown hitherto.--'l e things
he had saved from the wreck were very
useful to him in this He managed to put
together a very serviceable plough, to which
he yoked a team of four goats.

The Mutineers.

Early one morning, about a week after
the boat had one away, ROBINSON was ly-
ing asleep in his hammock, when he was wa-
kencd by the joyful voice of FRIDAY exclaim-
ing "Sir! they have come! they have come!"
Romxsox hurried up to the top or the dirt,whither FRmM' had preceded him. and there
he certainly could see a boat approaching
the island; but in a direction from which it

was hardly cpossible that the Spaniards should'

come. An moreover. as he made a sweep
round the horizon with his telescope, he
saw. far out at sea, a ship lying otl' the island,
in a south-easterly direction.

His first feeling of joyful hope that
at last an opportunity ofl'ered of leaving the
island. lasted but for a short time; as he
could see that there were eleven men in
the boat, of whom three were bound hand
and foot. and were lying side by side under
the thwarts. This strange circumstance
warned him to be cautious. Therefore he
armed both himself and FRllM'i', .and as.
judging from the direction in which it was
being steered towards the shore, the boat
would land just at the spot where the
wood came close down to the water's edge,
where the conflict with the savages had
lately taken place. they both of them made
their way down there. From this place
of ambush, they were able to see that
the three men who were bound were sitting
silent and dejected under a tree: whilst some

of the others, who were evidently English
sailors, appeared to be sleeping by the boat.
As there was no one else to be seen, ROBIN-
sox rightly supposed that the rest of the
party had ne to explore the interior of
the island. e therefore gave FRIDAY a sign,
and both of them crept down to the ri-
soners, who looked greatly alarmed w en
they saw two shange fi res, armed to the
teeth. come out of t e bushes towards
them. ROBIN: N, however. made signs that
they should remain perfectly still. and en-
uired who they were? The men answered
t at they were the captain, mate, and a pas-
senger belonging to the ship lying in the
offing. That the crew had mutinied. taking
possession of the vessel. and had at first
intended to kill their officers, but had changed
their minds, and had brought them to this
island for the purpose of leaving them there
in case it should prove uninhabited. Robin-
son at once promised to do all he could
to deliver them, if in return they would
undertake to carry him and his companions
back to Europe.
Xaturally this proposal was joyfully
accepted; ROBINSON released the three men\

from the cords with which they were bound and gave
each of them a gun with some ammunition. "Fortn-
nately. the villains have only brought two guns with
them," exlaimed the captain with glee; "and they
cannot escape us, as the tide has gone out, leaving
their boat hi h and dry upon the sand." All at once
voices were heard ap reaching. ROBINSON and his
party fired, directly t e new comers emerged from
the wood, killing two out of three; whilst the third
fell wounded. The watchers in the boat, as they had no
arms, ve but little trouble and were soon secured.

" 'e have been in luck," said the captain. "The
first and the last men who fell were the worst cha-
racters of the lot. The rest may be pardoned if they
will submit."

The prisoners were now bound hand and foot;
whilst the same course was pursued towards the
others, who came out of the wood later on, and were
taken captive before they had any clear idea of what
had occurred. Two of the prisoners who were de-
clared by the captain to he the least guilty were now
released from their bonds, and were furnished with
the guns that had been found in the boat. FRlDAY was
sent up to the cave to fetch some provisions: whilst
the rest of the party were employed in dragging the
dead bodies into the wood. When these preparations
had all been made, all hands ate and drank, waiting
for the next move on the part of those on board the
ship. Towards evening, several guns were heard from
the ship and then another boat was seen to shove off
from her side. There were ten men in her; and when
the captain could make them out clearly with the

These were, Ton FRY and WILL A'mms, the
boatswain's mate.

When the boat touched the shore, her crew

jumped out, and ran to and fro upon the beach.

shouting and holloaing for their missing comrades.

When they found the boat lyin deserted they could

not make it out. However, as trey got no answer to

their shouts, they went towards the wood, tiring

their pistols as signals. Suddenly a couple of

shots were heard. and two of the mutineer's

fell to the ground, killed by the bullets of the

captain and the mate. "Stand! and throw down

your arms, or you are all dead men!" cried

Roma-sort. The sudden fate which had he-

fallen two of their comrades intimidated the

others, who, in their terror, sought in vain

to make out where their opponents were

hidden. After a little hesitation, they saw

there was nothing for it but to obey; and.

one by one, they commenced to throw

away their swords and their pistols on

the sand. Roumsox now gave a sign,

and his small party -- seven men

against eight -- came out of their hid-

ing place in the thicket. "Remain at

, *1 glass, he turned to ROBINSON and told him that
X two of them were too dangerous to be spared.
K J '4'the present!" called Runmson back into the
wood, as though giving a parting word of
command to a body of men concealed there:
and this manoeuvre produced the desired
effect, for not one of the new comers attempt-
ed to make the slightest resistance to being
bound.

The Capture of the Ship.

The risoners were now taken for the
night to e fortress, whilst those who could
least be trusted. were confined in the crystal

lto. After holding a consultation with
t c captain, RUIHNSON offered most of the
prisoners a free pardon. provided that they
would place themselves under the orders
of the captain, and assist in recapturing the
ship. They gave the most profuse assur-
ances of their fidelity, whilst two hostages
were selected. who were to remain with
RoumsuN, and should answer with their
lives for the good behaviour of the rest.
The captain then waited until the next
evening when, taking with him ttvelve men,
of whom he put six in each boat, he
started for the ship. It was a tieklish mo-

ment when the watch on deck hailed
them and they had to reply; still they ma-
naged to disarm the'suspicions of those
on deck. The captain and the mate soon
reached the deck, and a couple of powerful
strokes from their cutlasses silenced the
watch. In the meanwhile, the crew of
the other boat had come alongside, and,
climbing on board, went forward to the
cook's galley, where they made prisoners of
the three men whom they found there. The
noise caused by all this awoke the rest of
the mutineers. A few heads appeared at
the foreseuttle. but they were as quickly with-
drawn, and all resistance in the body of the
ship ceased. The rest of the crew. after a
faint-hearted stru gle, soon threw down their
arms and yield ; and the firing of seven
guns, which was the signal agreed u n,
gave koumsox notice of the successo the
expedition, as also that the captain was again
master of his vessel.

Next morning, the meeting between
Robinson and the captain was most joy-
ous. and thankfully did the latter embrace
his deliverer. There lay the noble vessel,
and gladly would Roumson have at once
gone on board and set sail for Euro ,
but the mutely appealing looks of Fri ay
reminded him that he must still wait
awhile. The time which elapsed before the
return of the Spaniards was spent in ex-
plaining to his guests how ROBINSON had
managed to procure the means of living
on the island, since he had been cast away,
at which narration all were much entertained
and surprised. But a sad shock was in
store for poor FRIDAY. When the Spaniards
did at last return, he sought in vain amidst
their number for his father! The old manhad died on the return voyage to the is-
land! There was now therefore nothing to
kee FRIDAY from following ROBINSON to the
furt est ends of the earth. It was not with-
out a feeling or regret that Ronmsou tore
himself away from the spot where he had
spent eight and twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days of his life; where he
had passed eighteen ears in solitude and
labour, and where he ad learnt to become a
useful member of society. Seven of the S a-
niards, who were, at their own request, eft
upon the island to retain possession of it for
ROBINSON, stood upon t e beach waving a
farewell greeting to the fast receding ship.
on whose deck stood the "Lord of the Isle,"
with his dog by his side and his parrot on
his shoulder; whilst from time to time he
brushed away a tear, which would spring
unbidden to his eyes.

At Home again.

The voyage to Europe wu a prosperous

from their ten Spanish

However,
he at last
came
across a
cousin,

something

about him, and who

gave him an account of what had taken
place in the family since he had been away.

His mother was dead; but his father was
still alive. The cousin accompan'nd him and
HUDM', who, like his master, was now
dressed in European clothes, to the house
where RourNsou's father lived. "Here is
a gentleman who wishes to speak to you,
uncle !" were the words in whic he address-
ed a greyhnired, helpless old man, who
was sitting in an armchair by the fireside.
All at once, the supposed stranger fell at
the feet of the old man. and, grasping his
knees, cried in a voice broken with sobs: ---
"i am RonlNSON! your Ion lost son, Father!
but I am now quite a di erent being! Will
you not forgive me?" "Gracious God!" ex-
claimed the old man. "Bless you my son:
and thanks be to Thee, Heavenly Father,
that Thou hast allowed me to see this
day! Now I can die in ace!"

Great were the rejoicmgs in Hull when
it was known that Roltlrs'sor' had safely
returned; for the family were very much
respected in the town. The neighbours
flocked in to see the long lost son, and he

had to tell the tale of his adventures

over and over again.
