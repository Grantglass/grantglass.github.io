LIFE AND ADVENTURES
O F
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
 
1WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who fettled firfl
at Hull.—He got a good eilate by merchandife, and
leaving off his trade lived afterwards at York, from
whence he had married my mother, whofe relations
were named Robin fon, a very good family In that
county, and from whom I was called Robinfon Kreutz-
naer; bat by the ufual corruption of words in En-
gland, we arc now called, nay, we call ourfelves, and
write our name, Crufoe; and fo my companions always
called me,
A 3 I had
 
A D V E N TXT' R E S O F
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a lieute*
natit-coionel to an Engliih regiment of foot in Flanders^
fonn-V:, urn mantled by the famous Co-. Lockhart, rind
^ I'Sikd at a battle near Dunkirk, againit the Spa-
.maids, — What became of my fecond brother I never
!""»•*•„•, any more than my father or mo her did know.
'i was become of me.
Being the third fon of the family, nnd not bred to any
.i-ade, my head began to be tilled very early w.ih ram-
bling thoughts.—My father, who was very a'ncieut, brd:
given me a competent fhare of learning, as far as ho.iie
education, and a country free-fchoo! generally goes, «;nf
defigncd mc for the law; but I wt^ld be kaLiicd w:i;i:
nothing but going to (ea, and my inclination'to this led
me fo ilrongly agin 11 the will, aay, the commands of
my father, and againJl all the inireaties andperiuafions
of my mother and other fjlends, that there fecmed to be
ibmethiag fatal in that propenfion of nature, tending
drrecTly to the life of mifery which was to befal me.
My father, a wile and grave man, gave-me ferious
and excellent counfel again il what he forefaw was my
de/ign. —He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was confined by the gout, and expoilulated
very warmly with me on this fubject—tie afoed me,
what reafons, more than a mere wandering inclination,
I had for leaving ray father's hotife and my *.-alive voun «
try, where I might be well introduced, and had a prof-
peel of railing my fortune by application and indnftry,
with a life of eaie and pleafure.—He told me, it was
men of delperate fortunes on one haul, or of afpking
fu peri or fortunes on the other, and who went abroad up-
on adventures, to rife by enterprifc, and make them-
felves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the
common road; that thefe things were all either too far
above me, or too far below me; that mine was the
middle Hate, or what might be called the upper ilation
of low life, which he had found, by long experience,
was the belt (fate in the world; the moll fnited to hu-
man happinefs, not expofed to the miferies and hard-
fhips, the labour and fofferings of the mechanic part
of mankind, and not em barr ailed with the pride, lux-
ury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of man-
kind
 
 
kind*—He told me, I might judge of the happinefs of
this Hate by this one thing, viz. that this was the
itate of life which all other people envied; that kings
have frequently lamented the miferable confequences of
being born to great things, and wifhed they had been
placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the
mean and the great; that the wife man gave his tclli-
mony to this, as the juil ft and a rd of true felicity, when
he prayed to have neither poveity nor riches.
He bade me obierve it, and I mould always find, that
the calamities of life were Ilia red among the upper and
lower part of mankind ; but that the middle ftation
had the feweit difullers, and was not expofed to fo many
viciffitudcs as the higher or lower part of mankind;
nay, they were not fiibjecled to fo many clillempers and
nneafinefs, either of body or mind, as thole wcie, who,
by vicious living, luxury and extravagancies on one
? and, or by hard labour, want of n.cefTaries, and mean
or infuflicicnt diet on the other hand, bring dillem-
pers upon themleives by the natural confequences of
their way of living ; that the middle flation of life
was calculated for all l-:ind of virtues, and all kind of
enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the hand-maids
or a middle fortune; that tempcrence, moderation*
quietnefs, health, fociety, all ajreeable diverfions, and
ail defirable pleafures, were the "hie flings attending the
middle ilation of life; that this way men went filenily
and fmoothly thro' the world, and comfortably out of it';
not embarrafTed with the labours of the hands, or of the
head; not Id d to a life of Ha very for daily bread, or
harrafied with perplexed circumftancer, which rob the
*?ul °^Peace, and the body of reft; not enraged with
the paffion of envy, or the fee ret burning lull of ambition
for greaf things; but in eaiy circumftances, Aiding gently
thro' the world, and fen fib !y tailing the fweets of living
without thebitter; feeling that they are happy, and learn-
ing by every day's experience to know it more fenfibly.
After this he prefled me earneflly, and in the mofl af-
fectionate manner, not to play the young man, or to
precipitate myktf into miferies, which nature, and the
ftation of life I was born in, feemed to have provided
againft; that I was under no neceffity of feeking my

bread, that he would da well for me, and endeavour to-
enter me fairly into the jdation of life which he had
been jull recommending to mc; and that if I was not
very eafy and happy in the uorld, it mud be my mere
fate, or fault, that muit hinder it; and that he mould
have nothing to anfwer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning., nie again ft mealurcs which he knew
would be to my hurt.—In a word, that as he would do
very kind thing a. far me, if I would iiay and fettle at
home, as he dire&ed; fb he would not have fo much
hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encourage-
ment to go away; and to clofe all, he told me, 1 had
my elder brother lor an example, to whom he had ufed
the fame earneil periuahons to keep him from going into
the Low-Country wars, but could not prevail, his young
deiires prompting him to run into the army, where he
was killed; and though he faid he would not ceafe to
pray for me, yet he would venture to fay to me, that if
I did take this foolifli iicp, God would not blefs me;
and I would have leifure hereafter to refuel upon hav-
ing negle&ed his counsel, when there might be none to*
affift in my recovery.
1 obferved in this !aft part of his difcourfe, which was
truly prophetic,, tho' I. fuppofe my father did not know
it to be fo himfelf; J fay, I obferved the tears run down
his face very plentifully, efpec"tally when he (poke of my
brother who was killed ;• and that when he fpokeof my
having leifure to repent, and none to a hi ft me, he was
fo moved, that, he broke off the difcourfe, and told me,
.. his heart was fo full, he could fay.no morc.tv me.
I was fincerely afH'ded with this difcourfe, as indeed
who could be othenvife? and I refolved not to think
of going abroad any more, but to fettle at home accord-
ing to my father's defire.—But, alas 1 a few days woic
it all off; and, in fliort, to prevent any of ray father's
farther importunities, in a few weeks after, I refolved.
to run quite away from him —-However, I did not aft
fo haftily neither, as the hrft heat of ray refolution
prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I
thought her. a littlepleafaritextha»rordinary,and told her
that my thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the
world, that I fhoukl never fettle to any tiling with m%

folution enough to go through with it; and my father
had better give me his con lent, than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which
was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an
attorney; that I was lure, if I did, I mould never
ierve out my time, but 1 fhould certainly run away
from my mailer before my time was out, and go to fea;
and if me would fpeak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if 1 came home again, and did not like
it, I would go no more, and i would promife by a dou-
ble diligence to recover the dine that I had loft.
This put my mother into a great paffion: She told
me. Hie knew u would be to no purpofe to fpeak to my
father upon any fuch fubjedl; that he knew too well
what was my intereft, to give his confent to any thing fo
much for my hurt; and that ihe wondered how I could
think of any fuch thing, after the difcourfe 1 had had
with my father, and fuch kind and tender expreffions,
as ihe knew my father had ufed to me, and that, in fhort,
if 1 would ruin my felt", there was no help for me; but I
might depend I mould never have their confent to it;
That, for her part, fhe would not have fo much hand in
my dell ruction; and I fhould never have it to fay, that
my mother was willing, when my father was not.
Though my mother refufed to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterwards, that ihe reported all the difcourfe
to him; and that my father, after mewing a great con-
cern at it, laid to her, with a figh, that boy might, be
happy, if he would flay at home; but if he goes abroad,
he will be the mo ft miferable wretch that ever was born;
1 can give no confent to it.
It was not till a!mofl a year after this that 1 broke
loo e, though in the mean time I continued obflinateJ *
de*f to all propofals oflettiing to bufmefs, and frequently
e*A populating with my father and mother about their
being lb poiitively determined again ft what they knew
my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day
at Hulf, whither I went carnally, and without any
purpofe of making an elopement that time; but, 1 fay,
feeing there, and one of my companions being going
by fea to London, in his father's ihip, and prompting
me to go with him, with the'common allurement of a

feafaring man; that it mould coll me nothing for rnj
pafTage: 1 confulted neither father or mother any more,
nor io much as fent them word of it, but leaving them
to hear of it as they might; without a (king God's bl ef-
fing, or my father's; without any confideration of cir-
cumstances or conlequenccs, and in an ill hour, God
knows, on the fir it of September, 165 1, f went on board
a fhip bound for London, Never any young adventurer's
misfortunes, I believe,began fooner, or continued longer,
than mine: the fhip was no fooner got out of the Humber,
but the wind began to blow, and the fea to rife in a molt
frightful manner, and as 1 had never been at fea before,
I was molt inexpreilibly fick in body, and terrified in
mind: 1 began now ferioufly to reflect upon what I had
done, and how juftly I was overtaken by the judgment
of heaven for my wicked leaving my father's houfe,
and abandoning my duty; all the good counfel of my
parent's, my father's tears and my mother's entreaties,
came now irem into my mind; and my confeience, which
was not yet come to the pitch of hardinefs to which it has
been fince, reproached me with the contempt of advice,
and the breach of my duty to God and my father.
Ail this while the ftorm increafed, and the fea went
very high, though nothing like what I have feen many
times fince; no, nor what I faw a few days after, But it
was enough to affect me then, who was but a young fai-
Jor.and had never known any thing of the matter. 1 ex-
pected every wave would have fwallowed us up, and that
every time the fhip fell down, a3 I thought it did, in the
trough or hollow of the fea, we mould never rife more,
in this agony of mind, I made many vows and refo-
iutigns, that if it would pleafe God to fpare my life in
this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land
again, 1 would go directly home to my father, and never
fot it into a fhip again while I lived; that 1 would take
hij advice, and never run inyfelf into fuch miferies as
thefe any mere. Now I /aw plainly the goodneis of his
obfervations about the middle jtaticn of life, how cal'y,
bow comfoicably .he had lived ail his days, and never
bad been expofed to tem pells at fea, or trouble on
Chore; and, in fliort, I refolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
Thefe
 
 
Thefe wife and lober thoughts continued all the
while the itorm continued, and indeed iome time after;
but the next day the wind was abated, and the lea
calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it. How-
ever, 1 was very grave for all that day, being alfo a little
fea-fick Hill; but towards night the weather cleared up,
the wind was quire over, and a charming fine evening
followed, the inn went down perfectly clear, and rofe
lb the next morning; and having little or no wind, and
a fmooth fea, the fun mining upon it, the fight was, as
I thought, the molt delightful that ever I law.
I had flept well in the night, and was no more
fea-fick, but very chearful; looking with wonder upon
the fea, that was fo rough and terrible the day before,
and could be lb calm and fo pleafant in fo little a time
after. And now, kit my good refolutions mould conti*
nue, my companion, who had indeed inticed me away,
comes to me, well, Bob, fays he, clapping me upon the
fhoulder, how do you do after it? I warrant you were
frighted, were not you, la it night, when it blew but a
cap full of wind? A cap full do you call it f faid I, 'twas a
terrible ftorm. A itorm, you fool you I replies he. Do
you call that a Itorm r why it was nothing at all; give
us but a good fliip, and fea-room, and we think nothing
of fuch a iquall of wind as that; but you are but a frefti
water failor, Bob: come, let us make a bowl of punch,
and we'll forget all that, do you fee what charming wea-
ther it is now? To make fhort this fad part of my llory,
we went the way of all failors, the punch was made, and
I was made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickcdnefs 1 drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my pa ft conduct, all my refolutions for
the future. In a word, as the fea was returned to its
fmoothnefs of fur face, end fettled calmnefs, by the
abatement of that Itorm, fo the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehenfions of being (wal-
lowed up by the fea being forgotten, and the current
of my former defires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promifes that I made in my diftrefs. I found in-
deed fome intervals of reflection, and the ferious thoughts
did, as it were, endeavour to return again fomctimes;
but I fhook them off, and roufed my felt from them, a
 
 
it were from a di Item per; and applying myfelf to drink-
ing and company, loon ma lie red the return of thofe fits
(for fo 1 called them) and 1 had, in five or fix days,
got as complete a victory over my conlciencc, as any
young fellow that refolved not to be troubled with it,
could defire, But 1 was to have another trial fur it Hill
and Providence, as in fuch cafes generally it does, relol-
ved to leave me entirely without excufe; for if I would
not take this lor a deliverance, the next way to be fuch an
one, as the worft and molt hardened wretch among us
would confefs both the danger and the mercy.
The fixth day of our being at lea, we came into Yar-
mouth roads; the wind having been contrary, and the
weather calm, we had made but little way fince the
florin. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz,
at (outh-welt, for feven or eight days; during which
time, a great many fhips from Nevvcaitle came into the
fame roads, as the common harbour where the mips
might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not however rid here fo long but we fhould have
tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too frem;
and, after we hud lain four or five days, blew very hard,
However, the roads being reckoned as good as an harbour,
the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very ftrorig,
our men were unconcerned, and not in the lead apprehen-
live of danger; but fpent the time in re it and mirth,
after the manner of the lea, but the eighth day irl the
morning, the wind encreafed, and we had all hands at
work to itrike our top-malts, and make every thing thug
and clofe that the fhip might ride as eafy as pofiible. By
noon the lea went very high indeed, and our fhip rid
forecaftle in, (hipped feveral feas, and we thought once or
twice our anchor had come home, upon which our malter
ordered out the fheet anchor; lo that we rode with two
anchors a head, and the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible llorm indeed ; and, now
J began to fee terror aud amazement in the faces even
of the feamen themfelves. • The mafter, though vigilant ia
the bufineis of preierving the ihip, yet as he went in and
out of his cabin by me, 1 could hear him, iohly to him*
iclf, fay feveral times, Lord be merciful to us; we lhall be
 
 
all loll, we fhall be all undone; and the like During
thefe fir it hurries, I was fbptd, lying ftili in my cabin,
which was in the Ike [age, and cannot defcribe my tem-
per* I could ill relume the fir it penitence which I had fo
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myfelf again it:
1 thought the bitterness of death had been pail, and
that this would be nothing too, like the firft. But when
the mailer hi mi elf* came by me, as I laid juil no , and
faid we ihould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted: I
get up out of my cabin, and looked out; but fuch a dif-
mal fight I never faw; the lea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes: when J could
look about, I could fee nothing .but diftreis round us;
two mips that rid near us, we found, had cut their mails
by the board, being deep loaden; and our men cried
out, that a ihip which rid about a mile ahead of us, was
foundered. Two more fblps, being driven from their an-
chors, were run out of the roads to fea, at all adven-
tures, and that not with a mail Handing. The light mips
fared the bell, as not fo much labouring in the fea, but
two or three of them drove, and came clofe by us, run-
ning away with only their iprit-fail out, before the wind.
Towards the evening, the male and Loatfwain begged
the matter of our fhip to let them cut away the fore-
man, which he was very unwilling to do; but the boat-
fwain proteiling to him, that if he did not, the fhip
would founder, he con fen ted; and when they had cut
away the fore-mall, the main-mall Hood fo loofe, and
ihook the ihip fo much, they were obliged to cut her
away alio, and make a clear deck.
Any one mull judge what a condition I mull be in at
all this, who was but a young failor, and who had beea
in fucii a fright before at but a little. But if I can exprefs
at this diflance the thoughts 1 had about me at that time,
I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of
my former convictions, and the having returned from
them to the refoiutions 1 had wickedly taken at firil, than
1 was at death itfelf; and thefe, added to the terror of
the ilorm, put me into fuch a condition, that I can by
no words defcribe it. But the worll was not come yet j
the florm continued with fuch fury, that the feamen
themfelves acknowledged they had never feen a worfe.
We
 
 
 
 
 
We had a good fhip, but fhe was deep loaden, and wal-
lowed in the fea, that tlie lea men every row and then
cried out, fhe would founder. It was my advantage in one
refpect, that I did not know what tney meant by founder,
till I enquired, However, the ilorm was lb violent, that
1 faw what is not often feen, the mailer, the boatfvvain,
and fome others, more fenfibie than the reil, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment that the Ihip would
go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and un-
der all the reft of our dill re lies, one of the men that had
been down on purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung a
leak j another laid, there was four feet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that
very word, my heart, as I thought, died within me; and
I fell backwards upon the fide of my bed where I fat,
into the cabin. However, the men rouled me, and told
me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well
able to pump as another; at which 1 itirred up, and went
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was
doing, the mailer feeing fome light colliers, who, not able
to ride out the llorm, were obliged to flip and run away
to the fea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun
as a lignal of diilrefs. I, who knew nothing what they
meant, was fo furprifed, ,that I thought the fhip had
broke, or fome dreadful thing happened. In a word, I
was fo furprifed, that I fell down in a fwoon. As this was
a time when every body had his own life to think of,
nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man ftcpt up to the pump, and, thrulling me
a fide with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead;
and it was a great while before I came to myfelf.
We worked on, but the water increafing in the hold,
it was apparent, that the fhip would founder; and tho'
the ilorm began to abate a little, yet as it was not pof-
uble fhe could fwim till we might run into any port, fo
the mailer continued firing guns for help; and a light
fhip, who had rid it out juil a head of us, ventured a
boat out to help us. It was with the utmoft hazard
the boat came near us; but it was impofhble for us to
get on board, or for the boat to lie near the fhip's fide,
till at lail the men rowing very heartily, and venturing
their lives to favc ours, our men call them a rope over
 
 
the Hern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a
great length, which they, after much labour and hazard,
took hold of, and we haled them clofe under our Item,
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpolc for
them or us, after we were in the beat, to think of
reaching to their own ihip; lb all agreed to let her drive,
and only to pull her in towards more as much as we
could ; and our mailer pro rifled them, that ii' the boat
was itaved upon more, he would make it good to their
mailer: fo partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat
went away to the northward, Hoping towards the ihore,
almoft as far as Winter tonneffe,
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our fhip, but we law her fink: and then I un-
derstood for the firit time, what was meant by a drip
foundering in the fea. I mult acknowledge I had hardly
eyes to look up, when the feamen told me Hie was fink-
ing; for, from that moment they rather put me into die
boat, than that I might be laid to go in; my heart was
a? it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly
with horror of mind, and tae thoughts of what was yet
bt fore me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the more, we
could lee (when our boat mourning the waves, we were
able to fee the more) a great many people running along
rhe llrand to a flirt us wnen we mould come near: but we
made but flow way towards the more; nor were we
able to reach the lhore, till being pail the light-hoiife at
Winter ton, the lhore falls off to the weftward towards
Cromer: and fo the land broke off a little the violence
of the wind. Here we got in, and, though not without
much difficulty, got all fafe on more, and walked after-
wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were ufed with great humanity, as well by the
magillrates of the town, who aliigned us good quarters,
as by particular merchants and owners of lhips; and had
money given us iuriicient to carry us either to London,
m back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the fenfe to have gone back to Hull,
and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father,
an emblem of our bleffed Saviour's parable, had even
killed
 
 
killed die fatted calf for me; for, hearing the fhip I went
away in, was caft away in Yarmouth Road, it was a great
while before lie had any aifurances that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate puihed me on now, with an obftinacy
that nothing ecu Id re hit; and though I had ie vera! times
loud calls from mv reafon, and my more compofed
judgment, to go h ane, yet I had no power to do it.
I know not what to call this, nor will I urge, that it is
a fee ret over-ruling decree, that hurries iks on to be the
infbuments of our own defhuclion, even though it be
before us, and that we puih upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing hut fonie fuch decreed unavoidable
miiery attending, and which it Has impoilihle for me to
efcape, could have pnfhed me forward again ft the calm
reaionings and periuafions of my mod retired thoughts,
and agaitift two fuch vifible inftruclions as 1 had met
with in my Rril attempt. .
. My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the mailer's fon, was now lei's forward
than i. The flrll time he fpoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or thiee days, for
we were feparated in the town to feveral quarters; I fay,
the fir it time he faw me, it'appeared his tone was al-
tered; and looking very melancholy, and making his
bead, a fee J me how I did: and telling his father who I
was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,
in order to go farther abroad; his father taming to me
with a very grave and concerned tone, Young man, fays
be, you ought never to go to fea any more; you ought
to take this for a plain and vifible token, that you are
not to be a feafaring man. Why, Sir, laid I, will you
go to fea no more i That is another cafe, faid he; it is
my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you lee what a tafte heaven hag
given you, of what you are toexpeel, if you per fit; per-
haps all this has befallen us on your account, like jonah,
in the fhip of i arfhiih. Pray, continues he, what are you?
and on what account did you go to fea? Upon that I
told him fome of mv fiory; at the end of which he burll
out with a ibange kind cfpaffion, What had 1 done, fays
he, that fuch an unhappy wretch mould come into my
fhip! I would notfet my loot in the fame fliip with thee
 
 
again for a thoufand pounds: this indeed was, as 1 faid,
an exciirfioii of his fpirits, which were yet agitated by
the fenfe of his lofs, and was further than he could have
authority to go: however, he afterward.-) talked very
gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my fathers
and not tempt Froviucr.ce to my ruin:' told me, 1 might
fee a vifiblc hand of heaven againil me ; and young man,
faid he, depend upon it, if you Jo no: go back, where ever
you go,)OU will meet with nothing but di fa Her sand di {ap-
pointments, till your father's worcL are fulfilled upon you.
Wc parted foon after; for i made him little aiifwer,
and I faw him no more; which way he went, I know
not. As for me, having fome money in my pocket, I tra-
velled to London by land, and there, as well as on the road,
had many itruggles with myfeif what courfe of life i
iliould take, and whether 1 mould go home, or go to lea.
As to going home, fhame op poled the bed; motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occur*
red to me how 1 ihould be laughed at among the neigh-
bours, and ihould be .aftiamed to fee, not my father and
mother only, but even every body elfe; from whence I
have fince often obierved, how incongruous arid irrati-
onal the common temper of mankind is, efpecially of
youth, to that reaion that ought to guide them in luch
cafes; viz. That they are not afhamcd to fin, and yet
are ainamed to repent: not afhamed'of the action, for
which they ought juioy to be eiteemed fools; but are
aftiamed of the returning, which only can make them
eftcemed wife men.
In this If ate of life, however, T remained fome time,
uncertain what meafures to take, and what courfe of
life to lead. An ir efiitible reluctance continued to
going home: and as I ihv.d awhiie, the remembrance of
the diftrefs I had been in wore off; and as that abated,
the little motion I had in my dell res to return, wore ofF
with it, till at lair I quite laid a fide the thoughts of it,
and looked out for a voyage.
That evil infl uence, which carried me fir ft away
from my father's houfe, which hurried me into the wild
and indigeiied notion of railing my fortune, and that
imprefled thofe conceits fo forcibly upon me, as to make
me deaf to all good advice, and to the intreaties, and
even
 
 
 
even the commands, of my father: I fay, the fame in-
fluence, whatever it was, prefented the moil unfortunate
of all enterprifes to my view; and I went on board a
vefiel bound to the coait of Africa, or, as our failors
vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all thefe adven-
tures I did not mip myfelfas a fnilor; whereby though I
might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary,
yet at the fame time I had learned the duty and office of
a toremaftman ; and in time might have qualified myfelf
for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a mailer. But as it
was always my fate to chufe for the vvorfe, fo I did
here; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes
on my back, I would always go on board in the habit
of a gentleman; and fo I neither had any bufinefs in
the fhip, nor learned to do any.
It was my lot firft of all to fall into pretty good com-
pany in London, which does not always happen to fuch
loofe and ungjided young fellows as 1 then was; the de-
vil generally not omitting to lay fomefnare for them very
early; but it was not fo with me: I firft fell acquainted
with the mafler of a mip who had been on the coait of
Guinea, and who, having had very good fuccefs there,
was revived to go again; this captain, taking a fancy
to my converfation, which was not difagreeable at that
time, hearing me fay I ha j a mind to fee the world,
told me, if I would go the voyage with him, I fnoukl be
at no expence; I mould be his meflmate, and his com-
panion, and if 1 could carry any thing with me, I Iho ild
have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit;
and perhaps I might meet with fome encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a Uriel friend-
mip with this captain, who was an honcft plain dealing
mai, went the voyage wich him, and carried a fmail
adventure with me, which, by the difinterefted honefty of
my friend, the captain, I increafed very confi lerably;
fori carried about 40I. in fuch toyt and trifles as the
captain directed me to buy. This 401.1 had muitercd
together by the affiftance of fome of my relations, whom
I correfponded with, and who, I believe, got my father*
©r at leail, my mother, to contribute fo much as that, to
Miy firft adventure.
This.
 
This was the only voyage which I may fay was fuc-
eelsful in ail my adventuies, and which I owe to the in-
tegrity and honelly of my iiiend, the captain; under
whom I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics,
and the roles of navigation; learned how to keep an
account of the ftmAs courfe, take an obfervatzon, and
in ihon, to underlland 'ome things that weie neediui to
be undeniood by a faiior; for, as he took delight to
introduce me, I took delight to learn; and,, in a word,
this voyage made inc both a faiior and a merchant' for
I brought home rive pounds nine ounces oi gold-dull i'or
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my re-
turn, aimed 3col. and thL filled me with thole alpiring
thoughts which have fmce fa compleated my ruin.
Vet, even in this voyage, 1 had misfortunes tco;
paiticulai ly that 1 was continually fick, being thrown
into a violent calenture by tlie exec (live heat of the cli-
mate; our principal trading being upon the con ft, from
the hit. of 15 degrees N. even to the line itftlf,
! was nowj't up for a Guinea trader; and my friend,
to my great misfortune, dying foon after his arrival, I
refolved to go the fame voyage again; and I embarked
in the fame vcfi'ei with one who was his mate in .he
former voyage, and had now ot>t the command of the
illip This was the unhappu-ji voyage that ever man
made; tor though 1 did not carry <ja;te tool, t;f my
new gained wealth, h ihat I had 20ci. left, and which
I lodged with my friend's widow, who war- very juft to
me, yet i fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the fu ll was this; viz. Our fhip, making her courfe
towards the Canary iiLmds, or rather between thofe
i (lands and the African Hi ore, was furprifed in the grey
of the morning by a Moonfh rover of Sal lee, who gave
chace to us with all the fail fhe could make, We
crouded alfo as much canvas as our yards would fprtad,
or our mails carry, to have got clear; but rinding the
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our fhip
having twelve guns and the rover eighteen. About
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and, bring-
ing to, by mi Hake, juil athwart our quarter, in Head of
athwart our item, as he intended, we brought eight of
our'
 
 
our guns to bear on that fide, and poured in a broadftde
upon him, which maue him fheer cfr again, after return-
ing our fire,- and pouring in alio hu. frnall lliot from near
200 men which he had on board. However, we had
not a man touched, all our men keeping dole: he pre-
pared to attack us again, and we to defendourfelves; but,
laying us on board the next time upon our outer quarter,
he entered 90 men upon our decks, who immediately fell
to cutting and hacking the decks and ringing. We piled
them with imail mot, half pikes, powder c hells, and
fueh like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How-
ever, to cut fhort this melancholy part of our (lory, om
fhip being difahled, and three ofour men killed and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield: and were carried all
prifoners to Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors,
The ufage 1 had there was not fo dreadful as at firft I
apprehended; nor was 1 carried up the country, to the
emperor's court, as the reit of our men were, but wa§
kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper prize,
and made his Have, being young and nimble, and fit for
his bufinefs. At this iurprifmg change of my circuni-
fiances, from a merchant: to a miferable flave, I was
perfectly ov erwhelmed; and now 1 looked back upon my
father's prophetic difcourfe to me, that I mould be mife-
rable, and have none to relieve rue ; which I thought was
now fo effe&ual ly brought to pate, that I could not be
worfe; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me,
and I was undone without redemption. But alas! this
was but a tafte of the milery I was to go through, as will
appear in the fequel of this ftory.
As my new patron or mailer had taken me home to
hi'; houfe, fo I was in hopes, that he would take me with
him when he went to lea again, believing that it would
be iome time or other his fate to be taken by a Spanifli or
Portugal man or war, and that then 1 mould be let at li-
berty. But this hope of mine was icon taken away; for
when he went to fea, he left me on more to look after
his little garden, and do the drudgery of Haves about his
houfe; and when he came home again from his cruize,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after the (hip.
Here I meditated nothing but my efcape, and what
method I might take to effect it y but found no way that
had
 
had the kail probability in if; nothing preferred to make
the fuppofition of it rational; for 1 had nobody to com-
municate it to, that would embark with me, no fellow
Have, no Englishman, Irifhman, cr Scotfman there, but
myfelf; fo that for two years, though I often pleafecl my-
felf with the imagination, yet I never had the lea it en-
couraging profped of patting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumftance prefented
it It If, which put the old thoughts of making ionic at-
tempt for my liberty again in my head: my patron ly-
ing at home longer than ufuaL without fitting out his
fhip, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he ufed
conftantiy once or twice a week, fome times oftener, if the
weather was fair, to take the ifhip's pinnace, and go out
into the road a fifhing; and as he always took me and
a young Mareico with him to row the boat, we made him
\ cry merry, and I proved very dextrous in catching fifh;
infomuch, that fometimes he would fend me with a Moor,
one of his kinfmen, and the youth the Marefco, as they
called him, to catch a dim of fifh for him.
It happened one time, that going a fifhing with him Jo
a calm morning, a fog ro(e fo thick, that though we were
not half a league from the more, we loft fight of it;
and, rowing we knew not wither, or which way, we
laboured all day, and all the next night; and when the
morning came, we found we had pulled oft" to iea, in-
ftead of pulling in for the more; and that we were at
lea ft two leagues from the land: however, we got well'
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and fome
danger; for the wind began to blow pretty frefli in the
morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our pan on .warned by this difailer.reiolved to take
more care of himfelf for the future; and having lying by
him the long-boat of our Englifh (hip which he had taken,
he refolved he would not go a fifhing any more without a
com pits and fome pro virion; fo he ordered the carpenter
.of his fhip, who alfo was art Englifh Have, to build a lit-
tle ftate room or cabin in the middle of the long- boat,
like that of a barge, with a place to ft and behind it to
fteer. and haul home the main meet; and room before
for an hand or two to Hand and work the fails. She
failed witk what we call a fticulder of mutton tail; and
the
 
 
the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which jay
very mug and low, and had in it room for him to He, with
a Have or two, and a table to eat on, with fome fmall
lockers to put in fome bottles of inch liquor as he thought
fit to dunk; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a h*filing, and
as 1 was mo ft dextrous to catch Mm for him, he never
went without me. It happened one day, that he had
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleaiure or
for iilh, with two or three M >ors of fome diiiinction,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
therefore fent on board the boat over night a larger flora
of provilions than uiual 5 and had ordered me to get
ready three fufils with powder and mot, which were on
board his ihip; for that thzy defigned fome fport of
fowling as well as hihing.
I got all things ready as he had directed; and waited
the next morning with the boat wairied clean, her an-
cients and pendants out, and every thing to accommodate
his gueih; when by and bye my patron came on board
alone, and told me his gueiis had put off going, upon
fome bufmefs that fell out; and ordered me, with the
man and boy, as ufual, to go out with the boat, and
catch them fome fifh, for that his friends were to fup at
his houie; he commanded me too, that as foon as I had
got fome hlli, 1 mould bring it home to his houfe: all
which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts, for now I round I was like to have a
little Ihip at my command; and my mailer being gone,
I prepared to furnilh myfelf, not for riming bnfinefs, but
for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I fo much
as confider, whither I would fleer; for, any where to
get out of that place was my way.
My fiiil contrivance was to make a pretence to fpeak
to this Moor, to get fomething for our fubfiitence on
board j for I told him we mull not pre fume to eat of our
patron's bread; he laid, that was true ; fo he brought a
large bafket of rufk, or bifcuit of their kind, and three
jar3 with hem watei, into the boat; I knew where my
patron's cafe of bottles itood, which it was evident by the
make, were taken out of fome Englilh prize, and I con- veyedi
 
veyed them into the boat while the Moor was on fhore,
as if they had been there before, for our mafter : I con-
veyed alio a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed about half an hundred weight, with a parcel of
twine or thread, a hatchet, a faw, and a hammer,
all which were of great ufe to us afterwards; efpecially
the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon
him, which he innocently came into alfo: his name was
ll'mael, whom they call Muley,or Moloy; fo I called to
him, Moloy, faid I, our patron's guns are all on board
the boat, can you not get a little powder and fhot? it
may be we may kill fome aleamies (a fowl like our cur-
lews) for ourfelves; for 1 know he keeps the gunner's
ftores in the fhip. Yes, fays he, I'll bring fome; accord-
ingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held about
a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with fhot, that had five or fix pounds, with fome
bullets, and put all into the bo.it; at the fame time I
had found fome powder of my mailer's, in the great
cabin, with which 1 filled one of the large bottles in the
cafe, which was almoft empty; pouring what was in it
into another: and thus furnifhed with every thing need-
ful, we failed out of the port to fifh. The caitle, which
was at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and
took no notice of us, and we were not above a mile out
of the port, before we hauled in our fail, and fat us down
to fifh. The wind blew from the N. N. E. which was
contrary to my defire; for had it blown foutherly, I had
been fure to have made the coaft of Spain, and at leaf!
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my refolutions were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that
horrid place where 1 was, and leave the reft to fate.
After we had fiflied fome time, and catched nothing
(for when I had fifh on my hook, I would not pull them
up, that he might not fee them) I faid to the Moor,
This will not do, our mafter will not be thus ferved;
we muft ft and farther off: he, thinking no harm, agreed;
and being in the head of the boat, fet the fails; and as I
had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league farther,
and then brought her to, as if ] would nfh; when, giv-
ing the boy the helm, I ftept forward to where the Moor
was; and, making as if I ftooped for fomething behind
 
 
 
him, I took him by furprife with my arm under his twift,
and coded him clear over-board into the fea; he rofe
immediately, for he iwam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, to'd me he would go al!
over the world with me: hefwam fo urong after the
boat, that he would have readied me very quickly,* there
being but little wind; upon which I ilej ped into the
cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, i pre-
fented it at him, and told him, J had done him no hurt,
and, if he would be quiet, I would do him none; but,
fa id 1, you iwim well enough to reach the more, and the*
lea is calm, make the be ft of your way to the more, and
1 will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat, I
will (hoot you through the head; for 1 am refolved to
have my liberty. So he turned himfelf about, andfwam
for the more, and I make no doubt but he reached it with
cafe, for he was an excellent fwimmer.
1 could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no
venturing to troll him; when he was gone, i turned to
the boy, whom they called Xury, and had to him, Xury,
if you will be faithful to me, 1 will make you a great
man; but it you will not ilrokc your face to be true to
me, that is, ivvear by Mahomet, and his father's beard,
T mult throw you into the fea too. The boy fmlled in
my face, and fpoke fo innocently, that I could not mif-
truft him, and (wore to be faithful to me, and go al!
over the world with me.
While I was in the view of the Moor that was fwim-
ming, 1 ilood out diredly to fea, with the boat rather
llretching to windward, that they might think me gone
towards the Streight-mouth (as indeed any one that had
been in their wits mult have been fuppofed to do) for
who would have fuppofed we were failed on to the fouth-
ward, to the truly Barbarian court, where whole nations
of Negroes were fare to furround us with their canoes,
and deiiroy us; where we could never once goon more,
but we ihould be devoured by favage beafts, or more
merciieis lavages of human kind?
Bat a» ioon as it grew dufk in the evening, I changed
my courfe, and iteered directly fouth and by call, bend-
ing my courfe a 1 U it towards the eall, that I might
keep
 
KOBINSON CRUSOE. 25
keep In with the thore; and having a fair trefh gale of
wind, and a fmooth quiet lea, 1 made inch fail-, thar 1
believe by the rcxt day at three o'clock in tlit afternoon,
when I lull made Jre iand, I cui.id not be lets than i~}o
miles lb nth of Saiiee, quite beyond tlte emperor a Mo-
rocco's dominions, or indeed of any oilier kmg there-
abouts, lor we law no people.
Vci inch was 1 lie fright 1 had taken at the Moors, and
the dreadful appi thenfkms 1 had of falling into their
hands, that [would not Hop, or goon Jhore, or come
to an anchor, the wind eon aiming fair 5 till 1 had Jaii'd
in that manner five days; and then the wind fhifting
to the fouthward, i concluded alio, that if any of our
veftels were in chace of me, they alio would now give
over, fo 1 ventured to make to the coafl, and came to
an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not
what or where, neither what latitude, what country,
what nation, or what .river. 1 neither Caw, nor defired
to fee, any people; the principal thing 1 wanted was
ire Hi water. We came into tins creek in the evening,
relblving to fwim on fliore as foon as it was dark, and
ciifcovcr the country; but as foon as it was quite dark,
we heard fuch dreadful noiie.s of the barking, roaring,
and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, \hat the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to go on fliore till day* Well, Xury,
laid 1, then 1 won't; but it may be we may fee men by
day, who will be as bad to m as tkufe. lions ;.. Then we
may give them the moot gun, fays Xu.y, laughing, make
them ma away; fuch EcglMi Xury ipoke by couvcrfiug -
among us ilaves. 'However, 1 was glad to fee the boy
io cheerful, and I gave him a dram out oi our patron's
cafe of buttles, to ehear him up, After all, Xury's ad- 
vice was good, and I took k; we cropp'd our bale
anchor, and Jay Hill all night ; I fay Hill, for we fkpt
none; for in two or three hours we law vail great crea-
tures, we knew not what to call them, of many forts,
come-down to the fea fliore, and run into the water, wal-
lowing and wafbing themfelves, for the pleafure of cool-
ing tnemiclves; and they made f uch hideous bowlings
and yel!i?ig-s .that i never lacked beard the like;.,
Vol, i. . . . . . B . Xury-
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed Co was I
too: But we were both worfe frighted, when we heard
©ne mighty creature come fwimming towards our boat;
we could not fee him, but we might hear him by his
blowing, to be a monllrous, huge, and furious beaff;
Xury faid it was a Hon, and it might be for ought I
1 know, Poor Xury cried out to me to weigh the anchor,
and row away. No, fays 1, Xury, we can flip our
cable with a buoy to it, and go to Tea* they cannot fol-
low us far, J had no fooner faid fof but 1 perceived
the creature, whatever it was, within two oars length,
which fomething furprized me; however, 1 immediate-
ly Itept to the cabbin door, and taking up my gun, fired
at him; upon which he immediately turn'd about, and
lwam towards the more again.
Bat it was not poffible to defcribe the horrible noife,%
and hideous cries and howlings that were railed, as
well upon the edge of the more, as higher within the
country, upon the noife or report of a gun, a thing
I have fome reafon to believe thofe creatures had never
heard before, This convinced me, that there was no
going on more for us in the night, upon that coaft;
and how to venture on more in the day, was another
<jueftion too; for to have full en into the hands of any of
the lavages, had been as bad a* to have fallen into the
paws of lions and tigers; at leal we were equally ap-
prehensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on fliore
fomewhere or other for water, /or we had not a pint
left in the boat, when or where to get to it was the
point.—Xury faid, if 1 would let him go on fhore with
one of the jars, he would find, if the2 e was any water,
and bring tome to me. I diked him, why he would go;
why 1 mould not gcf and he ftay in the boat? The boy
anfwered with fo much affection, that made me love
him ever after—Says he, If wild mans come, they eat
me, you go way. Weil, Xury, faid I, we will both go,
mi if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they
fhall eat neither of us.—So I gave Xury a piece of ruflc-
bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's cafe of
bottles, which i mentioned before, and we haled the
boat in as near the fhore as we thought was proper.
 
 
nnd waded on fhore, carrying nothing but our arms, and
two jars for water.
1 did not care to go out of fight of the boat, fearing
the coming of the canoes with lavages down the river:
But the boy feeing a low place about a mile up the
country, rambled to it; and by and by i faw him come
running towards me: 1 thought he was purfued by fome
lavage, or frighted by fome wild be a It, and 1 ran
forward towards him, to help him; but when i came
nearer to him, I faw lometlung hanging over his moul-
ders, which was a creature that he had mot, like a hare,
but different in colour, and longer legs; however, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the
great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he
had found good water, and had feen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards, that we need not take fuch
pains for water, for a little higher up the creek where
we were, we found the water frefli when the tide was
out, which flows but a little way up; fo we filled our
jars, and feafted on the hare we had killed, and pre-
pared to go on our way, having leen no footileps of any
human creature in that part of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coaft before, I knew
very well, that the iilands of the Canaries, and the Cape
de Verd iilands a lib, lay not far off from the coaft; but
as I had no inflruments to t?ke an obfervation, to know
what latitude we were in. and did not exactly know, or at
lea it not remember what latitude they were in, 1 knew
not where to look for them, or when to Hand off to fea
towards them, otherwife I might now eafily have found
fome of thefe iilands. But my hope was, that if 1 Hood
along tlm coal! till I came to that part where the En-
gl im traded, 1 mould find iome of their veffels upon their
ufual deiign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the belt of my calculation, that place where I now
was, inn ft be that country which lying between the em-
peror of Morocco's dominions and the negroes, lies
waite and uninhabited, except by wild beats,; the ne-
groes having abandoned it, and gone further fouth, for
tear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth
inhabiting, by reafon of its barren nefs; and indeed both
forfaking it becaufe of the prodigious numbers of tigers,
i* 2 lions,
 
lions, leopards, and other furious creatures, which har-
bour there; fo that the Moors ufe it for their hunting
only, where they go like an army, two or three thoufand
men at a time; and indeed for near an hundred miles
together upon this coart, we faw nothing but a walte
uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but
howlings and roarings of wild bcafts by night.
Once or twice in the day time, I thought I faw the
Pico of TenerifFe, being the high top or the mountain
Tencrifve, in the Canaries; and had a great mind to
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the
fea alfo going too high for my little vcfiV!; fo 1 refolved
to purfue my firft defign, and kept aiong the ihore.
Several times we were obliged to livid for frefh wa-
ter, after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor un-
der a little point of land, which was pretty high; and
the tide beginning to flow, we lay Hill to go farther in.
Xury, whofe eyes were more about him than it feems
mine were, calls loftly to me, and tells me, that we had
beft go farther off the more; for, fays he, look yonder
lies a dreadful monfter, on the fide of that hillock, fafl
afleep. I looked where he pointed, and law a dreadful
monfter indeed, for it was a terrible great lion, that lay
on the fide of the more, under the {hade of a piece of
the hill, that hung as it were a little over him. Xury,
laid I, you mail go on ihore and kill him: Xury looked
frighted, and (aid, Me kill! he eat me atone mouth,
one mouthful he meant; however, I faid no mere to the
boy, but bade him be Hill, and took our biggelt gun,
which was almoft muiket bore, an J loaded it with a
good charge of powder, and with tuo lings, and laid
it down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets,
and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with
five fmaller bullets. I took the belt aim I could with the
firft piece, to have mot him in the head; but he lay fo,
with his leg railed a little above his nofc, that the Aug
hit his leg, about the knee, and broke the bone. He
darted up, growling at firft; but finding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then got up upon tnree legs, and
gave the moil hideous roar that I ever heard, 1 was a
little
 
 
little furpriied that I had not hit him on the head; how-
ever, I took up the fecond piece immediately, and ih'f
he began to move off, fired again, and (hot him into the
head, and had the plea.'n re to fee him drop, and making
but little ooife, he lay itruggiiug for life. Then Xury
took heart, and would hrv. me let hirn go on fhote:
Well, go, faid 1; f> the hoy jamp*d into the water, and
taking the iittie gun in one hand, fvain to the Ihorc
with the othtr hand; and coining dole to the creature,
put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, arid ihot him into
the head again, which difpatdi'd him quite.
This was g.;mc indeed to us, but this was no food;
and J was very f >rry to lofe three charges of powder and
ihot, upon a creatine that was good for nothing to us.-—
If u\ ever, \ :ny faid he would have fume of Fn; fo he
conies on hoard, and a iked me to give him u*c hatchet.
For what, Xary, laid I, We cut off his head, laid he.—-
However, Xary could not cut oil*his head, but he cut off
a loot, and brought it with him, and it was a moaftroua
great one.
I bethought tnyfelC however, the, • perhaps the fktfi of
him might one way or other be ol' lome value to us;
aiid I reiolved to take of his {kin, if I could. So Xury
.\n i I weal to work with him; but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us up, both, the whole day; but at htl
we got off the hide of him, and fpreadingit on the top
cfojr cabin, the lun effectually dried it in two days
time, and it afterwaids ferved me to lie upon
A:ter this ftop we made on to the foutfnvard continu-
ally fir ten or twelve days, living very fparingly on our
provifions, which began to abate very much, and going
no oftener into the more than we were obliged "to, for
frelh water. My ucfign in this was to make the river
Gambia or Senegal, that is to fay, any where about the
Cape de Verd, where i was in hopes to meet with fome
European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
courfe I ha j to take, but to feek for the Iflands, or pe.
rifti there among the negroes. I knew that all the (hips
from Europe, which faii'd either to the toad of Guinea,
or to Bra hi, or to the Eaft-Indies, made this cape, or
thofe ill audi | a id, in a word, I put the whole of my
B 3 fortune
 
fortune upon this fingle point, either that I muft meet
with fome fhip, or mull perith.
When I had purfued this refolution about ten days
longer, as I find, I began to fee that the land was in-
habited; and in two or three places, as we failed by,
we faw people fland upon the more to look at us; we
could alfo perceive they were quite black, and flark na-
ked. I was once inclined to have gone on more to them;
but Xury was my better counsellor, and faid to me, No
go, no go. However, I haled in nearer the fhore, that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along the more
by me a good way. I obferved they had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who had a long (lender flick,
which Xury faid was a lance, and that they could throw
them a j*eat way with good aim; fo I kept at a dif-
tance, but talked with them by figns as well as I could,
and particularly made figns for fomethitig to eat. They
beckoned to me to Mop my boat, and they would fetch
me fome meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my fail,
and lay by; and two of them ran up into the countryr
and in lefs than h r*f an hour came back, and brought
with them two pieces of dried flefii, and fome corn, fuch
as is the produce of their country.; but we neither knew
what the one or the other was; however, we were will-
ing to accept it. Bat^how to come at it was our next
difpute, for 1 was not for venturing on fhore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a fafe way
for us all; for they brought it to the fhore, and laid it
down, and went and flood a great way off, till we fetch-
ed it on board, and then came clofe to us again.
We made figns of thanks to them, for we had no-
thing to make them amends; but an opportunity offer-
ed that very inflant to oblige them wonderfully; for
while we were lying by the more, came two mighty
creatures, one purfuing the other, as we took it, with
great fury, from die mountains towards the fea; whe-
ther it was the male purfuing the female, or whether
they were in fport, or in rage, we could not tell, any
more than we could tell whether it was ufual or ftrange,
but I believe it was the latter, becaufe, in the firfl place,
thofe ravenous creatures feldom appear but in the
night; and, in the fecond place, we found the people
terribly
 
terribly affrighted, efpecially the women. The man that
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the
reft did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into
the water, they did not feem to offer to fall upon the ne-
groes, but plunged themfelves into the fea, and fwam
about as if they had come for their diverfion; at laft one
of them began to come nearer our boat than J firlt ex-
peaed; hut I lay ready for him; for J had loaded my
gun with all poffible expedition, and bid Xury load both
the others. As foon as he came fairly within my reach, I
lired, and ihot him direftly into the head: immediately
lie funk down into the water, but rofe inflantly, and plung-
ed up and down as if ilrugglmg for life; and fo indeed he
was; he immediately made to the more; but between
the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the flrang-
ling of the water, he died juil before he reached fhors.
Jt is impoffible to exprefs the aftonifliment of theie
poor creatures at the noiie and fire of my gun; lomc of
them were ready even to die with fear, and fell down
as dead with the very terror. But wluu they faw the
creature dead, and funk into the water, and that T made
fsgns t) them to coons to the ihorc, they took heart,
and came to the fhors, tnA beg?/! t*y f<ir rhe crea-
ture. I faun 1 him by his blood Itaining the water, and
by the help of a rope, which I flung round him, and
gave the negroes to hale, they dragged him on more,
and found th:u it was a mod curious leopard, fpotted
and fine so an admirable degree; and the negroes held
np their haiis with a J miration, to thii k what it was I
killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flam of fire,
and the noife of the gnu, fwam to the Hi ore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from which they came,
nor could I, at that alliance, know what it was. I found
quickly the negroes were for eating the flern of this
creature; fo I was willing to have them take it as a
favor from me, which, when I made figns to them,
that they might take it, they were very thankful for.
Immediately they fell to work with him; and tho' they
had no knife, yet, with a fharpened piece of wood, they
took off his fkin as readily, nay much more readily than
we would have done with a knife; they offered me fome
B 4 of
 
 
of the fief}), wnich I declined., making as if I would
give it them; but made figns for the fkin, which they
g.'.ve me very freely, and brought me a great deal more
of their provifion, which, tho' 1 did not undcMand, yet
1 accepted. Then I made figns to them fur fome wa
tor, and held out one of my jars to them, turning its
bottom upward, to (hew that it was empty, and that I
wanted to have it fi.kd. They ca led immediately to
iome of their fiends, and there came two women, and
brought a great veilVd made of earth, and burnt, as Ifup-
pt*U:, in the Urn; this they let down for me, as before,
and I lent Xury on Ihore with toy jars, and filled them
ad turee. Tne women were as ilark naked as the men*
1 was now furniftied with rcct? and corn, fuch as it
was, and water; and leaving my friendly negroes, 1
made forward lor about eleven days more, without of-
fering to go near the more, till I law the land run out
a great length into the ica, at about the difiance of four
v.v in e leagues before me; end the fea being very calm,
I kept a large oiling to make this point; at length,
doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land,
I faw plainly land on the ot';e fide, to fea-wards; then
x cuuciuueu, m it WH«r molt crn«*Mi InCT"CCl, tMat tilf5 IVUs
the Cape de Verd, and thofe the iHands called from
thence, Cape de Verd iflands. However, ilicy were at
a great difiance, and I could not well tell what I had belt
to do; for if I mould be taken with a freili gale of wind,
1 might neither r.-xch one nor the other,
In this dilemma, as f was very pen five, I ilept into
the cabin, and let me d.nvn, Xury having the reim;
when cn a fudden the boy cried out, Mailer, matter, a
fhip was a fail: and the foohfn boy was frighted out ot
his wits, thinking it muft nerd > be fome of his mailer's
mips feat to purfue us, when I knew we were gotten far
enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin,
and immediately faw, not only the fhip, but what iliewa - ,
viz. that it was a Porta gee fe fhip, and as I thought, was
bound to the coaft of Guinea for negroes. But when I ob-
served the courfe fne fleered, I was loon convinced they
were bound fome other way, and did not defign to go
any nearer the more; upon which 1 ftrctched out tofea as
much as I could, refolving to fpeak with them if poffible.
 
With all the fail I could make, I found 1 fhould not
be able to come in their way, but that they would be
gone by before I could make any iignai to them; but
after I 'hadcrouded to the utmofl, and began to defpair,
they, it feems, faw me by the help of their perfpeclive-
glaffes, and that it was fome European boat, which they
Juppofed iniiil belong to fome fhip that was loll; fo they
fhortened fail to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my patron's eniign on board, i made
a waft of it to them, for a fignai of dilbeis, and fired a
gun, both of which they faw; for they told me they faw
the fmoke, tho' they did not hear the gun; upon thefe
fignals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me,
and in about three hours time I came up with them,
They afked me what I was , in Portuguefe, in Spanilh,
and in French, but F under Hood none of them; but at
Jail a Scots failor, who was on board, called to me, and
I anfwered him, and told him F was an Englifhman, that
had made my efcape out of flavery from the Moors, at
Sal lee ; then they bid rne come on board, and very kind-
ly took nK' in and all my goods.
It was an inexpreffihle joy to me, any one will be-
lieve, that I was thus delivered, as I eiteemed it, from
fuch a miferable and almofl hopelefs condition as I was
in; I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the
ihip, as a return ibr my deliverance; but he generoufly
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I
had mould be delivered laic to me when I came to the
Braftb; For, fays he, I have laved your life on no other
terms, than as I would be glad to be faved myfelf, and
it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the
fame condition; be fides, when I carry you to the Brafiis, fo
great away from your own country, if J fhould take from
you what little you have, you will be ftarved there, and
then I only take away that life I have given* No, no,
Signior Inglefe (Mr. Englifhman) I would carry you thi-
ther in charity; and thefe things will help you to buy
your fubfiftence there, and your paflage home again.
As he was charitable in this gropofal, fo he was juftin
the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the fearnen,
that none fhould offer to touch any thing I had; nhen he
took every thing into his own poiTeffioa, and gave me
£ 5 back
 
 
back an exafl inventory of them, that I might have
them again, even lb much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat it was a very good one, and that he
favv, and told me he would buy it of me for the fhip'3
life, and afked me what 1 would have tor it. I told him
he had been ib generous to'me in every thing, that I
could not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it
entirely to him; upon which he told me he would give
me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it
at Brafil; and when it came there, if any one offered to
give more, he would make it up. He offered me alfo 60
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath
to take ; not that I was unwilling to let the captain have
him, but I was very loath to fell the poor boy's liberty,
who had aflifted me fo faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reafon, he own'd it
to be juft, and offered me this medium, that he would
give the boy an obligation to fet him free in ten years,
if he turned ChriiHan. Upon this, and Xury faying he
was willing to go to him, 1 let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brafils, and arrived
in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in
about 22 days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the molt miferable of all condition of life; and
what to do next with myfelf I was to confider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never fufficiently remember; he would take nothing of
me for my paffage, gave me 20 ducats for the leopard's
/kin, and 40 for the lion's fkin, which I had in the boat;
and caufed every thing I had in the fhip to be punctual-
ly delivered me; and what I was willing to fell he
bought; fuch as the cafe of bottles, two of my guns, and
a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had made candles
of the reft; in a word, I made about 230 pieces of
tight of all my cargo, and with this ftock I went on
Ihore in the Brafils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended to
the houle of a good honeft man like himfelf, who had an
ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation, and a fu-
gar-houie, I lived with him fome time; and acquainted
myfelf, by that means, with the manner of their plant-
ing and making fugar; and feeing how well the plant-
er:
 
ers lived, and how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolved,
if I could get a licence to fettle there, i would turn
planter among them; refolving, in the mean time, to
find out fome way to get my money which i had left: in
London, remitted to me. To this purpotc, getting a kind
of a letter of naturalization, 1 purchafed as much land
that was uncured, as my money would reach; and formed
a plan for my plantation and fettlement, and fuch an one
as might be fuitable to the {lock which I propofed to
myfeif to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguefe of Lifbon, but born
of Engliih parents, whofe name was Wells, and in much
fuch circumllances as 1 was. I call him neighbour, be-
caufe his platation lay next to mine; and we went on
very fociably together; my ftock was but low, as well
as his; and we rather planted for food than any thing
elie, for about two years. However we began toincreafe,
and our land began to come into order ; fo that the
third year we planted fome tobacco, and made each of
us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in
the year to come; but we both wanted help; and now
I found more than b31 ore, I had done wrong in parting
with my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right,
Was no great wonder; I had no remedy but to go on;
I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
genius, and direcUy contrary to the life I delighted in,
and for which I forfook my father's.houfe, and broke
thro* all his good advice: Nay, 1 was coming into the
very middle ltation, or upper degree of low life, which
my father advifed me to before, and which if I refolved
to go on with, I might as well have ftaid at home, and
never fatigued myfeif in the world, as I have done; and
I ufed ^ often to fay to myfeif, I could have done this
as well in England among my friends, as have gone 5000
miles off, to do it among llrangers and favages in a wil-
dernefs, and at fuch a diftance as never to hear from any
part of the world, that had the lead knowledge of me.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my condition
with the utrnoft regret. I had nobody to convcrfe with
but now and; »then this neighbour; no work to be done
but by the labour of my hands; and I ufed to fav, I li ved
16 'joft
 
juil like a mm call away upon force defolatc iflan J, that
had nobody there but himielf: But how juil has it been,
and how fhould all men reflect, that when they compare
their prefent condition with others that are worie, hea-
ven may oblige them to make the exchange,and be con-
vinced of their former felicity, by their experience! J
faw how juil it has been, that the truly lolitary Hie I re-
flected on in an ifland, or mere deiolation, mould be
my !o% who had fo often unjultly compared it with the
lite wiucii I then led, in which, had 1 continued, I had,
in all probability, been exceeding proiperous and rich I
1 was in lb me degree let tied in my meafures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend the cap-
tain of the ihip that took me up at lea, went back; for
the (hip remained there in providing her loading, and
preparing for her voyage, near three months; when
telling him what little ftock I had left behind me in
London, he gave me this friendly and fincere advice:
Siguior Ingleic, fays he (for fo he always called me) if
you will give me letters, and a procuration here, in form
to me, with orders to the perfon who has your money in
London, to fend your effects to Lilbon, to fuch perfons
as I lhali direct, and in fuch goods as are proper for this
country I will bring you the produce of them, God will-
ing, at my return; but fince human affairs are all fub-
jeft to changes and di fa Iters, I would have you give orders
but for tool, fteriing, which you fay is half your Hook,
and let the hazard be run for the fu ft; fo that if it
comes fafe, you may order the reft the fame way; and
if it mifcarries, you imy have the other half to have re-
coil rfe to for your fupp'y.
This was fuch whole tome advice, and look'd fo friend-
ly, that I could not but be convinced it was the bell
courfe I could take; fo I accordingly prepared letters to
the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and a
procuration to the Portuguefe captain, as he defired.
I wrote the Eilh captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my ftavery, ell ape, and how 1
had met with the Portugal captain at lea, the humanity
of his behaviour, and what condition I was now in,
with all other nee ftary directions for my fupply;
and when this honeft captain came to Lifbon, he found
means
 
 
means, by fome of the Englifh merchants there, to fend
over not the order only, but a full recount cf my iiory
to a merchant at London, who prefect: a it effectually to
her; whereupon, ihe not only delivered toe money, but
out of her own pocket fent the Portugal captain a very
handfome preient lor his humanity and charity to me*
The merchant in London veiled this 100I. in Kngiiih
goods, inch as the captain had written lor; fent ihrm
directly to him at Lifbon, and he brought them all iafe to
me to the Biafils; among which, without my direction
(for I was too young in my bufincfs to think oi them)
he had taken care to have all ions of tools, iron-work,
and utenfils necelLry for my plantation, and which were
of great uie to me.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made,
for I was furprized with the joy oi it; and my good ftew-
ard, the captain, had laid o ;t the 5L which my friend
had fent him for a pre lent • - r himfelf, to purchafe, and
bring me over a fervant unu^r bond for fix years fer-
vice; and would not accept nt ^ay confideration, except
a little tobacco, which 1 wc uld Lave him accept, being
of m^own produce.
Neither wa-;, this al, but my goods being all Englifh
manufacture?. fuch as cloth, ftutT, bays, and thing? par-
ticularly valuable and deferable in the country, 1 found
means to fell them to a vcrv grest advantage % fo that I
may fay, 1 had more than lour times the value of my firft
cargo, and was now in finitely beyond my poor neigh-
bour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for
the foil thing 1 fid, 1 bought me a N :gio (lave, and art
European fervant a lib; I mean another be fides that which
the captain brought me fr-;m Lifbon.
But as abufed proipenty is oftentimes made the very
means of our greatest vc. fity, lb was it with me. I
went on the next year with tyreat iuccrn In my planta-
tion; \ raifed 50 great roils of tob <,.i my own
ground, more than 1 had difpoied v f or ntceflaries
among my neighbours; and thefe 50 rcHs being each
oi above loolb. weight, were well cur :, and laid by,
a. a :i:l the return of the fleet from Li- u And now
incieafmg in bufmefs and wealth, my :• -jegan to be
full cf projects and undertakings be}, .a my reach;
fuch
 
*
fuch as are indeed often the ruin of the bell heads in
bufincfs.
Had I continued in the ftation I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me,
for which my father fo carneftly recommended a quiet
retired life, and which he had fo fenfibly defcribed the
middle nation of life to be full of; but other things
attended me, and I was ftill to be the wilful agent of all
my own mil tries: and particularly to increafe my faults,
and double the reflections upon myfelf, which in my fu-
ture furrows 1 mould have leifure to make; all thefe
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obftinate
adhering to my foolilh inclination of wandering abroad;
and purfuing that inclination, in contradiction to the
clearer! views of doing myfelf good in a fair and plain
purfuit of thofe profpects, and thofe meafures of life*
which nature and providence concurred to prefent me
with, and to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my
parents, fo 1 could not be content now, but I mult go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to purfue a
rafh and immoderate deiire of rifing falter than the na-
ture of the thing admitted; and thus I caft myfelf down
again into the decpeil gulph of human mifery that ever
man fell into, or perhaps could be confident with life,
and a ltate of health in the world.
To come then by juil degrees to the particulars of
this part of my ftory; you may fuppofe, that having
now lived almolt four years in the Brafiis, and beginning
to thrive and profper very well upon my plantation, I
had not only learned the language, but had contracted
acquaintance and friendfhip among my fellow planters
as well as among the merchants at St. Saivadore, which
was our port'; and that, in my difcourfe among them,
I had frequently given them an account of my two voy-
ages to the coaft of Guinea, the manner of trading with
the Negroes there, and how eafy it was to purchafe upon
the coait, for trifles (fuch as beads, to^s, knives, fcifTarp,
hatchets, bits of giafs, and the like) not only gold duft»
Guinea grains, elephants teeth. &c. but Negroes for the
Service of the Bralils, in great numbers.
They
 
They lillened always very attentively to my difcourfes
on thefe heads, but efpecially to that part which related
to the buying Negroes, which was a trade at that time not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carried on by the Affientos, or permiflion of the king of
Spain and Portugal, and engroiled in the public Hock;
fo that few Negroes were bought, and thofe exceflive dear*
It happened, being in company one day with fome
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of thofe things very earneflly, three of them came to me
the next morning, and told me, they had been muling
very much upon what I had difcourfed of with them the
laft night, and they came to make a fecret propofal to
me; and, after enjoining me fecrecy, they told me that
they had a mind to fit out a fhip to go to Guinea; that
they had all plantations as well as I, and were ftreight-
ened for nothing fo much as fervants; that as it was a
trade that could not publicly fell the Negroes when they
came home, fo they defired to make but one voyage,
to bring the Negroes on more privately , and divide them ,
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the quef-
tion was, whether I would go their fupercargo in the
fhip, to manage the trading part upon the coaft of Gui-
nea? And they offered me, that I mould have my equal
mare of the Negroes, without providing any part of the
lock.
This was a fair propofal, it muft be confeffed, had it
been made to any one that had not had a fettlement and
plantation of his own to look after, which was in a fair
way of coming to be very confuierable, and with a good
Hock upon it. But for me, that was thus eftablifhed,
and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three
or four years more, and to have fent for the other 100L
from Fngland, and who in that time, and with that little
addition, could fcarce have failed of being worth 3 or
4000U fterling, and that increafmg too; for me to think
of fuch a voyage, was the moil prepoflerous thing that
ever man, in fuch circumftances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own deftroyer, could
no more refill the offer, than I could reflrain my frrft
rambling defigns, when my father's good counfel was
loft
 
loft upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with
ai my heart, if they would undertake to look after my
plantation in my abfence, and would difpoie of it to
fuch a:. I (b aald direct, if 1 mifearried. This they all
engaged to do, and entered inio writings, or covenants,
to do to; and I made a formal will, dilpoiing of my
plantation and effects, in cafe of my death, making the
captain of the (hip that had faved my life, as before,
my univenal heir, but obliging him to difpoie of my ef-
fects as 1 had directed in my will ; one h df of the produce
being to himfeif, and the other to be lhipred to England.
In ihorr, I took all poflible caution to prelerve my
effects, and to keep up my plantation. Had I ufed half
as much prudence to have looked into my own intereft,
and have made a judgment of what 1 ought to have
done, and not to have done, J had certainly never gone
away from fo prosperous an undertaking; leaving all the
probable views of a thriving circumitance, and gone up-
on a voyage to fea, attended with all its common ha-
zards; to fay nothing of the rcafons J had to expect
particular misfortunes to myfelf.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates
of my fancy, rather than my reafon: and accord-
ingly the thip bei"g fitted out, and the cargo finifhed,
and all thingr. done as by agreement, by my partners in
the voyage; 1 went on board in an evil hour again, the
ill of September, 16^9, being the fame day eight years
thai i went fiv.n my father and mother at Hull, in order
to adt the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own inter 11.
Our {hip was about i 20 Tons burthen, carried fix
guns and fourteen men, beiK.es the matter, his boy,
and myfelf: We had on bi ai d no la ge cargo of goods,
except fuch toys as wee fit tut our trade with the
Negroes; iuc.'i as bead;., bits or gia/s, ihcils, and odd
trifles; efpecially little looking-glaffes, knives, Icif-
fars, hatchets, and the ii!;c.
The fame day I went on board, we fet fail, {landing
away to the northward upon our own coatts, with
defign to IIretch over for the African coaft, when they
came in about 10 or 12 degrees of northern lati-
tude j which, it feems, was the maimer of their courfe
in
 
in thofe days: we ha 1 very good weather, only excel -
fire hot, ail the way upon our own coail, till we came
tot lie height of Cape St. Auguilino; irom whence keep*
ino; i art her elf at fea, we ieii fight of land, and fleered as
ii we were bound for the i lie Fern and de Noroiiba, hold-
ing our comic N. K. by N. and leaving thofe ifies on
the EalL Jn this comic we pa fled the line in about iz
days time, and were by our lait observation in 7 de-
crees 22 inin. hoithern latitude, when a violent tor-
1 ado or hunicane took us quite out cf our knowledge;
it began from the louth-eaib, came about to the north-
w.fl, and then fettled in the north-call, from whence
it flew in fuch a terrible manner, that for 12 days to-
gether, we could do nothing but drive; and fcudding
aua) be lore it, k t it carry us wherever fate and the
Jury of the winds directed; and during theie 12 cays I
need not Ly t that I expected everyday to be fvvailov. ed
up, nor did any in the Ihip expect to lave their lives.
In this di finds uc v.:.A, hc:'kc;-, the terror of a Ileum,
one of our men died of the calenture, and a man and a
hoy wafted over-b- ai d. About the 1 2th day, the wea-
ther abating 4 iudo; the r*;a.iter CvIL c.-jci Vvincn 23
veil as he -tould, ana found that he was in about 11 de-
grees of north latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of
longitude difference welt f om Cape St. Auguftino, fo
tnat he lound he was gotten upon the coaft of Guiana,
or the north part of Brail:, beyond the river Amazones,
towards that of the river Orooncque, commonly called
the Great River; and r.ow lie began to coniult with me
what cowrie, he fhould take; for the fhip was leaky, and
\ cry fr.ach dii&bicd; aud he was for going direct y back
to the coail of lira hi.
1 was rofiti\tly apandl that, and, looking over the
chart;, ol v>c Sea coall of America with hira, we concluded
there was no inhabited country for us to have recourfe
to, tilt we came within the circle of the Caribbe I (lands;
a;ul therefore lelblved to Hand away fur Barhaboes,winch
by keeping off at fea, to avoio the indraught of the
bay or gulph of Mexico, we m ight eafily perform, as we
hoped, in about fifteen days laid; whereas we could
not poilibjy mainour voyage to the coait of Africa,,
without fome aflifiance both to our fbip and to our i elves.
With,'
 
With this design we changed our courfe, and (leered
away N.W. by YV. in order to reach fome of our En-
giifh iHands, where 1 hoped for relief; but our voyage
was otherwise dcienrmiv d; for, being in the latitude of
12 deg. 18 min. a iecond florin came upon us, which
carried m away with the fame impetuofity weilward,
and drove us fo out of the very way of all human com-
merce, that had all our lives been faved, as to the Tea,
we were rather in danger of being devoured by fav.;ge«,
than ever returning to our own country.
In this diilrefs, the wind ftill blowing very hard, one
of our men, early one morning cried out land; and
we had no fooner run out of the cabin to look: out, in
hopes of feeing whereabouts in the world we were, but
the (hipftruck upon a fand, and in a moment, her mo-
tion biting fo Hopped, the fea broke over her in fuch a
manner that we expected we mould all have pe rimed im •
mediately; and we were even driven into our clofe quar-
ters, to fhelter m from the very foam and fpray of the :ea.
It is not eafy for any one, who has not been in the
like condition, to deferibe or conceive the coaft rna ion
of men in fuch circu alliances; we knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land it was we w*re driven,
whether an ifland or the main, whether inhabited or
not inhabited; and, as the rage of the wind was ftill
great, though rather lefs than at firfl, we cou'd not fo
much as hope to have the fhip hold many minutes with-
out breaking in pieces, unlets the winds, by a kind of
miracle, mould turn immediately about. In a word,
we fat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting acco/dingly, as
preparing for another worjd; for there was little or
nothing more for us to do in this: that which was
our prefent comfort, and all the comfort we had, was,
that, contrary to our expectation, the llvip did not
break yet, and that the matter (aid the wind began to
abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the fliip having thus (truck upon the fand,
and Hi eking too fait for us to expect her getting off,
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had no-
thing to do but to think of faving our lives as well as
we:
 
we could. We had a boat at our ilern, juft before the
iturm; but me was firil flaved by darning againffc the
Ihip's rudder, and in the next place fhe broke away,
and either funk, or was driven off to lea. fo there was
no hope from her: We had auother boat on board, but
how to get her off into the fea was a doubtful thing;
however, there was no room to debate; for we fancied
the ihip would break in pieces every minute ; and fome
told us fhe was actually broken already.
in this diftrefs the mate of our veiled lays hold of the
boat, and with the help of the reft of the men, they got
her Hung over the (hip's fide, and getting ali into her,
let go, and committed ourfelves, being eleven in num-
ber, to God's mvTcy and the wild fea; for though the
Hoi m was abated confiderably, yet the fea went dread-
fully high upon the more, and might well be called Den
wild Zee, as the Dutch call the iea in a llorm.
And now our cafe was very difoal indeed; for we all
law plainly, that the fea went fo high, that the boat
could nctefcape, and that we mould be inevitably drown-
ed. As to making fail, we had none, nor, if we had*
could we have done any thing with it; fo we worked at
the car towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like
men goii«g to execution; for we all knew, that when
the boat came near the more, Ihe would be dallied in a
thoufand pieces by the breacji of the fea* However,
we committed our fouls to God in the moil earner! man-
ner, and the wind driving us towards the fhore, we
haftened our dcftmclion with our own hands, pulling, as
well as we could, to,vard. laud.
What the more was, whether rock or fand, whether
fleep or fhoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the leall fhadow of expectation, was,
if we might happen into fome Bay or Gulph, or the
mouth of fome river, where by great chance we might
have run our boats in, or got under the lee of the land;
and perhaps made fniooth water. But there was nothing?
of this appeared; but us we made nearer and nearer
the ihore, the land looked more frightful than the
fea...
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, moun-
tain*-
 
tain-like, came roiling aitem of us, and plainly old m
expect the Coup tie Grace. In a word, it took us with
fu/h a fury, that it oveivet the boat at once, and fepa-
rating us a-i wed from the b».-at as from one another,
gave us net tinu5 haidly to lav, O God! for we were all
i wallowed up in a moment
Nothing can deicribc the confufton of thought which
I hit whsn 1 funk into the water; for tho' 1 iwarn very
well, yt t I could not deii-.er myfe'i'" from the waves io
as to draw breach, till that wave having driven me, or
rather carried me a vaii: way cm towards the Ihore, and
having Ipent itleif, went back, and icf; me upon the
land almost dry, but half dead with the water 1 took
in: I had fo much prcfence of mind, as wed as breath
left, that feeing mylclr nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got vpo:i my feet, and endeavouring to make
on towards the land, as fait as 1 could, be,ore anodiei
wave thould return, and take me up n^-aiii. b\ i I ioon
found Jt was impofiude to avoid it, for 1 law the fea
come after me as high as a gieat hill, arid as furious as
an enemy, which I n ;d no means or ilrevigth t ) contend
with; my bufi ;er* Wr- «> hold my breath, and unfe my-
felf upon the waier, if I couL, and fo by Iwimmi;^ to
preferve my bre.vhiug, and pilot -myfelf ^.vardj the
more, if poinble; ray gre< t-It concern nnw being, that
the wave, as it would carry u.c a great w?y towards the
more when it came on, might not carry me back again
with if, when it gave back towards the lea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at
once 20 or 30 feet deep in its own bod), and 1 could
f eel my fell carried with a migby jnrce an d fwithicfs
towards the Ihore, a very great way; but 1 held my
breath, end aflifted myielf to fwim Hill forward with
rJ] my might, J was ready to burft with holding my
breath, when, as I found myfelf rifmg up, fo, 10 my
immediate relief, I found my head and ha^ds moot
out above the lurface of the water; and though it was
not two feconds of time that I could keep myielf fo,
yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new
courage. I was covered again with water a good
while, but not io long but I held it out j and finding the
water had fpent itfelf, and began to return, I ftruck
forward
 
 
 
 
 
forward againit the return of tie waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. 1 i>ocd Hill a few moments
to recover breath, and til! the waters went from mo, and
then 1 took to my heels, and ran with what itrength I
had, farther towards the flu,-re. But neither would this
deliver me from the hi; y of the fea, which came pour-
ing after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by
the waves, and carried forwards as before, the more be-
ing very flat,
The laII time of thefe two had well near been fatal
to me; for the lea, having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dallied me, again if a piece of a
rock, and that with fuch f ree, as it left me fenPelefs,
and indeed heipleis, as to mine own deliverances; for the
blew, taking my fide and bread, beat the bre-ith as
it were quite out of my body; and had it returned again
immediately, I mult have been ilrangled in the water;
but 1 recovered a little before ;he return of the waves;
and feeing i. mould be covered again with the water, I
relolved to hold fail by a piece of the rock, and fo to
hold my breath, if po fable, till the wave went back.
Now as the waves were not io high as at hilt, being
near land, 1 kept my hold riil inc waves abated; and
then fetched another run, which brought me fo near the
more, that the next wave, tho' it went over me, yet
did not fo Aval low rue up, as to carry mcawa/; and the
next run I took. I got to the main kind, where, to my ,
great comfort, I c amb< red up the ciiitsof the more, and
fat me down upon the grafs, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and fafe on fnore, and began to
look up and thank God, that my life was faved in a
cafe wherein th.re was, fome minutes before, (carce any
room to hope. I believe it is impofliblc to expreis to
the life, what the extafics and traufports of the foul
are when it is fo laved, as I may fay, out of the very ,
jjave; and I do not wonder no.v at *•hat cuilom, viz.
1 lua when a malefactor, who has the aalter about his
neck, is tied up, and jult going to be turned off, and
has a reprieve brought to him; I fay, i do not won-
der, that they bring a iurgeon with it, to let him blood
that very moment they tell him of it, that the furprife
may
 
may not drive the animal fpirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him.
For fudden joys, like griefs, confound at fir ft.
I walked about on the more, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thoufand
geftures and motions, which I cannot defcribe, reflecting
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there
mould not be one foul faved but myfelf; for as for them,
I never faw them afterwards, or any fign of them, ex-
cept three of their hats, one cap, and two flioes, that
were not fellows.
I caft my eyes to the ilranded veffel, when the breach
and froth of the fca being fo big, I could hardly fee it,
it lay fo far off; and confiJered, Lord! how was it pofli-
ble I could get on more.
After I had folaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to fee
what kind of place I was in, and what was the next to
be done; and I foon found my comforts abate, and that,
in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet,
had no cloaths to mi ft me, nor any thing either to eat
or drink, to ccmrort me; neither did I fee any profpecT:
before me but that of perilling with hunger, or being
devoured by wild beafts: And that which was particu-
larly am idling to me was, that 1 had no weapon either to
hunt or kill any creature f r my fuller ance, or to defend
myfelf againft any otiier creature that might defire to kill
me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a
knife, a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box ; this
was all my pro vi lion, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a
madman. Night coming upon me, I began with an
heavy heart, to con fide r what would be my lot, if there
were any ravenous bcalls in that country, feeing at night
they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time was, to "get up into a thick bufliy tree like a fir,
but thorny, which grew near me, and where I refolved
to fit all night, and con fider the next day what death
 
I mould die; for, as yet, I faw no prof peel: of life. I
walked about a furlong from the fhore, to fee if I could
find any frefh water to drink, which I did to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my
mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to the tree; and,
getting up into it, endeavoured to place myfelf fo, as
that, if 1 Ihould fleep, I might not fall; and, having
cut me a fhort flick like a truncheon, for my defence, I
took up my lodging; and having been exce{lively fa-
tigued, 1 tell fall alieep, and flept as comfortably as I
believe few could have done in my condition; and
found myfelf the moft refrcfhed with it, that 1 think I
ever was on fuch an occafion.
When 1 a vaked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the ilorm abated, lb that the iea did not rage and
fv/ell as before: But that which furpriieJ me moft was,
that the Ihip was lilted off, in the night, from the fand
where fne lay, by the fwc lling of the tide, and was
driven up a 1 mo ft as far as the rock, which I fir ft men-
tioned, where 1 had been fo bruifed by the dafhing me
againil it; this being within about a mile from the more
where 1 way, and the ihip feeming to ftand up ftill, I
wifhed myfelf on board, that at leall, I might lave fome
neceflary things for my u(e.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked about me again; and the firft thing 1 found was
the boat, which lay as the wind and the lea had toffed
her upon the land, about two miles to my right hand.
I walked as far as J could upon the fhore, to have got to
her; but found a neck or inlet of water between me
and the boat, which was about half a mile broad; fo I
came back, for the prelcnt, being more intent upon get-
ting at tne Ihip, where 1 hoped to find fomething for my
prefent fubfiftence.
A little after noon I found the fea very calm, and
the tide ebbed fo far our, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the fhip: And here 1 found a frefh
renewing of my grief; for I faw evidently, that if we
had kept on board, we had been all fafe; that is to fay,
we had all got fafe on fhore, and I had not been fo mi-
serable as to be left entirely deftitute of all comfort and
company, as I now was; This forced tears from my
-. eyes
 
eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I re
folved, if poffible, to get to the (hip; fo J pulled off my
cloaths (for the weather was hot to an extreme) and took
to the water; but when I came to the ihip, my difiiculty
was itill greater to know how to get on board; as fhe
lay aground an J high out of the water, there was no-
thing within my reach, to lay hold of; I f.vam round
her twice, and the fecond time I eipied a fmall piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not fee at firft, hang down
by the tore chains, fo low, as with great difficulty I got
hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got up into
the fore-cattle of the lliip. Here I found that the flap
was bilged, and a great deal of water in the hold, but
that Hie lay lb on the fide of a bank of hard fand, or
rather earth, that her Hern lay lifted up upon the bank,
and her head low aim oil: to the water; by this means all
her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry, for you may be fure my work was to fearch, and to
fee what was fpoilt and what was free: And fir ft 1 found,
that all the imp's provisions were dry, and untouched by
the water; and, being very well difpofed to eat, i went
to the bread room, and filled my pockets with bifcuit,
and eat it as I went about other things, for I had no time
to loll*. I alio found Ibme rum in the great cabin, of
which i took a large dram, and which I had indeed need
enough of, to ipint me for what was before me. Now
I wanted nothing but a boat, to furniih myfelf with
many things which I foreiaw would be very neceflaiy
to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was not
to be had; and this extremity roufed my application.
We had several jpare yard;, and two or three large
fpars of wood, a ad a jpare top-mail or two in the
(hip; I re folved to fall to worlt with thefe, and (lung
as many of them overboard as I could manage for their
weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might
not drive away; when this was done, 1 went down the
fhip's fide, and pulling them to me, I tied four of
them faft together at both ends as well as I could, in
the form of a raft; and, laying two or three ihort
pieces of plank upon,them crofs-ways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
any
 
 
 
any great weight, the pieces being too light; fo I went,
to 'work, and "with a carpenter's law 1 cut a fpare cop-
mail into three lengths, and added them to my raft,
with a <n eat deal of labour and pains; but the hope
of fur milling my felt with neceflarics, encouraged me to
go beyond what I mould have been able to have done
upon another occaiion.
* My raft was now ilrong enough to bear any reafbn-
nbh: 'weight; mv next cafe was what to load it with,
and how to prelcrve what I laid upon it from the large
of the lea i but I was not long confidering this: I fir it
laid ail the planks or boards upon it that I could get;
and having confidered well what I molt wanted, I fir it
;:ot three "of the feawens chcils, which I had broken
open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my
r.iit; the fir it of thefc I filled with provifions, viz.
bread, rice, three Dutch ciieefes, five pieces of dried
goat's Helb, which we lived much upon, and a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by
for feme fowls which we brought to fea with us, but
the fowls were killed; there had been fome barley and
tvheat together, but, to my great di {appointment, I
found afterwards, that the rats had eaten or fpoiled it
all. As for liquors, I found feveral cafes of bottles
belonging to our fkipper, in which were fome cordial
waters, and in all about five or fix gallons of arrack;
thefe I ilo.vcd by themfelves, there being no need to
put them into the cheft, nor any room for them. While
1 was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though
very calm, and i had the mortification to fee my coat,
ihirt, and waiitcoat, which I had left on more upon
the land, iwiin away; as for my breeches, which were
only linen, end open kneed, 1 fvvarn on board in them
and my itockings: however, this put rae upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no m- re than 1 wanted for the prefent ufe, for I had
other things which my eye w as more upon; as firfl
tools to work with on more, and it was after lono-
fearching tint 1 found out the carpenter's cheit, which
was indeed a very ufeful prize to me, and much more
valuable than a ihip laden with gold would have been at
that time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it
Vol, L C was
 
was without lofing time to look into it, for I knew In
general what it contained.
My next care was for fome ammunition and arms •
IT ere were two very good fowling pieces in the great
c^bin, and two piftols; thefe I fecured nrfr, with fomc
p:.wder horns, a fmall bag of foot* and two old rufty
v.ords: J knew there were three barrels of powder in
he (hip, but knew not where our gunner had flowed
hem; but with much fearch I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken water; thefe two I
got to my raft, with the arms: and now I thought my
ft If pretty ^well freighted and began to think how I
ihould get to more with them, having neither fail, oar,
or rudder, and the leafl cap full of wind would have
overfet all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: i a fmooth and calm fea.
2 The tide rifing and letting in to the more. 3 What
little wind there was blew me towards the land. And
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to
the boat, and beiides the tools which were in the cheft,
1 found two faws, an ax, and a hammer; and with
this cargo I put to fea; for a mile, or thereabouts, my
raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
diftant from the place where I had landed before; by
which I perceived that there was fome indraught of the
water, and confequently I hoped to find fome creek of
the river there, which I might make ufe of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, fo it was; there appeared before me a
little opening of the land. I found a ftrong current of
the tide fet into it, fo I guided my raft as well as I
could to keep in the middle of the dream: but here I
had like to have fufFered a fecond Ihipwreck, which, if
I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for,
knowing nothing of tne coaft, my raft ran aground at
one end of it upon a lhoaJ, and not being aground at
the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo
had flipped off towards that end that was afloat, and fo
fallen into the water; I did my utmoft by fetting my
back againft the chefts, to keep them in their places,
bat could not thruft off the raft with all my ftrength;
neither durfl I ftir from the pofture I was in, but, holding
 
 
 
up the chells with all my might, Hood in that manner
near half an hour, in which time the riling of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and a
little after,"the water ftill riling, my raft floated again,
and I thruil her off with the oar I had, into the channel,
and then driving up higher, I at length found inyfelf in
the mouth of a little'river, with land on both fides,
and a flrcng current of tide running up. I looked on
both fides for a proper place to get to more, for I was
not willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping
in time to°fee lome fliip at fea, and therefore refolved tci
place msfllf as near the coaft a;> L could.
At length i efpied a little cove on the right (bore of
the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I
guided my raft; and at lail gotfonear, as that, reaching
ground with my oar, I could thruil her diredtly in; but
here i had like to have dipped all my cargo in the fea
again; for that fhore lying pretty fleep, that is to lay,
doping, there was no place to land, but where one end
of the float, if it ran on fliorc, would lie fo high, and
the other fink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cargo again: all that I could do was to wait till
the tide was at the highefl, keeping the raft with my
oar, like an anchor, to hold the fide of it fall to the
fhore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the
water would flow over, and fo it did; as ioon as I found
water enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water)
I thruil her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
f uilcned, or moored her, by flicking my two broken oars
into the ground; one on one fide near one end, and one
o 1 the o'her fide near the other end; and thus I lay till
the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo
fafe on more.
My next work was to view the country, and feek z
proper place for my habitation, and where to How my
goods, to fecure them from whatever might happen.
Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent,
or on an iHand; whether inhabited, or not inhabited;
whether in danger of wild hearts, or not. There was a
hill not above a mile from me, which rofe up very fteep
and high, and which fee me d to overtop fome other hills
which lay as in a ridge from it northward; I took out
C z one
 
 
 
 
one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the piftols, and
a horn of powder, and thus armed, I travelled for dif-
covery up to the top of that hill, where, after 1 had -vi tlx
great labour and difficult;.' got up, I immediately faw
my fate, to my great affliction; viz. that I w. s n\ an
ifland environed every way with the fen, no land to be
feen, except fome rocks, wnich lay a p;rcat way off, and
two fin all iflands lels than this, vvhkh lay about tnree
leagues to the Weft
I found alfo drat the ifland 1 was in was barren, and,
as I faw good seaibn to believe, uninhabited, except by
wild bcails, of which, however, I faw none; yet I faw
abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds, neither,
when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food,
and what not. At my coming back, 1 (hot at a great
bird which I faw fitting upon a tree on the fide of a
large wood; I believe it was the fir ft gun that had been
fired there flnce the creation of the world. I had no
fooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there
arofe an extraordinary number of fowls of many forts,
making a confuted fcreaming and crying, every one ac-
cording to his ufual note; but not one of them of any
kind that I knew: As for that cFeature 1 killed, I took
it to be a kind of an hawk, its colour and beak refem-
bling it, but it had no talons or claws more than com-
mon: its flefh was carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this difcovcry, 1 came back to my
jraft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on fhore,
which took me up the reft of the day; what to do with
myfelf at night, 1 knew not, nor indeed where to reft;
for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not know-
ing but fome wild bear! might devour me, tho* I after-
wards found, there was really no need for thofe fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myfelf
round with the chefls and boards that I had brought on
fhore, and made a kind of an hut. for that night's lodg*
ing; as for food, I yet faw not which way to fupply my-
felf, except that I had feen two or three creatures like
hares, run out of the wood where I fhot the fowl.
I now began to coniider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the fliip, which would be
wfeful to me, and particularly fome of the rigging and
fails
 
 
iaiis, and fuch other things as might come to hand; and
I iefolved to make another voyage on board the vcfiel,
if poflible; and as I knew that the fir ft ftorm that blew
mult neceiiarily break her all in pieces, I refolvcd to fet
all other things apart, till I got every thing out of the
Ihip that 1 could get; then I called a council, that is to
fay', in my thoughts, whether 1 mould take back the
iait, but this appeared impraclk-able; fo I refoived to
go as before, when the tide was down; and 1 did lo,
oniy that I ilripped heroic I went from my hut, having
nothing on but a chequered ftiirt, a pair oflinen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on tny feet.
I got on board the ihip as before, and prepared a fe~
cond rait; and, having had experience of the firft, I
neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded it k> hn.ru;
but yet 1 brought away feveral things very ufeful to me;
as fir ft, in the carpenter's ft ore I found two or three bags
of nails and t^ikes, a great fcrew jack, a dozen or
two of hatchets, and ajove all, that moil ui"c:m ih-r.g
called a grindiione: all thefe I fecured, together with
ieveral things belonging to the gunner, particularly two
or three iron crows, and two barrels of mufket-buUets,
feven mulkets and another fowling-piece, with feme
imaii quantity of powder more, a large bag full of fin ail
mot, and a great roll of meet lead; but this la ft was fo
heavy 1 could not hoi ft it up to get it over the lhip's fide.
lie fides thefe things, I cook all the men's cloaths that
J could find, and a fpare fore-top fail, hammock, and
iome bedding ; and with this I loaded my fecond rafr,
and brought them alio all fafe on ihore, to my very
great comfort.
I was under fome apprehenfions during my abfence
from the land, that at lea ft my provifions might be de-
voured on fhore; but when I came back, I found no
*ign of any vifcor, only there fat a creature like a wild
cat, upon one of the chelts, which, when i came to-
wards it, ran away to a little diftance, and then flood
Hill; ihe iat very compofed and unconcerned, and looked
full in my face, as if (he had a mind to be acquainted
with me. 1 prefented my gun at her, but (he did not
underitand it, ihe was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor
<U4 &e offer to ftir away; upon which 1 toffed her a bit
C j of
 
 
of bifcuit, though by the way I was not very free of it,
for my ftore was not great. However, I fpared her a
bit, 1 fay, and the went to it, fmelied of it, and eat it,
and looked (as pleafed) for more; but I thanked her,
and could fpare no more, fo flic marched off.
Having got my iecond cargo on more (though I was
fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by
Kneels, lor they were too heavy, being large calks) I
went 10 work to make a little tent with the fail, and Tome
pules which I cut for that purpofe, and into this tent I
b rough r every thing that I knt\v would ipoil, either with
lain or h:n; J piled all the empty cheils and cafks up
\'\ a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any fuddea
attempt, either from man or heaiL
Vvj.cn 1 had ;'one this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with fome beards within, and an empty cheft fet
up an end without , and Iprending one of the beds upon
the ground, laying my two pi Hols jtiil at rny head, and
•r.y t;;rs l'c istunh by rr.c, i went to bed for the iiril
time, and ilept ve ry quietly ail night: I was very weary
and heavy, tor the night before 1 had llept but little, and
had laboured very hard ail day, as well to fetch thole
things from the fhip, as to get them on more.
I had the biggcil magazine of all kinds now that ever
were laid up, 1 believe, for one man ; but I was not fa-
tisficd iHU; for while the fhip fat upright in that porture,
1 thought 1 ought to get every thing out of her that 1
could; fo every d'ty at low water I went on board, and
brought away Something or other: but particularly the
third time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as L could, as alio ail the fmall ropes and rope-
twine I could get, with a piece of fpare canvas, which
was to mend the fails upon occafion, and the barrels of
wet gunpowder; in a word, 1 brought away all the
fa Lb firlt and kit, only that I was fain to cut them in
pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for
they wese no more ufeful to me fo*- fails, but as mere
canvas only.
But that which comforted me more ftill, was, that at
Jail of all, after I had made five or fix fuch voyages as
thefe, and thought I had nothing more to expect from
the fhip, that was worth mediing with; I fay, after
all
 
 
 
all this, I found a great hog (head of bread, three large
rundlets-of rum, or fpirits, a box of fine fugar, and a
barrel of fine flour; this was furprifmg to me. be-
caufe I had given over expecting any more provisions,
except what was fpoiled by the water. I ftxm emptied
the hog (head of that bread, and wrapt it up, parcel by
parcel, in pieces of the fails, which I cut out: and, m
a word, I got all this iafe on fnore alfo, though at feverui
times.
The next day T made another voyage, and now hav-
ing plundered the lhip of what was portable, and fit to
hand out, I began with the cables, and cutting the great
cable into pieces, fuch as I could move, I got two
cables and an hawfer oa more, with all the iron-work
T could get; and having cut down the fprit-faii yard
and the mizen-yard, and every thing I could to make a
large raft, 1 loaded it with all thofe heavy goods, and
came away: but my good luck began to leave me, for
this raft was fo unwieldy, and fo overladen, that after I
was entered the little cove, where I had landed the reft
of my goods, not being able to guide it fo handily as £
did the other, it overfet, and threw me and all my car-
go into the water; as for myfelf, it was no great harm,
for I was near the more; but as to my cargo, it was
great part of it loft, efpecially the iron, which 1 expe&ed
would have been of great ufe to me; however, when
the tide was out, I got moft of the pieces of cable
afhore, andfome of the iron, though with infinite labour,
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much ; after this, I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could get.
I had been 13 days on fhore, and had been eleven
times on board the fhip; in which time 1 had brought
away all that one pair of hands could well be fuppofed
capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the calm
weather held, 1 mould have brought away the whole
fhip, piece by piece; but preparing the twelfth time
to go on board, I found the wind began to rife 5 how-
ever, at low water, I went on board, and tho' I thought
I had rummaged the cabin fo effectually, as that nothing
more could be found, yet I difcovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
C 4 razors,
 
 
razors, and one pair of large fciffars, with ten or a do-
zen good knives and forks; in another I found about
thirty-fix pounds value in money, feme European coin,
fbme Jfirafil, fome pieces of eight/fome gold and feme
filver.
1 fin i led to myfelf at the fight of this money. O
drug! laid I aloud, what art thou good for? Thou art
not worth to me, no, not the taking off the ground;
one of thofe knives is worth all this heap; I have no
manner of ufe for thee; e'en remain where thou art,
and go to the bottom, as a creature whole life is not
worth faving; however, upon kcond thoughts, I
took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of can-
vas, 1 began to think of mnking another raft, but
while I was preparing this, 1 found the Iky overcaft,
and the wind began to rife, and in a auarter of an hour
I! I ?ici'u gale irom urn more; it prcienuy oc-
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a
raft, with the wind off more, and that it was rny bu-
fmefs to be gone before the tide of flood began, other-
wife I might not be able to reach the ihore at all; ac-
cordingly I let myfelf down into the water, and fwam
acrols the channel, which lay between the (hip and the
fand, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with
the weight of the things I hat* about me, and partly
the roughnefs of the water, for the wind rote very
haih'ly,"and before it was quite high water, it blew a
ftorm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay
with all my wealth about me very fecure; it blew very
hard all that night, and in the morning, when I looked
out, behold, no more fhip was to be feen. 1 was a
little furprifed, but recovered myfelf with this fatisfac-
tory reflection; viz. that I had loft no time, nor abated
any diligence, to get every thing out of her that could
be ufeful to me; and that indeed there was little left
in her that J was able to bring away, if I had yet
more time. I now gave over any more thought of
the fhip, or of any thing out of her, except what might
drive on more from her wreck; as indeed divers pieces
of her afterwards did, but thofe things were of imali
life to me.
 
My thoughts were now wholly employed about fe-
curing myfeif again!! either favaget, if any mould ap-
pear, or wild hearts, it any were in the i and; and 1 had
manv thoughts of a method how to do this, and what
kind of dwelling to make, whether f iliould make me a
cave in th-* enrsh, or a tent upon the earth: and, in
fhort, 1 revived *jpon bo.di ; the manner and description,
of which it may not be improper to give an account of,
I loon found the place I was in was not for my fet-
tlement, particuiarly becauie it was upon a low moorifh
ground near the feu, and I believed would not be whol-
ibroe, ajud more particularly becaufe there was no water
near it; io I reioived to find a more healthy and more
convenient ipot of ground.
I confahed feveral things in my fit nation, which I
found would be proper for me -y firft, health, and fre(h
water, as I juR now mentioned; fecondly, Ihelter from
the heat of the fun; thirdly, fecurity from ravenous
creatures, whether man or beaft j fourthly,, a view to
the ica, that if God fent any fhip in fight, I might not
lofe any advantage of my deliverance, for which I was.
mot willing to banifti my expectation yet.
In feach of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the fide of a rifing hill, whofe form towards
this little plain, was as iieep as an houfe fide, fo that
nothing could come down upon me from the top; on
the fide of this rock there was an hollow place, worn
a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave,
but there was not really any cave or way into the rock
at ail.
On the flat of the green, juft before this hollow
place, I refolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about twice as
long, and lay like a green before the door, and at the
end of it deicended irregularly every way down into
the low grounds by the fea.&de. It was on the N. N*%
W. fide of the hill, fo that it was fheltered from the
heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. fun, or
thereabouts, which in thole countries is near the fet-
ting#
Before I fet up my tent, 1 drew an half circle before
the hollow place, which took in about tea yards in its
C 5 fenai* -
 
femidiameter fiom the rock, and twenty yards in Its
diameter, from its beginning and Gliding.
In this half circle 1 pitched two rows of flrong Hakes,
driving them into the ground till they Hood very firm,
like piles, the biggeft end being out of the ground above
Ave feet and an half, and fharpened on the top, the two
rows did not Hand above fix inches from one another.
Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I had cut in
the ihip, and laid them in rows upon one another, with*
in the circle, between thofe two rows of Hakes, up to
the top, placing other Hakes in the infide, leaning
againH them, about two feet and a half high, like a
fpur to a poll; and this fence was fo flrong, that nei-
ther man or beafl could get into it, or over it. This coll
me a great deal of time and labour, efpecially to cut
the piles in the wood, bring then to the place, and
drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a
door, but by a fhort ladder to go over the top; which
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me; and ib
I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,
from all the world, and confequently flept fecure in the
flight, which, other wife, 1 could not have done; though
as it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies I had apprehended danger
from.
Into this fence, cr fortrefs, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provifions, ammunition,
and Hares, of which you have the account above; and
I made me a large tent alio, to preserve me from the
rains, that in one part of the year are very violent there*
I made it double; viz. one fmaller tent within, and
one larger tent above it * and covered the uppermoH
part of it with a large tarpaulin, which 1 had laved
among the fails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which
I had brought on more, but in an hammock, which was
indeed a very good cue, and belonged to the mate of
thefhip.
Into this tent I brought all my provifions, and every
thing that would fpoil by the wet; and having thus
iacloied all my goods, 1 made up the entrance, which
tin
 
 
 
 
till now I had left open, and fo palled and repaffed, as
I laid, by a fhort ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into
the rock, and bringing all the earth and ftones that I
dug down, out through my tent, I laid them up within
my fence in the nature of a terrace, fo that it raifed the
ground within about a foot and an half; and thus I
made a cave juil behind my tent, which ferved me like
a cellar to my houie
It coll me much labour, and many days, before all
thefe things were brought to perfection; and therefore
I mult go back to fome other things which took up
jfome of my thoughts. At the fame time it happened,
after I had laid my fcheme for letting up the tent,
and making the cave, that a ilorm of rain falling from
a thick dark cloud, afudden flam of lightning happened,
and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally
the effect of it, I was not fo much furprifed with the
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into
i?iy mind as Iwift as the lightning itfelf. O my pow-
der 1 My very heart funk within me, when I thought,
that at one blait all my powder might be deitroyed, on
which, not niy defence only, but the providing r.ie food,
as I thought, entirely depended; 1 was nothing near io
anxious about my o*vn danger, though, had the powder
look fire* I had never known who ha J hurt me.
Such imprelli ui did this make upon me, that after
the itorra was over,. 1 laid afide all my work, my build-
ing and fortifying, and applied myfelf to make b.M;4
and boxes to fcparate my powder, and to keep it a little
and a little in a parcel, in hopes, that whatever might
come, it might not ail take lire at once, and to keep" fo
apart, that it Oijuld not be poilibie to make one p;.,*t
fire another. I fmi-fhed this work in a boat a fortnight,
and I think my powder, which in. all was about 140k).
weight, was divided into no lefs than an hundred par-
cels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not
apprehend any danger Jjoajt that, fo I placed it in my
new cave, which in my fancy I calied my kitchen; aid
the reft I hid up and down in holes among the rocks,
fo that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I. laid u« •
C6 jft
 
 
 
In the Interval of time while this was doing , I went
out at leaft once every day with my gun, as well to di-
vert myfelf, as to fee if I could kill any thing fit for
food, and, as near as T could, to acquaint myfelf with
what the ifland produced. The firII time I vve.it out, I
prcfcntly difcovered that there wej-e goats in the ifland,
which was a great fat is fact ion to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me, viz. That they
were fo my, fo fubtie, and fo fvvift a foot, that it was
the difficulteft thing in the world to come at them; but
I was not difcouraged at this, not doubting but I might
now and then moot one, as it foon happened; for after
I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this man-
ner for them: I obferved, if they faw me in the valleys,
though they were upon the rock$, they would run away
as in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the
valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no no-
tice of me; from whence I concluded, that by the por-
tion of their optics, their fight was fo direded down-
ward, that they did not readily fee objecls that were
above them; fo afterwards I took this method: 1 al-
ways climbed the rocks fir ft, to get above them, and
then had frequently a fair mark. The fir it lliot I made
among thefe creatures, I killed a fhe go:it which had a
little kid by her, which Ihe gave fuck to, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid flood
flock Hill by her till I came and took her up, and not
only fo, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my moulders, the kid followed me quite to my inclo-
fure; upon which 1 laid down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes
to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat; fo I was
jfbrced to kill it, and eat it myfelf: thefe two fupplied
mc wirh flefh a great while, for I eat fparingly, and
iaved my proviliens (my bread efpecially) as much as
poffibly 1 could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abfo-
lately necefTary to provide a place to make a fire in, and
fuel to burn j and what I did for that, as alfo hew I
inlarged my cave, and what conveniencies I made, I
Hi all give a full account of in its place; but I mult fir ft
give fome little account of myfelf, and of my thoughts
a uo tit
 
about living, which it may be well fuppoild were not a
few.
I had a difmal profpe&of my condition; for as I was
not call away upon that ill and, without being driven, ^3
is laid, by a violent florin, quite out of the cow.e of our
intended voyage, and a great way, viz. fome hundreds
of leagues out. of the ordinary courieof the trade of man -
kind,*! had great renion to confider it as a determination
of heaven, that in this defoiate place, and in this def-
late manner, 1 mould end my lite. The tears would run
plentifully down my face when i made thefe refk-clion>;
and lometimes J would expostulate with myfeif, why
Providence mould thus completely ruin its creatures,
and render them fo abfolutely inferable, fo without
help abandoned, and fo entirely deprefied, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for fuc.h a liie.
But fomething aUvays returned fwift upon me to check
thefe thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly
one day, walking with my gun in ray hand, by die lea-
fide, ! was very pen five upon the fubjefl of my prefent
condition, when rcaf n, ns it were, put in, expoftuJating;
with me t'other way, thus: Well, you are in a defolate
condition, tis true; but pray remember, where y.e the
reft of you? Did not there come eleven of yon into the
boat r Where ar j the ten? Why were not Uiey faved,
and you loll? Why are you fingled out I h it better to
be here or there? And then 1 pointed to the fea. All
evils are be confidered with the good that is in them,
and with what worfe attended them.
Then it occur'd to $ne again, how well I was furnifh'd
for my fubhilei.ee, and what would have beer*, my cafe,
if it had n*a happened, which w^as an hundred theufar.d
to one, that the fhip floated from the place where iiril fhe
firuck, and was driven fo near to the more, that I had
time to g all thefe things out of her 1 V hat would
have ha n my cafe, if! had been to ha e lived in the
condition in which I at fir It came on fir e, without ne-
ceffarics of life, or any means to fu| . - and procure
them r Particularly, laid I alo^i, tho' r nyielf, what
would I have done without a gun, withou- im munition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to woik with?
Without
 
Without cloaths, bedding, a tent, or any manner of
covering? And that now I had all thefe to a fnificient
quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myfelf in
iiicha manner, as to live without my gun when my am-
munition was fpent, io that I had a tolerable view of
fubfifting without any want as long as I lived; for I con-
fidered, from the beginning, how I mould provide for the
accidents that might: happen, and for the time that was
to come, even not only after my ammunition mould be
fpent, but alfo after my health or ilrength mould decay,
I confefs I had not then entertained any notion of my
ammunition being deilroyed at one blaft, I mean my
powder being blown up by lightning; and this made the
thoughts of it furprizing to me, when it lightened and
thundered, as I obferved juft now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation
of a Icene of filent life, fuch perhaps as was never
heard of in the world before, J lhall take it from its be-
ginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my ac-
count, the 30th of September, when, in the manner as
above laid, 1 ririt let foot upon this horrid illand, when
the fun being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almuit
jail over my head; for I reckoned myfelf, by obfervation,
to be in the latkudc of 9 degrees, 22 min. fouth of the
line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts that I mould lofe my reckon-
ing of time tor want or books, and pen, and ink, and
mould even forget the labbath days from the working
days. But to prevent this, J cut it with my knife, upon
a large poit, in capital letters, and making it into a
great crols, I fet it up on the more where I firll landed,
viz. I came on ihore here the 30th of September, 1659.
Upon the fides of this fquare poll 1 cut every day a
notch with my knife, and every ieventh notch was as.
1 mg again as the re It, and every full day of the month
as long again as that long one ; and thus I kept my ca-
lendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of
time.
In the next place we are to obferve, that among the
many things that 1 brought from the fhip in the fe ve-
ra! voyages, which, as above-mentioned, 1 made to it, I
.got
 
 
got feveral things of lefs value, but not at all left ufeful
to me, which I omitted fetting down before; as in par-
ticular, pens, ink, and paper, feveral parcels in the cap-
tain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three
or four compares, fome mathematical inflruments, dials,
perfpeciives, charts, and books of navigation, all which
I huddled together, whether I might want them or not;
I alfo found three very good bibles, which came to me
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things ; fome Portuguese books alio, and
among them, two or three pcpifh prayer-books, and le-
ver al other books, all which 1 carefully fecured. And I
mull not forget that we had in the ihip a dog and two
cats, of whofe eminent hiftory I mult have occafion to
fay fomething in its place; for I carried both the cats
with me, and as for the dog, he jumped out of the Ihip
of mmieif, a;.d fwam on fliore to me, the day after I went
on more with my firil cargo, and was a truity fervant to
me many years. I wanted nothing that he could fetch,
me; nor any company that he could make up to me; I
only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. As 1 obferved before, I found pens, ink, and
paper, and I huibanded them to the utmoit, and I mall
mew, that while my ink lafted, I kept things very exadt,
but after that was gone, I could not; for I could not
make any ink, by any means that I could get.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amaffed together; and of
thefe, this of ink was one; as alfo a fpade, pick-axe, and
(hovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and
thread; as for linen, I foon learned to want that, with-
out much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had en-
tirely finifhed my little pale, or furrounded habitation:
The piles or flakes, which were as heavy as I could
w ell lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in
the woods, and more by far in bringing home; io that
I fpent iometimes two days in cutting ana bringing home
one of thofe pofts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpofe I got a heavy piece of
wood at firft, but at laft bethought myfelfcf one of the
iron
 
iron crows, which however, though i found, It yet mace
driving ihoie polls* or piles, very laborious and tedious
work.
But what need I to have been concerned at the tediouf-
nets ef any thing I Had to do, feeing 1 had time enough
to do it in? Nor had i any other employment, if that

I now began fenoufly to con fid er my condition, and

ihore, that I. have gotten out

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted .teitimony,

ail conditions in this world, that we may r.iwr.ys find
in it fomething to comfort ourfelves fiom, and to fet, in
the description of good and evil, on the credit fide of
the account.
Having now brought my rnirnd a little to reliih my
condition, and giving over looking out to lea, to Ice if
J cor.ld fpy a fliip; I fay, giving over thefe things, [
began to apply mWclf 10 accommodate my way oi'liv-
ing, and to make tilings as eafy to me as I cculd.
1 nave already defcribed my habitation, which was a
tent under the fide of a roek, furrounded svitii a llrong
pale of polls and cables, but I might now rather call it
a wall j for I railed a kind of wail up aga'mfl it of turfs »
about two feet thick on the outline; ar.d after tome time,
(I think it was a year and an half) I railed rafters from
it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with
boughs of trees, and fuch nines as i could get to keep
out the rain, which 1 found at fome times of the year
very violent.
1 have already obfei ved how I brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which f had made be-
hind me. But 1 mull nbferve too, that, at mil, this was
a con-
ADVENTURES OF
a confufed heap of goods, which, as they lay in no or-
der, fa they took up all rny place; I had no room to
turn myfelf, fa I let myfelf to enlarge my cave, and
wurked fai ther into the earth; for it was a loofe {z.ndy
rock, which yielded eaiily to the labour I bellowed on it:
And fo, when I found I was pretty fafe as to beafts of
prey, I worked tideways to the right-hand into the rock,
an 1 then turning to the right-hand again, worked quite
out, and made my door to come out on the outfide of
my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egrefs and regrefs, as it was
a back way to my tent, and to my llore-houfe, but gave
me room to How my goods.
And now I began to apply myfelf to make fuch necef-
fary things as I found I melt wanted, particularly a chair
and a table; for without thefe I was not able to enjoy
the few comforts I h&u in the world j I could not write
or eat, or do feveral thing, with fa much pleafure, with-
out a table.
So I went to work; and here I muft needs obferve,
that as reafbn is the fubilance and origin of the mathe-
matics, fo, by Hating and fquaring every thing by rea-
fon, and by making the moil rational judgment of things,
every man may be, in time, mailer of every mechanic
art. I had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in
time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found
at lafl, that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
efpecially if I had had tools; however, I made abun-
dance of things even without tools, and fome with no
more tools than an adze and an hatchet, which perhaps
were never made that way before, and that with infinite
labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no
other way but to cut down a tree, fet it on an edge be-
fore me, and hew it flat one ither fide with my axe, till
I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub
it fmooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but this
I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it
took me up to make a plank or board. But my time or
labour was little worth, and fo it was as well employed
one way as another.
However?
 
 
However, I made me a table and achair? as I obferved
above, in the fu ll place, and this I did out of the fhort
pieces uf boards that I brought on any raft from the fhip.
But when I had wrought out fomc boards as above, I
made large iheives of the breadth of a foot and an half,
one over another, all along one fide of my cave, to lay
all my tools, nails, and iron work, and, in a word, to
feparate every tiling at large in their places, that I might
eaiily come at them; I alio knocked pieces into the wall
of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would
hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be fcen, it looked like
a general magazine of all nectfFary things; and I had
every thing io ready at hand, that it was a great pica-
it re to me to fee all my goods in fuch order, and cfpe-
cially to find my flock of all neceiTaries io great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at £r£t 1 was irt too
milch hurry, and not only an hurry as to labour, but in
too mrch difcompofure of mind, and my journal vvould
have been full of many dull things, For example, I
mult have faid thus: Sept. the 30th, after 1 #ot to more,
and had efcaped drowning, in Head of bei . ; thankful to
God for my deliverance, having firft v mitted with a
great quantity of fait-v ater, which was gotten into my
iiomach, and recovering myfelf a little, I ran about the

face, exclaiming at my mifery, and crying out, I was
im lone, undone 1 till, died and faint, I was forced to lie
down on the ground for repute, but dunl not fleep for
fear of being devoured.
borne days after this, and after I had been on board
the ihip, and had got all I could out of her, yet I could
not forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain,
and looking out to lea, in hopes of feeing a fhip, then
fancy at a vail diflance I efpied a fail, p J cafe myfelf with
the hopes of it, and then after looking Readily till I was
almoft blind, iofe it quite, and fit down and weep like a
child, and thus increafe my mifery by my folly.
But having gotten over thefe things in fome mea-
fure, and having fettled my houfhold UufF and habita-

TME JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. I, poor mtumble RobinSm
Crufoe, being ihipwiecked during a dicaatul ilouu ni
the ofling, came on (hore on this difmai and unfortunate
iiland, which I call the I Hand of Dsfpair, all the r;<\ of
the (hip's company being drowned; and iny ft if almdt
All the rcfl of the day I fpent in afflicting royfelf nr
the difmai circumitances 1 was brought to, v.'*/,. 1 had
neither food, houfe, cloaths, weapon, or place to fiy to,
and, in defpair of any relief, favv nothing but death be-
fore me, either that I lhould be devoured by wild beafts,,
murdered by favagcs,or itarved to death for want of food.
At the approach of night, I fiept in a tree, for fear of
wild creatures, but flept foundly, tho' it raided ail night,
October 1. In the morning I taw, to my great furprife,
the (hip had floated with the high tide, and was oriven
on more again much nearer the ifland; which, as it
was fame comfort on one hand for feeing her fit up-
right, and not broken in pieces- 1 hoped, if the wind
abated, I might get on board, and get fome food and
neceffanes out of her for my reliet) fo, on the other
hand, it renewed my grief, at the J of* or my comrades*
who, I imagined, if we had all (laid on board, might
have faveu tne (hip, or at lean1, that they would not have
been ail drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been iaveJ, we might, perhaps, have built tis a boat out
of the ruins of the Ihip, to have carried us to fome
other part of the world, 1 fpent great part of this day
in perpl-x<ng myfelf on thete things; but at length,
feeing the ihip almoft dry, I went On thefand as near
 
 
 
 
-as I could, and then iwam cn bo?rd: This clay alio
couu'nutd mining, though with no wmd at all.
brum the :il oJ CXfoher to the 24th, All theie days
cnt-rtly ipuit in making it veal voyages to get all I
c uld out oftheih.p, which 1 biouglv on thore ever/
tide of flood, eron 1 a t -. iVnch iam al:o on theie days,
?h,v:;.d; v.i'h feme inter vaL of ht'.r weather. But it fecras
this was the rainy feafon.
Cel. .4. I cvenec iny rafr, and a;l the goods I had
^nf vipjn it; hut being in Ihoa! water, and the things
btdnp chu;ily heavy, 1 recovered many of them when
the tide was out.
Oc 2q It rained all night and all day, with fbme
gu:L (.? w n L during which time the fhip broke in piece?,
the vvinu b.'ov-.ing a little harder than before, and was
no mere t > be ieeru e xcept the wreck of her, and that
onh at !o v w..ter. I fpent this day in covering andfe-
cu« i.*g Jh good's winch I hadfaved, that the ram might
not :p '} them.
OvL 2'-. 1 wa' ke-,1 about the fhore almofl all day, to
find out a ph.ee to fix my habitation, g;e* ly concerned
t»> fecure my {'elf from any attack in the night,either from
uiid bcaiU or men. Towards night I ftxe*-i upon a pro-
per plat..; under a rock, a:ij marked out a feinicircle for
my encamrrnent. which I ref>' ved to Hire;-gthen with a
wore, wail, or fortification, made of double piles, lined
within with c..b!e, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in car-
rying all my goods to my new habitation, though fome
part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 3 1 ft, in the morning, I went out into the ifland
with my gun to fee for fome food, and difcover the coun-
try, when I killed a ihe goat, and her kid followed me
home, which 1 afterwards killed alfo, becaufe it would
not feed.
November 1. 1 fet up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the ftril night, making it as large as I could,
with flakes driven in to fvving my hammock upon.
Nov 2. I let up all my cheits and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my raft, and with them
formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had
marked out for my fortification.
Nov,
Nov, 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the
afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov*. 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of goi ig out with my gun, time of fleep, and
time of diverfion, viz. Every morning I walked out
with my pun for two or three hours, if it did not rain;
then employed myfelf at work till about eleven o'clock;
then e.it what 1 had to live on; and from twelve to tw®
i lay down to fleep, the weather being excefllve ho:,
mid then in the evening to work again. The working
part of this dny and the next were wholly employed in
making this tabic, for 1 was but yet a very lorry work-
111a 1, tho' time and neceffity made me a complete na-
tural mechanic loon after, as I believe it would do any
one elfe.
Nov. 5. This day J went abroad with my gun and
dog, and killed a w!ld cat, her ikia pretty loft, but
fujr flelh good for nothing. Every creature I killed I took
off the (kins and preserved them. Coming back by the
fen-more I law many forts of fea-fowls which I did not
undeniaiul; but was furprifed, and alniolt affr ighted,
with two or three fe ds, which, while 1 was gazing at, not
well knowing what they were, got into the ka, and
eicaped me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with
my table again, and finiihed it, tho' not to my liking;
nor was it long before I learned to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair weather. The
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and part of the i 2th (for the nth
was Sunday according to my reckoning) 1 took wholly
up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to
a tolerable fliape but never to pleafe me; and even in
the making I pulled it to pieces leveral times.—Note, I
foon neglected keeping Sundays; for omitting my mark
for them on my poll, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreftied me ex-
ceedingly, and cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me
dreadfully for fear of my powder. As foon as it was over,
I refolved to feparate my flock of powder into as many
little parcels as poflible, that it might not be in danger.
Nov
 
Nov. 14, 15, 16. Thefe three days 1 fpent in mak-
ing little fquarc cneits or boxes, which might hold about
a pound, or two pounds at moft, of powder; and ib put-
ting the powder in, I flowed it in places as fecure and
remote from one another as pofhble. On one of theie
three days i killed a large bird that was good to eat,
but I knew not what to call it.
Nov* 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my farther conveniency.
Note, Three things I wanted exceedingly for this wojk,
viz. A pick-axe, a (hovel, and a wheel-barrow, or
hafket; fo I defifled from my work, and began to con-
lider how to fupply that want, and make me tome
tools. As for the pick axe, i made uie of the iron-
crows, which were proper enough, though 1 e ivy; but
tne next thing was a move!, or fpade; this was fo ab-
lol Jtely neceffary, that indeed 1 could do nothing effec-
*a!ly without it, but what kind of one to make 1 knew
not.
Nov. 18, The next day, in fearching the wcods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the lira-
fils they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hardness;
of this, with great labour, and almolt fpoiling my axe,
1 cut a piece, and brought it home with difficulty
enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The exceffive hardnefs 01 the wood, and having no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine;
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into the
form of a fhovel or fpade, the haddle exactly fhaped
like ours in England, only that the broad part having
no iron mod upon it at bottom, it wojald not laft me fo
long; however, it ferved well enough for the ufes which
1 had occaiion to put it to; but never was a fhovel, I
believe, made after that fafhion, or fo long a making,
I was /till deficient, for 1 wanted a bafket or wheel.
barrow: a bafket I could not make by any means, hav-
ing no fuch things as twigs that would bend to make
wicker-ware, at lead none yet found out; and as to the
wheel-barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel;
but that J had no notion cf, neither did I know how to
go about it; beiides, I had no poflible way to make
iron gudgeons for the fpindle, or axis, of the wheel to
run
 
run in ;. fo I gave it over; and fo, for carrying away
the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a
thing like an hod, which the labourers carry mortar in
when they ferve the bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making of the
{hovel; and yet this, and the ihovel, and the attempt
which 1 made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took me
up no lefs than four days; I mean always^excepting
my morning's walk with my gun, which I feldom failed;
and very leldom failed alio of bringing home fomething
fit. to eat. *
Nov. 23. My other work having flood Hill, becaufe
of my making thefe tools, when they were flnilhed* I
went on, and working every day as my llrength and
time allowed, I Ipent eighteen days entirely in widening
and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods
commodiouily.
Note. —During all this time I worked to make this
room or cave fpacious enough to accommodate me as a
warehoufe or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-roorn, and
a cellar; as for a lodging, 1 kept to the tent, except
that iometimes, in the wet feafon of the year, it rained
fo hard, that I could not keep myfelf dry; which caufed
ine afterwards to cover all my place within my pale
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning agai?iil
the rock, and load them with flags, and large leaves of
trees, like thatch.
Dec. io» I began now to think my cave or vault
iinimed, when on a fudden (it feems I had made it tdo
large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the top
and one fide, fo much, that in Ihoit, it frightened me,
and not without reafon to; for if I had been under it,
I had never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this difafter
I had a great deal of work to do over again; for 1 had
the loofe earth to carry out, and, which was of more im-
portance, I had the cieling to prop up, fo that I might
be fure no more would come down.
Dec. 11. This day! went to work with it according-
ly, and got two (hoars, or polls, pitched upright to tne
top, with two pieces of board acrofs over each poll; this
I fmilhed the next day; and fetting up more polls with
boards, in a about a week more I had the roof iccured,
and the polls Handing in rows, ferved me for partitions
to part off the houfe.
 
Dec. 17. From thu day to the 20th, I placed flielves,
and knocked up nails in the polls, to hang every thing
on that could be hung up—and now I begun to be m
feme order within do®rs.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to fwnilh my houfe, and fet up fome pieces
of board like adreffer, to order my victuals upon; but
board began to be very fcarce with me—I alfo made me
another table.
Dec. 24, Much rain all night and all day; no bir-
ring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 20. No rain, and the earth much cooler than be-
fore, and pleafanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat and lamed another, fo
that I catched, and led it home in a tiring; when I
had it home, I bound and fplintered up its leg which
was broke. N. B. I took fuch care of it that it lived,
and the leg grew well and as ftrong as ever; but by
11 urling it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
green at my door, and would not go away. This was
the ririt time that I entertained a thought of breeding
up fome tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and (hot was all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; fo that
there was no ftirring abroad, except in the evening, for
food. This time I fpent in putting all my things in
order within doors*
January 1. Very hot Mill, but I went abroad early and
late, with my gun, and lay ftill in the middle of the
day. This evening, going further into the valleys.,
which lay towards the center of the ifland, I found there
was plenty of goats, tho' exceedingly my, and hard to
come at; however, I refolved to try if I could not bring
my dog to hunt them down.
Jan, 2. Accordingly the next day I went out with
my dog, and fet him at the goats; but I was miftaken,
for they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his
danger too well, for he would not go near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence, or wall, which, being fUU
jealous of my being attacked by fomebody, X refolved to
make very thick mi ftrong.
Vou I* D N.B. This
 
 
 
N.B. This wall being defcribed before, I purpofely
omit what was faid in the Journal; it is fufRcient
to obferve, that, I was no lefs time than from the
3d of January to the 14th of April, working, fi-
niming, and perfecting this wall, tho* it was no
more than about 24 yards in length, being an half
circle, from one place in the rock to another place
about eight yards from it, the door of the cave be-
ing in the center behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hinder-
ing me many days, nay, fometimcs weeks together; but
I thought I ihould never be perfectly fecure till this wall
"was finifhed; and it is Jcarcely credible what inexpreflible
labour every thing was done with, efpecially the bring-
ing piles out of the wood, and driving them into the
ground, for I made them much bigger than I needed to
have done.
When this wall was fmiflied, and the outfrde double-
fenced with a turf-wall raifed up dole to it, I perfuaded
myfelf, that if any people were to come on more there,
they would not perceive any thing like an habitation:
and it is very well I did fo, as may be obferved here-
after, upon a very remarkable occafton.
During thj^ time, 1 made rounds in the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and
made frequent difcoveries in thefe walks of fomething
or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind
of wild pigeons, which build not as vvcod-pigeons, in a
tree, but rather as houfe-pigeons, in the holes of the
rocks; and taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did io; but when they grew
older, they all flew away, which perhaps was at fir ft for
want of feeding them, for 1 had nothing to give them;
however, I frequently found their nelts, and got their
young ones, which was very good meat.
And now, in the managing my houfhold affairs, I
found myfelf wanting in many things, which I thought
at iirft it was impoilible for me to make, as indeed as to
fome of them it was: For inftance, 1 could never make
a cafk to be hooped; J had a fmall ruadlet or two, as I
obferved before, but I could never arrive to the capacity
of making one by them, tho' I ipent many weeks about
 
it ; I could neither put in the heads, nor join the Haves
io true to one another as to make them hold water; fo
2 gave that alio over.
In the next place, I was at agreatlofs for candles;
fo that as foon as it was dark, which was generally by
feven o'dock, 1 was obliged to go to bed.—I remem*
hcred the lump of bees-wax with which 1 made candles
in my African adventure; but I had none of that now;
the only remedy 1 had was, that when I had killed a
goat, I laved the tallow, and with a little difh made
of clay, which I baked in the fun, to which I added a
wick of fome oakum, I made me a lamp; and this
gave me light, tho' not a clear Heady light like a can-
dle. In the middle of all my labours it happened, that
rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, a*
1 hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feed-
ing of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I
fappofe, when the ihip came from Lifbon; what little
remainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured
by the rats, and I faw nothing in the bag but hulks
and dull; and being willing to have the bag for fome
v her ufe (f think it was to put powder in, when I di-
vided it lor ft .r of the lightning, or fome fuch ufe) I
fhook the hulks of corn out of it on one fide of my for-
tific-it»on, un.ltr the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, jufl now men-
tioned, that I threw this fluff away, taking no notice of
any thing, and not fo much as remembering that 1 had
thrc-vvn any thing there; when about a month after, or
thereabouts,, I law fome kw ftaiks of fome thing green
ihooting upon the ground, which I fancied might be
fome plant J had nest fcen; but I was furprifed, and per-
redly ailonimed, when after a little longer time, I faw
about ten or twelve cars come out, which were perfect
green barley, of the fame kind as our European, nay, as
our b.nglifh barley.
It is impt uhble to exprefs the aflonifhment and con-
fuiioa of my thoughts on this occafion; 1 had hitherto
acted upon no religious foundation at all; indeed I
hud very tt w notions of religion in my head, nor
had cttitained any fenie or any thing that had befallen
me, other wile than as a chance, or, as we lightly fay,
D 2 what
 
 
75 ADVENTURES OF
what pleafes Cod, without fe much as enquiring inte
the end of Providence in thefe things, or his order in
governing, events in the world. But after I faw barley
grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper
for corn, and especially as I knew not how it came there,
ic ftartled me ftrangely, and I began to fuggeft, that
God had miraculoufly caufed this grain to grow without
any help of feed fown, and that it was fo directed, pure-
ly for my fuftenance in that wild miferable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out
of my eyes, and I began to blefs myfelf, that inch a
prodigy of nature mould happen upon my account; and
this was the more ftrange to me, becaufe I faw near it
frill, all along by the fide of the rock, fome other ftrag-
gling fralks, which proved to be ftalks of rice, and which
I knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when I
was alhore there.
1 not only thought thefe the pure productions of Pro-
vidence for my fupport; but not doubting but that there
was more in the place, I went all over that part of the
illand where I had been before, peeping into every cor*
ner, and under every rock, to fee for more of it, but I
could not find any; at laft it occurred to my thoughts,
that I had fhaken the bag of chickens meat out in that
place, and the wonder began toceafe; and I mult con-
iefs, my religious thankfulnefs to God's providence be-
gan to abate, upon difcovering that all this was nothing
but what was common; though I ought to have been as
thankful for fo ftrange and unforefeen a Providence, as
if it had been miraculous; for it was really the work of
Providence, as to me, that mould order or appoint, that
ten or twelve grains of corn fhould remain unfpoiled,
when the rats had deftroyed all the reft, as if it had been
dropped from heaven: as alfo, that 1 Ihould throw it out
into that particular place, where, it being in the made
of an high rock, fprang up immediately: whereas, if I
had thrown it any where elfe at that time, it had been
burnt up and deftroyed.
I carefully faved the ears of this corn, you may be
fure, in their feafon, which was about the end of J une;
and laying up every grain, I refolved to fow them all
again, hoping in time to have fome quantity, fufficient
to
 
t® fupply me with bread; but it was noyill the fourth
year that I would allow myfelf the lea It grain of this corn
to eat, and even then but fparingly, as I ihall fay after-
wards in its order, for I loft all 1 fowed the fi*ft fcafon,
by not obferving the proper time; for I fowed it juft be-
fore the dry feafon, fo that it never came up at ail, at
leali: not as it would have done—oi which in its place.
Befides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty ftalks of rice which I preferved with the fame care,
and whofe life was of the fame kind, or to the fanv*
purpoie, viz. to make me bread, or rather food;
ibr 1 found ways to cpok it up without baking, though
I did that alio after fome time* But to return to my jour-
nal .
I worked avecflive hard thefe three or four months, to
get my wail done; and the 14th of April I doled it up,
contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over a wall
by a ladder, that there might be no %n, on the out-
fide, of my habitation.
April 16. I finilhed the laddei; fo I went up with it
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it
down on the inftde: This was a complete inclofure to
me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unlefs it could firft mount my
wall.
The very next day after this wall was finifhed, T had
almoft had all my labour overthrown at once, and my-
felf killed: the cafe was thus: As I was bufy in the
infide of it, behind my tent, juft in the entrance into
my cave, I was terribly frightened with a moll dreadful
furprifing thing indeed: for all on a fudden 1 found the
earth came tumbling down from the roof of my cave,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two
of the pofts I had fet up in the cave cracked in a fright-
ful manner, 1 was heartily feared, but thought nothing
of what really was the caufe; only thinking that the
top of my cave was falling in, as Some of it had done
before, and for fear I mould be buried in it, I ran for-
wards to my ladder, and not thinking myfelf lafe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the
hill, which I expecled might roll down upon me. I was
no fooner ftept down upon the firm ground, but I plain -
£3 iy
 
ly faw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I
itjod on Ihook three times, at about eight minutes dif-
tance, with three fucb mocks as would have overturned
the itrongeit buildings that could be fuppofed to have
ftood upon the earth; and a great piece of the top cf
the rock, which flood at about half a mile /ram me, next
the fea, fell down with fuch a terrible noife as I never
heard in all my life, I perceived alfo the very fea was
put into a violent motion by it; and I believe the mocks
were Wronger under the water than on the ifland.
I was fo amazed with the thing itfelf, having never
felt the like, or diicourfed with any one that had, that I
was like one dead or ftupified; and the motion of the
earth made my ftomach fick, like one that is toiled at
fea; but the noife of the falling of the rock awaked me,
as it were, and roufing me from the ftupified condition
I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my hmil.
hold goods, and burying all at once; and this funk my
very ibul within me a fecondtime.
After the third mock was over, and I felt no more for
fome time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not
heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of be-
i&g buried alive; but ft ill fat on the ground, greatly
call down, and difconiolate, not knowing what to do:
all this while I had not the leaft ferions religious t hought,
nothing but the common, Lord, have mercy upon me;
and when it was over that went away too.
While I fat thus, I found the air over-caft, and it grew
cloudy, as if it would rain; and in lefs than half an
hour it blew a moft dreadful hurricane of wind.—The
fea, all on a fudden, was covered with foam and froth,
the more was covered with the breach of the water, the
trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible dorm it
was; and this held about three hours, and then began to
abate ; and then in two hours more it was calm, and be-
gan to rain very hard.
All this while I fat upon the ground very much terri-
fied and dejected, when on a fudden it came into my
thoughts that thefe winds and rain being the confequence
of the earthquake, the earthquake itfelf was fpent and
over, and I might venture into my cave again: with
 this
 
 
 
this thought my fpirits began to revive, and the rain
helping a!fo to perfuade me, I went in, and fat me down
in 'my tent; hut the rain was fo violent, that my tent
was ready to he beaten down with it, and I was forced
to go into my cave, tho' very much afraid and uneafy,
for fear it mould fa!! on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a hole thro' my new fortification, like a fmk, to let
the water go out, which would elfe have drowned rtfy
cave. After I had been in my cave Ionic time, and
found ili 11 no more mock of the earthquake follow, I
began to be more compofed; and now, to compofe my
fpirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little ftore, and took a fmall fup of rum, which
however I did then, and always very fparingly, knowing
1 could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining a*I that night, and great part of
tie next day, fo that I could not ftir abroad; but my
mind being more compofed, 1 began to think of what I
had be ft to do; concluding, that if the illand was fub-
je& to thele earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I muft think of building me fome
little hut in an open place, which I might furround with
a wall, as I had d me here, and fo make myfelf fecure
from wild beads or men; but concluded, if I flaid
where I was, I ihouid certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive.
With thefe thoughts I refolved to move my tent
from the place where it iiood, which was jult under the
hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it mould
be (haken again, would certainly fail upon my tent;
and I fpent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th
of April, in contriving where and how to remove my
habitation.
The fear of being fwallowed up alive affected me fa,
that I never flept in quiet; and yet the apprehenfions of
lying abroad, without any fence, were almoft equal to
it.—-But ftill, when I looked about, and faw how every
thing was put in order, how perfectly concealed I
was, and how fafe from danger, it made me loth to re-
move.
 
In
 
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would re-
quire a vail deal of time for me to do this, and that I
inujt be contented to run the venture where I was, till I
had formed a camp for myfelf, and had fecured it fo as to
remove to it: fo with this refolution I com poled myfelf
for a time, and refolved that I would go to work with all
fpeed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a
circle, as before, and fet my tent up in it when it was
imtlhcd; but that I would venture to Hay where I was till
it was Sr.iH.cd and f;t to remove to.—This was the 2> fh
April 22. The next morning I began to confider of
means to put this refolVe in execution; but J was at a
great lofs about my tool?; I had three large axes, and
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for
traliic with the indians) but with much chopping and
cutti ng knotty hard wood, they were ail full of notches,
and dull, and tho' i had a grind Hone, I could not turn it
and grind ray tools too; this coil me as much thought
as a llatefraan would have bellowed on a grand point
of politics, or a judge upon the life and death Of a cri-
minal.-—At length i contrived awheel, with a firing to
turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands
at liberty .-—Note, 1 had not feen any fuch thing in En-
gland, or at Icaft not to take notice how it was done;
tho* iince I lave obferved it was very common there;
befides that, mv grincUtone was very large and heavy.
This machine coil me a full week's work to,bring it to
perf:£iion.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole days I took up m
grinding my tools; my machine for turning my grind-
itone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, T now took a furvcy of it, and reduced
myfelf to one biicuit-cake a day, which made my heart
very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the fea~fide,
the tide being low, I faw fomething lie on the more
bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cafe; when I
came to it, I found a fmall barrel, and two or three
pieces of the wreck of the fhip, which were driven on
fhore by the late hurricane; and looking towards th£
wreck itfelf, X thought it feemed to lie higher out of the
water
 
 
 
 
 
water than it ufed to do; I examined the barrel which
was driven on fliore, and Toon found it to be a barrel of
gunpowder, but it had taken water, and the powder was
caked as hard as a ilonc. However, 1 rolled it farther on
the ihore for the prefent, and went on, upon the fands,
as near as I could to the wreck of the ftup, to look for
more.
When I came down to the fiiip, I found it llrangcly
removed; the fore-caitte, which lay before buried in
fand, was heaved up at lead fix feet; and the item, which
was broken to pieces, and parted from the reil by the
force of the fea, foon after 1 had left rummaging of her,
was toffed as it were up, and call on one fide; and t]\c.
fand was thrown ib high on that fide next the item, that
whereas there was a great place of water before, fo that
I could not come within a quarter of mile of the wieck
without fvvimming, I could now walk quite up to her
when the tide was out. I was furprifed at this at fivii,
but loon concluded it muit be done by the earthquake;
and as by this violence the ihip was more broke open
than formerly, fo many things cimc daily on Ihore which
the fea had loofened, and which the winds and water rol-
led by degrees to land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the defign of
removing my habitation; and I buiieel my feif mightily,
that day efpecially, in feai ciiing whether I couia make,
any way into the fhip; but I found nothing was to be ex-*
pe&ed of the kind, for that all the in fide of the fhip was.
choaked up with fand. However, as 1 had learnt not to
defpair of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to
pieces that 1 could of the fhip, concluding that everv
thing t could get from her would be of fome ufe or other
to me.
May 3. I began with my faw, and cut a piece of a
beam thro* which I thought held fome of the upper part, *
or quarter deck, together; and when I had cut it thro',
I cleared away the land, us well as 1 coui.i, from the
fide which lay highehS But the tide coming ii\ { vvaa
obliged to give it over for that time.
May 4. 1 went a liilung, but caught but one fifn that
I durit eat of, till ( was weary of my (port, when jult
going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had
D S made .
 
made me a long line of fome rope yarn, but I had no
hooks, yet I frequently caught fifh enough, as much, as
I cared to eat j all which 1 dried in the fun, and eat
them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam afun-
der, and brought three great fir planks off from the
decks, which I tied together, and made fwim on more
when the tide of flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got feveral iron bolts
out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very
hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts
of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent
not to work; but found the weight of the wreck had
broken itfelf down, the beams being cut, that feveral
pieces of the fhip feemed to lie loofe, and the infide of
the hold lay fo open, that I could fee into it, but almofl
full of water and fand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of
the water or fand. I wrenched open two planks, and
brought them on more alfo with the tide. I left the iron
crow in the wreck for the next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt feveral cafks,
and loofened them with the orow, but could not break
them up; I felt alfo a roll of Englifh lead, and could
fiir it, but it was too heavy to remove.
May 10, 11, 12, 13,14. Went every day to the wreck,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber and boards, or
planks, and 2 or 300 weight of iron.
May ic. I carried two hatchets to try if I could not
cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of
one hatchet and driving it with the other; but as it lay
about a foot and a half in the water, I could not make
any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water;
but I ftaid fo long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to the wreck that day.
May 17. I faw fome pieces ©f the wreck blown on
fho*€ at a gseat diflance, two miles off me, but refolved
to
 
 
to fee what they were, and found a piece of the head,
but too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck, and with much labour 1 loofened fome things fo
much wi::i the crow, that the mil flowing tide feveral
cafks floated our, and two of the feamens cheils. But
the wind blowing from the more, nothing came to land
that day but pieces of timber, and an hogfhead which
had fome BrafiJ pork in it, but the fait water and the
fand had fpoiied it.
1 continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
except the timenecefiary to get food, which I always ap-
pointed, during this part of my employment, to be when
the tide was up, that 1 might be ready when it was eb-
bed out; and by this time had gotten timber and plank,,
and iron-work, enough to have built a good boat, if I
had known how; and I alfo got, at feveral times, and
in feveral pieces, near 100 weight of the meet lead.
June 16. Going down to the fea fide I found a large
tortoife or turtle; this was the fir ft I had feen, which, it
feems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the
place, or fear city; for had I happened to be on ttie other
fide of the iiland, I might have had hundreds of them
every day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid
dear enough for them.
June 17. I fpent in cooking the turtle. I found in
her threefcore eggs; and her fidh was to me, at that time,,
the moft favoury and pie a 1 ant that ever I tailed in my
lite, having had no flcfti but of goats and fowls fmce I
landed in tins horrible place.
June j 8. Rained all the day, and I ftaid within, I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was fome-
what chilly, which I knew was not ufual in that latitude*
June 19. Very iil and Ihivering, as if the weather had
been cold.
June 20. No reft all night; violent pains in my
head, and feverilh.
June 2!. Very ill, frighted almoft to death with the
apprehen&ons ot my fad condition—to be lick, and no
help,—Prayed to God for the firittime fLice the itorm off
Hull; but fcarce knew what I faid or why, my thoughts:
being all confufed.
D 6 Jaae;
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful appreben-
ftons of fickncfs.
June 23. Very bad again; cold and fhivering, and
then a violent head-ach,
June 24 Much better.
June 25, An ague, very violent; the fit held me fever*
hours—cold fit and hot—with faint fweats after it.
June 26. Better—and having no victuals to eat, took
my gun, but found myfelf very weak; however, I killed
a (he goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and
broiled fome of it, and eat; I would fain have Hewed it,
and made fome broth, but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again fo violent, that I lay a bed
all day, and neither eat nor drank. 1 was ready to pe-
xifh with thirit, but fo weak I had no ftrength to ftand
up, or get myfelf a»y water to drink; prayed to God
again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I
was fo ignorant that I knew not what to fay; I only lay
and cried, Lord look upon me; Lord, pity me; Lord,
have mercy upon me.—I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell afleep,
and did not awake till far in the night. When I awaked,
I found myfelf much refremed, but weak, and exceed-
ingly thirily; however, as I had no water in my whole
habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went
to fleep again. In this fecond fleep I had this terrible
dream.
I thought that I was fitting on the ground, on the
outfide of my wall, where I fat when the ftorm blew
after the earthquake; and that I faw a man defcend from
a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light
upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame,
fo that I could but juft bear to look towards him; his
countenance was moft inexpreflibly dreadful, impoffible
for words to defcribe; when he ftepped upon the ground
with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, jufl as it had
done before in the earthquake; and all the air looked,
to my appreheniion, as if it had been filled with flames
cf fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forwards towards me, with a long fpear or wea-
pon in his hand to kill me; and when he came to a
 
 
 
 
 
riling ground, at fome diftance, he fpoke to me, or I
heard a voice fo terrible, that it is impoffible to exprefs
the terror of it; all that I can fay 1 underilood, was
this, Seeing all thefe things have not brought thee to re-
pentance, now thou malt die. At which words, I thought
he lifted up the fpear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one that ftiall ever read this account, will expecl
that I Ihould be able to defcribe the horrors of my foul
at this terrible virion; I mean, that even while it was a
dream, I even dreamed of thofe horrors; nor is it any
more poflible to defcribe the iinpreihon that remained
upon my mind, when 1 awaked, and found it was but a*
dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had re-
ceived by the good initruclion of my father, was then
worn out by an uninterrupted feries, for eight years of
lea-faring wickednefs, and a conilant conversation with
»one but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked and profane
to the kit degree; I do not remember, that I had in all
that time one thought that fo much as tended either to
looking upwards towards God, or inwards towards a re-
flection upon my own ways; but a certain ftupidity of
foul, without defire of good, or confcience of evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the moil
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our com-
mon fatlors can be fuppofed to be, not having the leait
fenfe of the fear of God in dangers, or of thankfulnefs
to God in deliverances.
In relating what is already paft of my ftory, this
will be the more cafily believed, when J mall add, that
through all the variety of miferies that had to this day
befallen me, I never had io much as one thought of its
being the hand of God, or that it was a juft punifhment
for my fins, my rebellious behaviour again ft my father,
or my prcicnt fins, which were great; or io much as a
punifhment for the general courfe of my wicked life.
When I was on the uefpcrate expedition, on the dcfart
fhores of Africa, 1 never had fo much as one thought
of what would become of me, or one wiih to God to
dircct me whither 1 Ihould go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently furrounded me, as well from
voracious creatures, as cruel lavages: But I wasj
merely
 
merely thoughtlefs of God, or a Providence; I afted;
like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by
the chelates of common fenie only, and indeed hardly
that.
When I was delivered and taken up at fea by the Por-
tugal captain, well ufed and dealt juftly and honourably
with, as well as charitably, I had not the leaft thankful-
nei's in my thoughts: When again I was fhipwrecked,
ruined, and in danger of drowning on this iiland, I was
as far from remorfe, or looking on it as a judgment; I
only laid to myfelf often, that I was an unfortunate dog,
and born to be always miferable.
It is true, when I got on more firft here, and found all.
my (hip's crew urowned, and myfelf ipared, 1 was fur-
priied with a kiad of extal'y, and fome transports of
ibul, which, had the grace of God affiited, might have
came up to true thanktulnefs; but it ended where it be-
gan, in a mere common flight of joy; or, as I may fay,
being glad 1 was alive, without the leaft reflection upon
the diftinguifhmg goodnefs of the hand which had pre-
fer vod m j and had iiagied me out to be preferved, when
all the reft were deftroyed ; or an inquiry why providence
had been thus merciful to me ; even juft the fame common
fort of joy which feamen generally have, after thvy have
got tafe aihore from a mipwreck, which they drown all
in the next bowl of punc.i, and forget almo'.t as foon as
it is over, and all the reft of ray liie was like it.
Even when 1 was afterwards, on due conftderation,
made lenfible of my condition, how 1 was caft on this
dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out
©f all hope of relief, or proipect of redemption; as loon
as 1 faw a probability of living, and that I mould not
flarve and peri In for hunger, all the fenfe ot my affliction
wore off, and I began to be very eafy, applied myieil to
the works proper for my pre ier vat ion and fupply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as
a judgment from heaven, or as ttie hand of God againft
me: Theie were thoughts which very leldom entered
imo my head.
The growing up of the corn, a? is hinted in my jour-
nal, had at fir-t iome little influence upon me, and be-
gan to affect me with feriouinefs, as long as I thought,
•it.
 
 
 
It had fomething miraculous in it; but as foon as ever
that part of thought was removed, ail the im predion
which was raifed from it, wore off alio, as 1 have noted
already.
E en the earthquake, tho* nothing could be more ter-
rible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the
inviiible power, which alone directs luch things; yet no
fooner was the firft fright over, but t^e impreflion it had
made went off alfo. I had no more fenfe of God, or his
judgment, much lets of the prefent affliction of my cir-
cumilance* being from his hand, than if 1 had been in
r.he moil profperous condition in life
But now when I began to be fick, and a leifurely view*
of the miseries of death came to place itieif before me;
when my fpirits began to fink under the burthen of a
ftrong diftemper, and nature W3S exhaufted with the
violence of the fever; conlcience, that had flcpt fo
long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myfelf
with my pair life, in which I had fo evidently, by un-
common wickednefs, provoked the jutice of God to lay
me under uncommon ilrokes, and to deal with me in fo
vindictive a manner,
Theie reflections opprcfled me from the fecond or
third day of my diitemper, and in a violence, as well
of the fever, as of the dreadful reproaches of my con-
lcience, extorted fome words from me, like praying to
God, tho' I cannot fay they were either a prayer attend-
ed with Jefires, or with hopes; it was rather the voice
of mere fright and diflrefs; my thoughts were confufed,
the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of
dying in fuch a miferable condition, raifed vapours into
my head with the mere apprehcnfions; and, in thefe
harries of my foul, 1 knew not what my tongue might
cxprets: But it was rather exclamation, fuch "as, Lord t
what a miferable creature am Vi If I mould be lick, I
mall certainly aie for want of help, and what will be-
come of me! Tnen the tears burft out of my eyes, and
1 could fay no more a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came to
my mind, and prefently his prediction, which I mention-
ed in the beginning of this ilory, viz. That it 1 did take
mis foolifh itep, God would not blefs me, and 1 would
hav-e
 
 
 
 
 
 
have lcifure hereafter to reflect upon having negle&ed his
counfcl, when there might be none to afliilme in my re-
covery. Now, laid I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pafs: God's juftice has overtaken me, and I
have none to help or hear me. 1 rejected the voice of
providence, which had mercifully put me in a poiture or
ilation of life wherein I might have been happy and
eafy; bat I would neither fee it myfelf, nor Jearn to
know the blefling of it from my parents; I left them to
mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under
the confequences of it: I refufed their help and afhftance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and would
have made every thing eafy to me -9 and now I have dif-
ficulties to ftruggle with, too great for even nature itfelf
to fupport, and no alliltance, no help, no comfort, no ad-
vice. Then I cried out, Lord, be my help, for I am in
great diilrefs.
This was the fir ft prayer, if I might call it fo, that I
had made for many years. But I return to my journal.
June 28. Having been fomevvhat refrefhed with the
fleep I had taken, and the fit being entirely oft-', I got up;
and though the fright and terror of my dream was very
great, yet I confidered, that the fit of the ague would
return again the next day, and now was my time to
get fomething to refreih and fupport myfelf when I Ihould
be iil; and the firit thing I did, I filled a large fquare
cafe bottle with water, and fet it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguifh
difpolition of the water, I put about a quarter of a
pint of rum into it, and mixed them together; then I
got me a piece of the goat's flem, and broiled it on the
coals, but could eat very little; I walked about, but was
very weak, and withal, very fad and heavy-hearted in
the fenfe of my miferabie condition, dreading the return
of my diitemper the next day; at night I made my
fupper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roafied
in the aihes, and eat, as we call it, in the fhell; and
this was the firit bit of meat I had ever alked God's
bleffing to, even, as 1 could remember, in my whole
life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myfelf fo
weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went
 
 
out without that) fo I went out but a little way, and
fat down upon the ground, looking out upon the fea,
which was juft before me, and very calm and fmooth.
As 1 fat here, fome thoughts, fuch as thefe, occurred
to me.
What is the earth and fea, of which I have feen fo
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and bru-
tal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by fome fecret power, who
formed the earth and fea, the air and Iky; and who is
that?
Then it followed, moft naturally; It is God that has
made it all: well, but then it came on ftrongly; if God
has made all thefe things, he guides and governs them
all, and all things that concern them; for the Being
that could make all things, muft certainly have power
to guide and direct them.
if fb, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, either without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and in a dreadful condition;
and if nothings happens without his appointment, he has
appointed ail this to befal me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of thefe conclusions; and therefore it relied upon me
uii;h the greater force, that it muft needs be, that God
had appointed all this to befal me; that J was brought
to this miferable circumftan#e by his direction, he
having the fole power, not of me only, but of every
thing that happened in the world. Immediately it fol-
lowed.
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to
be thus ufed?
My confeience prefently checked me in that inquiry,
a» if I had blafphemed; and methought it fpoke to me
like a voice j Wretch! doll thou afk what thou haft done?
took back upon a dreadful mif-fpent life, and afk thy-
felf, what thou haft not done? Afk, why is it that thou
wen not Jong ago deftroyed? Why wert thou not drown-
ed in Yarmouth Roads? Killed in the fight when the
ihijp was taken by" the Sallee man of war r devoured
by
 
by the wild beads of the coaft of Africa? Or, drowned
here, when all the crew perilhed but thyfelf? Doll thou
afk, What have I done!
I was llruck dumb with thefe reflexions as one alio-
nifhed, and had not a word to lay, no, not to anfsver to
myfelf; but rofe up pen five and fad, walked back to my
retreat, a:id went up over my wall, as if I had been go-
ing to bed; but my thoughts were fadly difturbed, and
I had no inclination to deep; fo I fat down in my chair,
and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark* Now, as
the apprehenfions of the return of my diftemper terrified
me very much, it occured to n\y thought, that the. Bra-
zilians take no phyfic but their tobacco, lor a 1 moll all
diftenipers ; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one
of the chefts, which was quite cured, and fome alfo that
was green, and not quite cured.
I went, direeled by heaven, no doubt 1 for in this
cheft I found a cure both for foul and body; I opened
the chert, and round what I looked for, viz, the to-
bacco; and as the few books 1 had faved lay there too,
I took out one of the bibles which J mentioned before,
and which, to this time, 1 had not found leifure, or fo
much as inclination, to look into; I fay t took it out,
and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.
What ule to make of the tobacco T knew not, as to
my diftemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but
I tried feveral experiments with it, as if I was refolved
it mould hit one way or other. I firft took a piece of a
leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed at firft
almoft ftupifted my brain, the tobacco being green and
itrong, and that I had not been much ufed to it 5 th§n I
took fome, and fteeped it an hour or two in rum, and re-
folved to take a dofe of it when I lay down; and laftly,
I burnt fome upon a pan of coals, and held my nofe clofe
over the fmoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as weH
for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held aimoft to fuf-
location.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible,
and began to read; but my head was too much difturb-
ed with the tobacco to bear reading, at leaft at that
time, only having opened the book cafually, the fir$
words
 
 
 
words that occured to me were thefe, Call on me in the
day ofiroulle, andI <will deliver, and thou JhaHglorify me.
The words were very apt to my cafe, and made force
impreffion upon my thoughts at the time of reading
them, though not fo much'as they did afterwards; for
as for feeing delivered, the word had no found, as I may
fay, to me; the thing was fo remote, fo impoffible in
my apprehenfion of things, that I began to fay, as the
children of Ifrael did, when they were promifed flefh to
eat, Can Godfpread a tabh in the wilderntfs? So I began
to fay, can God himfeif deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap-
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts:
but however, the words made a very great ixn predion
upon me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the tobacco had, as I faid, dozed my head
h much, that I inclined to ileep; fo I left my lamp
burning in the cave, left I Ihould want any thing in the
nif>ht, and went to bed j but before I lay down, I did
what 1 never had done in all my life; I Lneeled down
and prayed to God to fulfil the prcmife to me, that if I
called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
n e: after my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had ileeped the tobacco,
which was fo ftrong and rank of'he tobacco, that in-
deed I could fcarce get it down. Immediately upon this
I went to bed, and I found prefently it flew up into my
head violently; but I fell into a found fleep, and waked
no more, till by the fun it muft neceffarily be near three
o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay , to this hour
I am partly of the opinion, that 1 fiept all the next day
and night, and till almoft three the day after; for
otherwife I knew not how I fhould lofe a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared fome
years after 1 had done; for if I had loft it by croffing
aud re-croffing the line, I mould have loft more than a
day; but in my account, it was loft, and I never knew
which way.
Be that however one way or other, when I awaked,
I found myfelf exceedingly refrefhed, and my fpirits
lively and chearful; when I got up, I was ftronger than
I was the day before, and my ftomaeh better; for 1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was hungry; and, in fhort, I had no fit the rext day*
but continued much altered for the better: this was the
29th.
The 30th was my well day of courfe, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far: I killed a fea fowl or two, fomething like a brand
goofe, and brought them home, but was not very for-
ward to eat them: fo I eat lb me more of the turtle's
eggs, which were very good: this evening I renewed
the medicine which J had fuppoled did me good the
day before, viz. the tobacco ileeped in rum; only I
did not take fo much as before, nor did I chew any of
the leaf, or hold my head over the fmoke; however, I
was not fo well the next day, which was.the lit of JuKs
as I hoped I mould have been; for I had a little fpice of
the cold fit, but it was not much-.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myfelf with it at iirft, and doubled the quan-
tity which 1 drank.
July 3d. I miffed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full itrength for fome weeks after.
While I was thus gathering ftrength, my thoughts ran
exceedingly upon this fcripture, I will deliver thee; and
the impofiibility of my deliverance lay much upon my
mind, in bar of my ever expelling it: but as I was dif-
couraging myfelf with fuch thoughts, it occurred to my
mind, that I pored fo much upon my deliverance from
the main affliction, that I difregarded the deliverance I
had received; and I was, as it were, made to aft: my-
felf fuch queltions as thefe; viz. have I not been deli-
vered, and wonderfully too, from ficknefs? from the
fnoitdiftreffed condition that could be, and that was fo
frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it ? had
I done my part? God had delivered me: but 1 had not
glorified him: that is to fay, I had not owned and been
thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could I ex-
peel greater deliverance?
This touched my heart very much, and immediately
I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my
recovery from my ficknefs.
Juty 4» in the morning I took the Bible; and, be-
ginning at the New Terlament, I began ferioufly to read
it,
it, and impofcd upon myfelf to read a while every
morning and every night, not tying myfelf to the num-
ber of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should en-
gage me: it was not Jong after I fet ferioufly to this
work, but I found my heart more deeply and fincerely
affected with the wickednefs of my paft life; the im-
preflion of my dream revived, and the words, All thefe
things ha<ve not brought thee to repentance, ran ferioufly in
my thoughts; 1 was earneftly begging of God to give
me repentance, when it happened providentially the
very day, that*, reading the fcripture, I came to thefe
words. He is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour, to grve re-
fentance, and to give remijfion: 1 threw down the book,
and with my heart as well as my hand lifted up to hea-
ven, in a kind of extacy of joy, I cried out aloud, jefus,
thou Son of David; Jefus! thou exalted Prince and
Saviour! give me repentance.
This was the firft time that I could fay in the true
fenfe of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now
1 prayed with a fenfe of my condition, and with a tiue,
icripture view of hope, founded on the encouragement
of the word of God; and from this time, 1 may fay, I
began to have hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to conftrue the words mentioned above,
Call on me, and I nvill deliver thee, in a different fenfe
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no no-
tion of any thing being called deliverance, but my be-
ing delivered from the captivity I was in; for though I
was indeed at large in the place, yet the ifland was cer-
tainly a prifon to me, and that in the worft fenfe in the
world; but now I learned to take it in another fenfe.
Now I looked back upon my paft life with fuch horror,
and my fins appeared fo dreadful, that my foul fought
nothing of God, but deliverance from the load of guilt
that bore down all my comfort. As for my foiitary life,
it was nothing; I did not fo much as pray to be deli-
vered from it, or think of it; it was all of no confidera-
tion in comparifon of this; and I added this part here,
to hint to whoever mail read it, than whenever they
come to a true fenfe of things, they will find deliverance
from fin a much greater bleffing, than deliverance from
affti&iom

ADVENTURES OF
But leaving this part I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not lefs re-
ferable as to my way of living, yet much eafier to my
mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a conftant
reading the fcripture, and praying to God, to things of
a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within,
which till now I knew nothing of: alfo as my health and
ftrength returned, I beftirred mylelf to furnim myfelf
with every thing that I wanted, and make my way of
living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand a little
and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his
ftrength after a fit of ficknefs ; for it is hardly tobe ima-
gined, how low I was, and to what weaknels I was re-
duced. The application which I made ufe of, was per-
fectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague be-
fore ; neither can I recommend it to any one to practife
by this experiment; and though it did carry off the fit,
yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had fre-
quent convulfions in my nerves and limbs for fome time.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy feafon was the moil pernicious thing
to my health that could be. efpecialiy in thofe rains
which came attended with florins and hurricanes of
wind; for r.s the rain which came in a dry feafon was
always moft accompanied with fuch ftorms, fo I found
th's rain was much more dangerous than the rain which
fell in Septembci: and October.
I had been now in this unhappy ifland above ten
months; all poflihility of deliverance from this condi-
tion feemed to be entirely taken from me, and I firmly
believed, that no human fhape had ever fet foot upon
that place. Having now fecured my habitation, as I
thought, fully to my mind, I had a great defire to
make a more perfect dileovery of the ifland, and to fee
what other productions I might find, which yet I knew
nothing of.
It was the 15 th of July that I began to take a mors
particular furvey of the ifland itfeif; 1 went up toe
creek
 
v.txk firft, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
ihore. I found, alter I Came about two miles up, that
tlx tide did nut flow any higher, and that it was no more
than a little brook of running water, and very frefh and
good *, but this being the dry ieaion, there was hardly
any water in iome parts of it, at leaft not enough to run
into any ftream, io as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleafant
favannas or meadows, plain, imooth, and covered with
grafs; and on the riling parts of them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be fup-
polcd, never overflowed, 1 found a great deal of to-
bacco, green, and growing to a great and very ftrong
lialk: there were divers other plants which I had no
notion of, or undeiHanding about; and might per-
haps have virtues of their own, which I couki not find
out.
J fearched for the cafTava root, which the indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I faw large plants of aloes, but did not
then undsriiand them; 1 law feveral fugar canes, but
wad, and, for uant of cultivation, imperfect, I con-
tented mvfeif with theie difcovcries for this time, and
came back, muling with myfeif what courfe 1 might
take to know the virtue and goodnefs of any of the
fruits or plants which I mould difcover, but could
bring it to no conciufion; for, in fhort, 1 had made fo
little oblervation while I was in the Brafds, that I
knew little of the plants of the field, at leaft very
little that might ferve me to any purpofe, now in my
difbefs.
The next day, the i6th, ] went up the fame way
again; and, afar going iomething farmer than I had
done the day before, I round the brook and the fa van-
na'i began to ceale, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different fruits,
and paiticularly I found melons upon the ground in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines nad fpread indeed over the trees, and the duf-
fers of grapes were jufl now in their prime, very
ripe and rich. This was a furprifing difcovery, and I
was exceeding glad of them, but I was warned by
my
 
 
my experience.to eat fparlngly of them, remembering,
that when I was afhore in Barbary, the eating of grapes
killed feverai of our Engliihmcn who were flares there,
by* throwing them into .fluxes and fevers : but I found an
excellent ufe for thefe grapes, and that was to cure or
dry them in the fun, and keep them as dryed grapes or
raifins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed
they were, as wholefomc, and as agreeable to eat, when,
no grapes might be had.
- 1 fpent all that evening there, and went not back to
my habitation, which by the way was the hxil night, as
I might fay, I had lain from home. In the night 1 took
my iir:r contrivance, and got up into a tree, where If*
irept \.- 'i, anJ the ncv- morning ^rocetdrd upoi.- m/ dii*
-over . r'-aver;n-» nen? r'bur n>;-.as T might i;;>e by
the length of the valley, keeping ilill due north, with a
ridge of hills on the fouth and north lide of me.
At «T»e end oi this in.-'rch I. came to an opening, where
the country leerned to ueicend to the weft; and a little
living of freih water, which ilfued out; of the lide of
the hii. by me, urn the oiher wa\, that l , due c«*:.; and
the country appeared fo frelh, io green, fo flourishing, •
every t!i;n^ being in a conilant verdure, or floiniih of
iprin^,: u -;-;ed a pj.r.-ied g.'.-'^n.
I d--- -.-niied a little rm the fidr; of that ..Vliciou-* :dley,
farveying it with a lecret kind of pleafurc (though
mixed with other arnicang thoughts) to think that this*
was ah my ov u, that i was k*ng and iord of this
country indefcafibly, ami had a right of pofleflion ; and
if I could convey it, 1 might have ii in inheritance, as
*;ompic:eiy as auy lord of a in. ur in i:::gland. i law
f.tre nhmidanci" of coco '-trees, <ut?nge a:? .1 ler^--»: and
citron-trees; but all wild, and few bearing any fruit j
at kail, not then: however, the green limes that I ga*
thered, were ik . only pleaiant eat, f:-,:t very v/hoie-
iome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,
winch made it very wholeiome, and very cool and re-
freih i nt,.
I found now 1 had bufinefs enough, to gather and carry
home; and refolved to lay up a itore, as well of grape 1
as lime a and lemons, to turniilunyielf tvj ihe wei Ualbn,
which I knew was approaching.
In
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a leffer heap in another place, and a
great parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and
taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward,
and refolded to come again, and bring a bag ©r fack, or
what 1 could make, to carry the re It home.
Accordingly, having fpent three days in this journey,
I came home (fo 1 mult now call my tent, and my
cave ;) but before I got thither, the grapes were fpoiled;
the richnefs of the fruit, and the weight of the juice,
having broken them, and hruifed them, they were good
for little or nothing; as to the limes, they were good,
but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two filial 1 bags to bring home my harveit: But
I was furprifed, when coming to my heap of grapes,
which were fo rich and fine when I gathered them, I
found them all fpread abroad, trod to pieces, and drag-
ged about, fome here, fome there, and abundance eaten
and devoured: By this I concluded there were fome
wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were 1 knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a fack, but that
one way they would be deftroyed, and the other way they
would be crulhed with their own weight, I took another
courfe; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the fun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well Hand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleafure the fruitfulnefs of that valley, and
the pleafantnefs of the fituation, thefecurity from ftorms
on that fide of the water, and the wood \ and con-
cluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode,
which was by far the worft part of the country. Upon
the whole, I began to confider of removing my habita-
tiottjfaid to look out for a place equally fafe as where
I now was iituate, if poffible, in that pleaiant fruitful
part of the ifland.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex.
seeding fond of it for fome time, the pleafantnefs of the
Vol, I. E place
 
 
 
place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view
of it, and to con fid er that I was now by the fea fide,
where it was at lealt pofiibie, that fomething might hap-
pen to my advantage, and that the lame ill tare that
brought me hither, might bring feme other unhappy
wretches to tiie lame place; and though it was fcarce
probable, that any fuch thing mould ever happen, yet
to indole mylelf among the hills and woods, in the cen-
tre of the ifland, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
render fuch an affair not only improbable, but impoffible;
and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove,
However, 1 was foenamoured with this place, that I
{pent much of my time there for the whole remaining
part of the month of July; and though, upon fecond
thoughts I refolved as above, not to remove; yet 1 built
me a little kind of a bower, and furrounded it at a dif-
tance with aftrong fence, being a double hedge, as high
as I could reach, well flaked and filled between with
brulhwood; and here I lay very fecure, lometimes two or
three nights together, always going over it with a lad-
der, a» before , io that I fancied now I had my country-
houfe, and my ft a coafl-houfe: and this work took me
up to the beginning of Augufl.
I had but newly finifhed my fence, and began to enjoy
my labour, but the rains came on, and made me flick
clofe to my firll habitation; for though I had made me a
tent like the other, with a piece of a fa.il> and fpead it
very well, yet i had not the Ihelter of an hill to keep me
from ftorms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of Augufl, as I fatd, I had iirviih-
cd my bower, and began to enjoy rnyieif. The third erf
Auguit I found the grapes i had hung up were perfectly
dried, and indeed were excellent good raifins of the
fun; lb I began to take them down from the trees, and
it was very happy that I did fo, for the rains which fol-
lowed would have fpoiied th'm, and I had loft the beft
part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred
large bunches of them No fuoij t had I taken them
all down, and carried moll of them home to my cave,
but it began to rain; and from thence, which was
the fourteenth of Auguil, it rained more or lefs every
day
<Uv, till the midd e of O&ober; and fomeumes fo vio-
lently, that 1 could not ftir out of my cave for leveral
dip.
in this feafon I was much furprifed with the increafe
of my family: 1 had been concerned for the bis 01 one
of my cats, who ran away from me, r, as I nought,
had been dead; and 1 heard no more lale or tudug* of
her, till to my nilommment ihe came home about the
end of Auguft, with three kittens. This was tne more
it range to me, becaufe tho* 1 had killed a wiid cat, as )
called it, wkh my gun, yet I thought it was a qui e dit-
fercnt kind from our European cats; yet the voting ca s
were the fame kind of heule breed like the old u.ie , d id
both my cats being Icmales, I thought it very tfr<tngj:
But from thefe three cats, I afterwards came to be la
pefiered with cats, that I was forced to kill them .ike
vermin, or wild hearts, and to drive them from my nouio
as much as porTihie.
Frrm the fourteenth of Auguft to the twenty-fix th,
ineciTant rain, fo that I could not lUr, and was now
very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement I
began to be ftreightened for food, but venturing out
twice, 1 one day killed a goat; and the laft day, which
was tie twemy-iixth, found a very large tortciie, which
was a trent tc me, and my food was regulated thus: I
1 a: a hunch of raifins for my breakfali, a piece of the
g<;atv tic Hi, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled
(for to my great misfortune I had no veflel to boil or iiev
an;, thing,) and two or three of the turtle's eggs for fupper.
During ihis coniinement In my cover by the ram, I
worked da-'iy two or three hours at enlarging my cave;
mid, fry degrees worked it on towards one fide, till I
a:ne t.< the outride of the hill, and made a door or way
* "it., which came beyond my fence or wall; and fo I
came in and out this way: but I was not perfectly eafy
at lying fo open ; for as I had managed my teif before, I
was in a perfect inclofure, whereas now I thought I lay
c.polcd; and yet 1 could not perceive, that there was
?ny living thing to fear, the biggell creature that I had
y i ken open the. iiland, being a goat.
.September the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhap-
fy anniverinry 0* my landing: I call up the notches oil
£ 2 my
 
my poft,and found I had been on more three hundred
and fixty-five days. I kept this day as a foJernn fail,
Tetting it apart to a religious exercife, proftrating myklf
to the ground with the moil ferious humiliation, eon fell-
ing myielf to God, acknowledging his righteous judg-
ment upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me,
through Jefus Chrifl; and having not tailed the leaft re-
frefliment for twelve hours, even till the going down of
the fun, I then eat a bifcuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes,
and went to bed, finiftiing the day as I began it.
F had all this time obferved no fabbath-day; for as at
fir ft I had no fenfe of religion upon my mind, I had after
fome time omitted todiihnguilh the weeks, by making a
longer notch than ordinary for the fabbath-day, and fo
did not really know what any of the days were; but
now having call up the days as above, I found I had
been there a year; fo I divided it into weeks, and let
apart every feventh day for a fabbath; though I found
at the end of my account, I had loll a day or two of my
reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and fo I
contented myfelf to uie it more fparingly, and to write
down only the mod remarkable events of my life, with-
out continuing a daily memorandum of other things.
The rainy feafon, and the dry fealon, began now to
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them foas
to provide for them accordingly. But 1 bought all my ex*
perience before 1 had it; and this 1 am going to relate,
was one of the moil difcouraging experiments that T made
at all. I have mentioned, that I had faved the few ears of
barley and rice which I had fo furprifingly found fpring
up, as I thought of themfelves, and believe there were
about thirty ftalks of rice , and about twenty of barky \
and now I thought it a proper time to fow it after the
rains,the fun being in its fouthern pofitibn going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I
could, with my wooden fpade, and dividing it into two
parts, I fowed my grain; but as I was fowing, it cafually
occurred to my thoughts, that I would not fow it* all at
firft, becaufc I did not know when was the proper time
for it; fo I fowed about two thirds of the feeds, leaving
about an handful of each*
 
It was a great comfort to me afterwards, that I did fa,
for not one grain of that I fowed this time came to any
thing; for the dry months following, the earth having
had no rain after the feed was fown, it had no moillure
to afiift its growth, and never came up at all, till the
wet feafon had come again, and then it grew as if it had
been newly fown.
Finding my fir 11 feed did not grow, which I cafily
imagined was by the drought, I iought for a moifter
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug up
a piece of ground near my new bovver, and fowed the reft
ot my feed in February, a little before the vernal equi-
nox; and this, having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, (prung up very pleafantly, and yielded
a very good crop; but having part of the feed left only,
and not daring to fow all that I had yet, I had but a
fmall quantity at la£i, my whole crop not amounting to
idjove half a peck of each kind.
But by this experience I was made matter of my bufi-
nefs, and knew exactly when the proper feafon was to
fow; and that I might expect two feed times, and two
harvefts every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little difco-
very, which was of ufe to me afterwards: As foon as
the rains were over, and the weather began to fettle,
which was about the month of November, I made a
vifit up the country to my bower, where, tho' I had not
been fome months yet I found all things juft as I left
them. The circle or double hedge that I had made,
was not only tirra and entire, but tne ftakes which i had
cut off of feme trees that grew thereabouts, were all mot
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a wil-
low tree ufualiy moots ihe firft year after lopping its
head. I could net tell what tree to call it, that thefe
flakes were cut from. I was farprifed, and yet very well
pleafed, to fee the young trees grow; and I pruned them,
and led them up to grow as much alike as J could; and
it is fcarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into
in three years; fo that though the hedge made a circle of
about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for
fuch 1 might now call them,foon covered it; and it was a
compleat fhade,fuHkient to lodge under all the dry feafon.
£ 3 This
 
This made me refolve to cut fome more Hakes, m\4
make me an hedge like this in a femicircle round my
wail, I mean that of my Hrft dwelling, which I did;
and, placing the trees or ftakes in a double row, at -Love
eight yaruo diitance from my fir ft fence, they grew pre-
fently, and were at firft a fine cover to my habitation,
a-i-1 ;u"rer wards ferved for a defence a!fc> as I mail ob-
ierve in its order.
1 i und now, that the fcafcns of the year might ge-
nerally be divided, not into fummer and winter, as in
Europe; but into the rainy fealbns, and the dry feafons,
which were generally thus:

The rainy feafon fometimes held longer or fhorter, as
the winds happened to blow; but this was the general
obfervation I made. After I had found, by experience,
the ill confequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care tofurnilh myfelf with provifions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out; and I fat within doors
as much as poliible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
fuitable alio to the time) for I found great occafioa
of many things which 1 had no way to furnifti my-
felf with, but by hard labour, and conftant applica-
tion; particularly, I tried many ways to make myfelf
 
a bafket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpofe
proved fo brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved
of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a
boy, I ufed to take great delight in Handing at a bafket-
maker s in the town where my father lived, to fee them
make their wicker-wareand being, as boys ufually are,
very officious to help, and a great obferver of the man-
ner how they worked thole things, and fometimes lent
an hand, I had by this means lb full knowledge of the
methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials;
when it came into my mind, that the ;wigs of that tree
from whence I cut my flakes that grew, might poilibly
be as tough as the fallows, and willows, and ofiers, in
England; and I refolvcd to try.
Accordingly next day I wcat to my country*
houfe, as I called it, and cutting fome of the fmailer
twigs, I found them to my purpofe as much as I could
defue; whereupon I came the next time prepared with
an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I loan foiled,
for there was a great plenty of them: thefe I let up to
dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were
ft for uie, I carried them to my cave; and here during
die next leafon I employed jffpfclf in making (as well
as I could) a great many bafkets, both to carry earth,
or to carry or lay up any thing, as 1 had occafion j and
though I did not fmim them very handfomcly, yet I
made them fuffkieutly fer rice able for my purpofe; and
thus afterwards I took care never to be without them;
and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more; espe-
cially I made Itrong deep bafects to place my corn in,
ir.ilead of faeks, when I mould come to have any quan-
tity of it.
Having malic red this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, 1 benirred myfelf to fee, ifpof-
ftble, how to fuppiy two wants, 1 haJ no ve-TeU to
hold any thing tuat was liquid, except two rundlets,
which were almoft full of rum, a id fome glafs bottles,
fome of the common lize and others which were cafe-
bottles, fquare, for the holding of waters, fpirits, &e.
I had not io much as a pot to boil any thing in, except
a great kettle which I faved out of the fhip, and which
was too big for fuch ufes as I defired ic for, viz. to
E 4 make

make broth, and ftevv a bit of meat by itfelf. The le«
cond thing 1 would fain have had, was a tobacco pipe,
but it was impoffible for me to make one; however, I
found a contrivance for that too at laft.
I employed myfelf in planting rny fecond rows of
flakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the fummer,
or dry fealbn j when another bufinefs took me up more
time than it could be imagined I could fpare.
1 mentioned before, that I had a great mind to fee the
whole iiland, and that I had travelled up the brook, and
fo on to where I built my bower, and where I had an
opening quite to the fea, on the other fide of the ifland.
j now reluived to travel quite ac/ofs to the fea fnore on
that fide: So taking my gun, and hatchet, and my dog,
and a larger quantity of powder and mot than ufual,
wi;h two bifcuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raifins in
my pouch, for my flore, I began my journey. When I
had paiijd the vale where my bower ftood, as above, I
cms within view of the fea, to the weft; and it being a
very clear day, 1 fairly deicried land, whether an ifiand
f.r continent, I could not tell, but it lay very high, ex-
.tending from the we ft, to the W. S. W. at a very great
di it a-ice; by my gueis it could r*ot be lei's than iiKeen or
twenty leagues off.
i could not tell what part of the world this might be,
other wife than that 1 knew it mud be part of America;
and, 231 concluded by all my observations, mud be near
the Spanifn dominions, and perhaps was ail inhabited
by lavage?, where if 1 fhould have landed, i had been
in a worie condition than I was now; and therefore I ac-
quiefced in the difpofnions of providence, which I began
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing for the
bell .; I fay, I quieted my mind with this, and left
afHiciing myfelf with fj uitlefs withes of being there.
Bendes, after forne paufe upon this affair, i coniidered,
that if this Jand was the Spanifh coaft, I fliould certainly,
one time or other, fee iome veffels pafs or repafs one
way or other; but if not, then it was the favage coad
between the Spanifh country and Brafil, which were in-
deed the worft of favages; for they are cannibals, or
men eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the
human bodies that'fall into their hands.
With
 
With thefe confiderations I walked very lcifurely for-
ward, I Found that fide of the HI and where I now was
much pleafanter than mine, the open or favanna fields
fweet, adorned with flowers and grafs, and full of very
fine woods* I law abundance of parrots, and fain would
I have caught one, if poflible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to fpeak to me. I did, af:er fome pains-
taking, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a itick, and having recovered it, brought it home,
but it was fome years before I could make him fpeak.-—
However, at laft 1 taught him to call rue by my name
very familiarly; but the accident that followed, tho* it
be a irifle, will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I found
in the low grounds, hares as I thought them to be,
and foxes, but they differed greatly from all the other
kinds 1 had met with; nor could 1 fatisfy myfelf to eat
them, tho' I killed feveral; but I had no need to be
venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which
was very gooxl too; efpecially thefe three forts, viz.
goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoife; which, added to
my grapes. Leadenhail market could not have furnifhed
a better table than I, in proportion to the company.—
And though my cale was deplorable enough, yet 1 had
great caufe for thank fain els, that I was not driven ta
any extremities for food; but rather plenty, even to
dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
Outright in a day, or thereabouts; but f took fo many
-turns and returns to ice what difcove/ies I could make,
-that I camewesry enough to the place where [ reloJved.
to fit dowfi for all night; and then ekner repofe'd rrw-
felf inn tree, or fur.rouiKled myfelfwith a row offtakes
itt apright in the ground, either from one tree to ano-
ther, or fo as no wild creature could come at me without,
waking me..
As ioon as T came to the fea Chore, T was furp riled' to,
fee that 1 had taken up my lot on the woHl fide of the
iiland; for here indeed the more was covered with, in-
numerable turtles, whereas on the other fide I had
found but three in a year and a half. -Here wag alio an
infinite number of fowls of many kinds, fomewhich
15 5; "1 had,
 
 
 
 
I had not fecn before, and many of them very good
meat; but fuch as I knew not the names of, except*
thofc called penguins,
I could have mot as many as I pleafed, but was very
fparing of my powder and (hot; and therefore had more
mind to kill a fhe-goat, if I could, which I could better
feed on; and though there were many goats here, more
than on the other fide of the iJland, yet it was with much
more difficulty that I could come near them; the coun-
try being flat and even, and they favv me much fooner
than when I was on the hills.
I confefs this fide of the country was much pleafanter
than mine, but yet 1 had not the lealf. inclination to re-
move, for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I leemed all the while I was here, to
be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home. How-
ever I travelled along the more of the fea towards the
eaft, I fuppofe about twelve miles, and then letting up
a great pole upon the more for a mark, I concluded I
would go home again; and the next journey I took
fhould be on the other fide of the i/land, eaft from my
dwelling, and fo round till I came to my port again:
of which in another place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could eafily keep all the ifland fo much in
my view, that I could rtotmifs finding my firft dwelling
by viewing the country, but I found myfelf miltaken;
for being come about two or three miles, 1 found myfch'
defcended into a very large %illey; but fo furrounded
with hills, and thole hills covered with woods, that I
could not fee which was the way by any direction but
that of the fun, nor even then, unlefs I knew very well
the pofition of the fun at that time of the day.
It happened to my further misfortune, that the wea-
ther proved hazy for three or four days, while I was m
this valley, and not being able to ice the fun, I wan-
dered about very uncomfortably, and at lafl was oblige!
to find out the fea-fide, look for my pofl, and come
back the fame way I went; and then by eafy jcurnies
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot;
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things.*
very heavy.
 
 
In this journey my dog fiyprifed a young kid, and
feizcd upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and faved it alive from the dor, I had a great
mind to bring it home, if I could, for I had often been
muling whether it migin not be poffible to get a kid or
two, and io raile a breed of tame goats, which might
fupply mc when my powder and mot lhould be fpent.
1 made a collar to this little creature, and with a firing
which I made of dome rope-yarn, which 1 always carried
about me, I led him along, ihough with fome difficulty,
till I come to my bower, and there I inclofed him, and
left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from
whence I had been abfent above a month.
1 cannot express what a fatisfa&ion it was to me, to
come to my old hutch; and lie down in my hammock*
bed. This little wandering journey, without a fettled
place of abode, had been fo unpleafant to me, that my
own houfe, as I called it to myfelf, was a perfeel fettle-
ment to me compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me fo comfortable, that I refolved I would
never go a great way from it again, while it mould be
my lot to it ay on the ifland.
I repofed myfelf here a week, to reft and regale my-
felf after my long journey; during which, moft of the
time was taken up in the weighty affair of making a
cage for my pol, who began now to be a mere domeftic,
and to be pretty well acquainted with me, Then
I began to think of the poor kid, which I had pent ia
within my little circle, and refolved to go and fetch it
home, and give it feme food; accordingly I went, and
found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,
but was almoft ilarved for want of food; I went and cut
boughs of trees and branches of fuch lhrubs as I could
find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I
did before, to lead it away; but it was fo tame with
being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it; for it
followed me like a dog; and as I conftantly fed it, the
creature became fo loving, fo gentle, and fo fond, that
it became from that time one of my domeilics alfo, and
would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox was now
comeJ and I kept the 50th of September in the fame to.

ADVENTURES OF
lemn manner as before," being the anniverfary of my
landing on the ifland, having now been there two years^
and no more profpeft of being delivered than the fir/I
day I came there, I fpent the whole day in humble
and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful
mercies which my fjlitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely more
miferable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God
lad been pleafe&to difcover to me, even that it was
poffible I might be more happy in this folitary condi-
tion, than 1 mould have been in a liberty of fociety,
and in all the pleafures of the world.—That he could
fully make up to me the deficiencies of my folitary fiate,
and the want of human fociety, by his prefence, and the
communication of his grace to my foul, fupporting, com*
for ting, and encouraging me to depend upon his provi-
dence here, and hope for his eternal prefence hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how much
more happy.the life I now led was, with all its mifera-
able circumilances, than the wicked, curled, abominable
life I led all the pall part of my days; and now having
changed both my for rows and my joys, my very de-
lires altered, my affections changed their gull, and my
delights were perfectly new from what they were, at firil
coming, or indeed for the two. years pail.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or
for viewing the country, the anguifh of my foul, at my
condition, would -break, out upon me on a fudden, and
my very heart would-die within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the defarts I was in; and howl
was a prifoner locked up, with the eternal bars and bolts
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs, without re-
demption. In the jnidil of the greateft compofures of
my, mind, this would break out upon me like a frorm,
and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would.take me. in the middle of my work,
and I would immediately fit down and figh, and look
upon the aground for an hour or two together, and this
was fiill worfe to me; for if I could burfi out into tears,
©r vent«myfelf by words, it would go off, and the grief
iaving exhauEed itfcif would abate*
Sot
ROBINSON (fRUSOE. ioj
But now I began to exercife mylelf with new
thoughts-, 1 daily read the word of God, and applied
all the comforts of it to my prefent Hate. On« morn-
ing being very fad, I opened the bible upon thefe words,
I will never, never leave thee, nor forfake thee I Imme-
diately it occured, that thefe words were to me; why
clfe ihouJd they be dire&ed in fuch a manner, juft at the
moment when 1 was mourning over my condition, as
one forfaken of God and man? Well then, faid I, if
God does not forfake me, of what ill confequence can
it be, or what matters it, tho' the world mould all for-
fake me; feeing, on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and mould lofe the favor and bleffing of God,
there would be no comparifon in the lofs?
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind,
that it was pomble for me to be more happy in this tor*
faken, folitary condition, than it was probable 1 frVuiid
have.ever been in any other particular llate in the world;
and with this thought I was going to give thank* to
God for bringing me to this place.
I know not what it was, but fomething (hocked my
mind at that thought, and I durfl not fpeak the words;
flow can (I thou be fuch a hypocrite, faid 1, even audi-
bly, to pretend to be thankful for a condition, which,,
however thou ma> ft endeavour to be contented with, thou
would ft rather pray heartily to be delivered from? So I
Mopped there; but tho' I could not fay, 1 thanked God
for being there, yet I fmcerely gave thanks to God for
opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting Providences, to
fee the former condition of my life, and to mourn for
my wickedneb, and repent, I never opened the bible
or iliut k, but my very foul within me blefled God for
directing my friend in England, without any order of
mine, to pack it up among my goods; and for a flirting
me afterwards to fave it out of the wreck of the fhip.
Thus, and in this difpofuion of mind, I began my
third year; and though 1 have not given the reader the
trouble of fo particular an account of my works this
year as the firftj yet in general it may be obferved, that
I was very feldom idle; having regularly divided my
time, according to the feveral daily employments
that were before me; fuch as~Firft, My duty to God,
and
 
and reading the fcriptures, which I conftantly fet apart
fome time for, thrice every day.-—Secondly, The going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took
Hie up three hours in every morning when it did not
rain,—Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preferving, and
cooking what I had killed or catched for my fupply—%
theie took up great part of the day. — Alio, it is to be
coniiJered, that in the mid lie of the day, when the fun
was in tiie zenith, the violence of the heat was too great
to iiir out, fo that about four hours in the evening was
all the time 1 could be lupp^ed to work in, with this
exception, that ibme time* 1 changed my hours of hunt-
ing and working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the evening.
To this Ihort time allowed for labour, I deflre may
be added, the exceeding laborioufnefs of my work; the
many hours, which for want of tools, want of help,
wa it of Ikiil, every thing that f did, took up out of
my time.—For example, I was full two and forty days
making me a hoard ior a long fhelf, whicr< I wanted in
ni> CdVQ; whereas two fawyers, with their tools and
fa w-pit, would have cut fix of them out of the fame tree
in half a day.
My cafe was ihh—It was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, becaufe my board was to be a
broad one. The tree I was three days in cutting down,
and two more cutting oif the boughs, and reducing it
to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpreffible hack-
ing and hewing, I reduced both the fides of it into chips,
till it begat* to be light enough to move; then I turned
it, and made one fide of it fmooth and flat, as a board,
from end to end. Then turning that fide downward,
cut the other fide till 1 brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and fmooth on both fides. Any one
may judge of the labour or my hands in fuch a piece of
work; but labour and patience carried me through that
and many oilier things. I only obferve this in particu-
lar to mew the reaion why fo much of my time went
away with fo little work, viz. That what might be a
little to be done with help and tools, was a vail labour,
and required a prodigious time to do alone, and by
hand.
But
 
 
 
 
I
But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour
I went thro* many things, and indeed every thing that
my circumftances made neceflary tor me to do, as will
appear by what follows,
I was now in the months of November and December,
expe&ing my crop of barley and rice. The ground I
had manured or dug up for them was not great; fur as
1 obfcrved, my feed of each was not above the quantity
of half a peck; for I had loft one wftole crop by lowing
in the dry feaibn; but now my crop piomiled very well,
when on a fudden I found J was in danger of loiing it
all again by enemies of feveral forts, which it wasfearce
poflible to keep from it —At fir ft, the goats, and wild
creativ e* which I called hares, who, tailing the iweetnefs
of the blade, lay in it all night and day,as toon as it came
up, and eat it to dole, that it could get no time to moot
up into fialks.
This I law no remedy for, but by making an inclofure
about with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of
toil; and the moie, becaufe it required a great deal of
lpeed; the creatures daily fpoi ing my corn. However,
my arable land was bat final 1 j iuited to my crop, 1 got
it totally well fenced in about three weeks time; and
mooting fome of the creatures in the day time, I let my
dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a flake at
the gate, where he could Hand and bark all nightlong?;
fo in a little time the enemies for look the place, and the
corn grew veVy ftrong, and web, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beafts ruined me before, while my com was
in the blade, fo the birds were likely to rum me now,
when it was in the ear; for going along by the place to
fee how it throve, I law my little crop furrounded with
fowls of I know not how many torts, which flood as it
were watching till I fhould be gone.—I immediately let
fly among tht m, for 1 had always my gun with me
I had no iooner ihot than there a role up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not feen at all, from amonp- tiie corn
itfelf. t , b
This touched me fenfibly, for I furefaw, that in a few
days they would devour all my hopes: that I mould be
ftarved, and never be able toraife a crop at all, and
what ,o do I could not telU However, I rciolved not to
Jofe
 
 
 
 
 
lofe my corn, if poffible, tho* I mould watch it night
and day. In the firfl place, 1 went among it to fee what
damage was already done, and found they had fpoiled
a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet too green for
them, the lofs was not fo great, but the remainder was
like to be a good crop, if it could be faved.
I flaid by it to load my gun, and then, coming away,
I could eaftly fee the thieves fitting upon all the trees
about me, as if they only waited tiH I was gone away,
and the -event proved it to be fo; for as I walked off as
if I was gone, I was no fooner out of their %ht, but
they dropt down, one by one into the corn again. I w.*u
lb provoked, that I could not have patience to flay till
more came on, knowing that every grain that triey tat-
now, was, as might be faid, a peck loaf to me in the
confequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again,
and killed three of them. This was what 1 wifhed for;
fo I took them up, and ferved them as we ferve notorious
thieves m England, viz. hanged them in chains for a
terror to others. It is a 1 moil: impoflible to imagine, that
this fhould have fuch an effecl as it had; for the fowls
would not only not come at the corn, but in mort they
forfook that part of the ifland, and I could never fee a.
bird near the place as long as my fcarccrovvs hung there.
This I was very glad of you may be fnrc \ and about
the latter end of December,which was our fecond harvertr
in the year, I reaped my corn.
I was fadly put to it for a fey the or a fickle to cut it-
down, and all I could do was to make onp as well as I
could, out of one of the broad fvvords, or cutlaffes,
which I faved among the arms oat of the fhip. How-
ever, as my crop was fmali, I had no great difficulty
to cut it down: In fnort, 1 reaped it my way, for 1 cur
nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great
bafket which I had made, and fo rubbed it out with my
hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found
that out of my half peck of feed, I had near two bufheU
of rice, and above two bufhels and a half of barley,
that is to fay, by my guefs, for I had no meafure at that
time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I forefaw, that in time it would pleafe <iod to ftp-
ply

ply mo with bread; and yet here I was perplexed again,
tor I neither knew how to grind, or make meal of my
com, or indeed how to clean'it and part it; nor if made
into meal, how to make bread of it; and, if how to
inak&k, yet 1 knew not how to bake it. Thefe things
being adJcd to my defire of having a good quantity for
Itore, and to fecure a conitant fupply, I refolved not to
tafte any of this crop, but to preferve it all for feed
gainll the next feafon, and in the mean time to employ
my iludy, and hours of working, to accomplish this
great work of fupply in g myfelf with corn and bread.
It might be truly laid, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few
people have thought much upon; viz. the ftrange multi-
tude of little things nece/Tary in theproviding,producing,
curing, diciting, making and Enifhing this one article of
bread.
J, that was reduced to a mere ftate of nature, found
this to be my daily diicouragemcnt, and was made more
and more fenfible of it every hour, even after I got the
handuil of feed corn, which, as I have faid, came up
unexpectedly, and indeed to my furprife.
Knit, I had no plow to turn up the earth, no fpade or
dig it.—Well, this 1 conquered by making a
n fpade, as I obferved before; but this did my
mt in a wooden manner; and though it coll "me a
;v:ai many days to make it, yet for want of iron, it not
only wore out the fconer, but made my work the harder,
and made it be performed much worfe.
However, this 1 bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badnefs of
the perfo: mance. When the corn was fowed, I had no
harrow, but was forced to go over it myfelf, and drag a
great heavy bough of a tree over it, to fcratch the earth,
as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.
When it *as growing or grown, 1 have obferved al-
ready how many things I wanted—to fence it, fecure it,
mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, threm, part it
from the chaff, and fave it. Then I wanted a mill to
grmd it, fieves to drefs it, yell and fait to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it in; and all thefe things
I did without, as mail be obferved; and yet the com

was an inefdmnbl.e c mfurt and advantage to me too; bu?
all this, rib I (aid, made ever/ ihinr* laborious and teuiouj
to me, but that there was no help tor; neither was my
time fomaeh lo!s to mc,becauft I had div'ded ic; cer-
tain parr of it was every da . appointed to thefe works;
and as 1 rdolved to life none of the corn for bread, till I
had a greater quantity by me, i had the next fix nvm tin-
to apply nr> feli" wholly by labour and invention, to fur-
nifh myfelf with u to .'fib, proper for the ixrrbrmia<;- ad
the operations neceffary for the making the corn, wncn
1 had it, fit lor my ufe.
But halt I had to prepare more land, far I hid naw
feed enough to fow above an acre of ground. Before i
did this, I had above a week's work to iv^lw me a
fpade, which, when it was done, vvai a * < - y lorry one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to
work with it; however, I went through tha:, and lowed
my feeds in two large flat pieces of grcunJ, as near my
houfe as I coujd fiaJ tkm to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedrre, the Hakes of which were all cm
off that wood wh = en J had let before, which I knew
would grow, fo that in ore yiarks time I knew I (bould
have a quick, or living hedge, that would wain bu: lictle
repair. This work was not fo little, as to take me up
lefs than three months, becaufe great part of that time
was the wet feafon, when I could not go ^hvo td.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could net
go out, 1 found employment on the following eccafo":
Always obferving, that all the while I was at work I
diverted myfelfwith talking to my parrot, and teaching
him to fpeak, and I quickly learnt h m to know his
own name; and at lad to fpeak it pretty loud, Pol;
which was thefirft word I ever heard fp ken in the ifland,
by any mouth but my own* This therefore was not my
work, but an afliftant to my work; for now, as I laid*
I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows,
viz. I had long ftudied, by fome means or other, to
make myfelf fome earthen vefTels, which indeed I want-
ed iorely, but knew not whereto come at them: how- j
ever, confidering the heat of the climate, 1 did not j
doubt but, if I could find out any fuch clay, I might
batck up fome fuch pot as might, being dried by the
 
 
jim, be hard enough, and ftrong enough, to bear hand-
ling, and to hold and thing that was dry, and required
to be kept £>; and as this was neceffary hi preparing
corn, m,al, &o which was the thing 1 was upon, I re-
folvcu to make fome as large as I could, and fit only to
Hand like jars, to hold what 1 ihould put inio them. ^
11 wouM make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at
me:, to tell how many aukward ways 1 took to raife this
parte, what odd mis ihapen ugly things I made, how
many of' them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay
not being fliff enough to bear its ov. n weight; how many
crated by the over violent heat of the fun, being let out
too haihly; and how many fell too pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were drved; and, in
d word, hew, after having laboured hard to find he clay,
to Jig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and wor.c it, I
could not make above two large earthen ugly things, I
canr.o: call them jars, in about two months labour.
However, 43 the fun baked thefe two very dry and
hard, 1 lifted them very gently up, and fet them dowu
again in two <neat wicker bafkets, which I had made on
P'.Tpnfe for them, that th?y might not break; and, as
between the pot and the b^lket there was a li tie room
to fpare, 1 ilarFed it fail of the rice and baJey ftraw.s
and thefe two pots bei ig to (land always dry, I thought
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when
the corn was biuifcd.
Though I miican led fo much in my defign for large
pots, yet I made fever a! fmaller things with better fuc-
cefs; luch a. little round pots, fiat dimes, pitchers, and
pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to; and the
heat of the fun baked them ilrangely hard.
But all this would not anfwer my end, which was to
get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the
hre, which none of thefe could do. It happened after
(ome time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my
meat, when I went to put it out, after I had done with
it, I found a bioken piece of one of my earthen ware
veilels in the fire, burnt as hard as a itone, and red as
a tile. I was agreeably furpriied to fee it, and faid to
myfelf, that certainly they might be made to burn whole*
if they would burn broken,
Thit
 
 
 
This fet me to lludy how to order my fire, fo as to
make it burn me ibme pots, I had no notion of a kiln*
inch as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with
lead, though I had fome lead to dd it with; but I
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a
pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood all
round it with a great heap of embers under them: I
plied the fire with freih fuel round the out fide, and
upon the top, till I faw the pots in the infide red hot
quite through, and obferved that they did not crack at
all: when I faw them clear red, I let them Hand in that
heat about five or fix hours, till I found one of thera>
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the fand
which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence
of the heat, and would have run into glafs, if I had
gone on ; fo I flacked my fire gradually, till the pots be-
gan to abate of the red colour; and watching them all
iiight, that I might not let the fire abate too fall, in the
morning I had three very good, I will not fay handfome
pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as
could be defired; and one of them perfectly glazed with,
the running of the fand.
After this experiment I need not fay that 1 wanted no
fort of earthen ware for my ufe; but I muft needs fay, as
to the fhapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any
one may fuppofe, when I had no way of making them,,
but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would
make pies that never learnt to raife pa lie.
No joy at a thing of fo mean a nature was ever e*qual
to mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that
would bear the fire; and 1 had hardly patience to ftay
till they were cold, before I fet one upon the fire again,
with fome water in it, to boil me fome meat, which I
did admirably well; and with a piece of a kid T made
fome very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and
feveral other ingredients recpiifite to make it fogood as I
would have had it.
My next concern was to get me a Hone mortar to
ftamp or beat fome corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To fupply this want, I was
at a great lofs; for of all trades in the world I was as
*: perfe&lf
 
perfectly unqualified for a ftone*-cutter, as for any what-
ever ; neither hid I any tools to go about it with. I /pent
many a day to find out a great Hone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none
at all, except what was in the foiid rock, and which I
had no way to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks
in theiflandof hardnefs fufficient, but were all of a fandy
crumbling Hone, which would neither bear the weight
of an heavy peflle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with fand : fo, after a groat deal of time Joft in
fearching for a {tone, I gave it over, and lefolved to look
out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much eafier; and getting one as big as 1 had frrengtn to
Air, I rounded it, and formed it on the outfide with my
ax and hatchet; and then with the help of fire and in-
finite labour, made an hollow place in it, a.^ the Indians
in Brafil make their canoes. After this, I made a great
heavy peftle or beater, of the wood called the iron-
wood, and this 1 prepared anu laid byagainft I had my
next crop of corn, when I ptopofed to myfelf to gvmd9
or rather pound, my corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a fit-ve or fierce, to
drefs my meal, and part it from the bran and the hufk,
without which I did not fee it poffible 1 could have any
bread. This was a moft difficult thing, lb much as but
to think on; for to be lure I had nothing like the ne-
cefTary things to make it with; 1 mean fine thin canvafs,
or fluff to fierce the meal through. And here I was at
a full flop for many months; nor did I really know what
to do; linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I
had goat's hair, but neither knew 1 how to weave or fpin
it; and had I known how, here were no tools to work
it with; all the remedy that I found for this, was, that
at lafl I did remember I had among thefeamen's clothes
which were faved out of the fhip, fome neckcloths of
callico or muflin ; and with fome pieces of thefe I made
three fmall fieves, but proper enough for the work ; and
thus I made fhift for fome years; how I did afterwards,
I fhall mew in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be confidered,
and how I mould make bread when I came to have
corn; for, fir it, I had no yefl: as to that part, as
there
 
 
*here was no fupplying the want, fo I did not concern
xnyfelf much about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in.
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that alfo, which was this; I made fome earthen veffels
very broad, but not deep; that is to fay, about two feet
<iiameter, and not above nine inches deep; thefe I
burnt in the fire as 1 had done the other, and laid them
by; and when I wanted to bake/1 made a great fire
upon the hearth, which I had paved with fome fquare
tiies of my own making and burning alfo; but I mould
not call them fquare.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into em-
bers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, fo as to cover it all over , and there I let them
lie, till the hearth was very hot; then fweeping away all
the embers, I fet down my loaf, or loaves ; and whelm-
ing down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers
all round the out fide of the pot, to keep in, and add to
the heat; and thus, as well as in the bell oven in the
world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little
time a mere pailry-cook into the bargain ; for I made
mylelf feveral cakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed
J made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into them,
fuppofmg 1 had, except the flelh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all thefe things took
me up moll part of the third year of my abode here;
for it is to be obferved, that in the intervals of thefe
things, I had my new harveit and hufbandry to ma-
nage; for I reaped my co n in its feafon, and carried
it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear,
in my large ba'fkcts, till I had time to rub it out; for
I had no Hoar to threfh it on, Or initrament to threfh it
with.
And now indeed my flock of corn increafing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to
lay it up in; for the increafe of the corn now yielded me
fo much, that I had of the barley about twenty bufhels,
and of the rice as much, or more; infomuch that I now
refolved to begin to ufe it free y, for my bread had been
quite gone a great while; alfo I refolved to fee what
quantity would be fufficient for me a whole year, and to
low but once a year,
Upon
 
 
 
Upon the whole, I found that tne forty bafhels of
barley and rice were much more than I could cOniume iu
a year; ib I reiolved to io jull the lame quantity every
ye ..r that I fowed the lall, in hopes that iucJi a quantity
would fully provide mc with bread* &c.
Ah the while diefe things were doing, you may be fure
my thoughts ran many times upon the proipect of laud
wnich j h.ui seen from the other fide of the ifland; and
I was not without fecret wifhes, that I was on fhore
there, fancying that feeing the mail land, aiiG an in-
habited country, I might find lorn-" way or other to con-
vey myfelf farther, and perhaps at laft find iome means
of efcape.
fiut all this while f made no allowance for the dangers
of fuch a condition, and how I might fall into the hands
of favages, and perhaps fuch as I might have realon to
think far worfe than the Hons and tigers of Africa: that
if I once came iruo their power, .1 ihould run an hazard
more than a thoufand to one of being killed, and per-
haps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of
the Caribeau coafts were canibals, or men-eaters j and
I knew by the latitude that I could not be far <tf from
that fhore: that, fuppofe they were not canibals, yet
they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen
into th^ir hands had been ferved, even when they had
been ten or twenty together, much more I that was but
one, and could make little or no defence. All thefe
things, 1 iay, which I ought to have coafidered well
of> ani I did rail up my thoughts afterwards, yet
took none of my apprehensions at nvft; and my head
ran mightily uron the thoughts of getting over to that
fhore.
Now I wihY d for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the moulder oi mutton-fail, with which I failed
afiove a thoufand miles on the coaft of Africa; but this
was in vain. The a I thought I would go and look
on oar fhip's b at, which, as I have laid was blown
up upon the fhore a great way in the fbrm, when we
were fir it call away. She lay almoft where fhe did at
firft, but not quite; and was turned by the force of the
waves and the winds, almoft bottom upwards, againft
the high ridge of beachy rough fand, but no water about
her as before. If
 
 
If I had had hands to have refuted her, and have-
launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brafib
with her caly enough; but I might have eafily forefeen,
that I could no more turn her, and fet her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the ifland. However
1 went to the wood, and cut leaves and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, refolved to try what I could
do; fuggefting to myfelf, that if I could but turn her
down, I might eafily repair the damage Hie had re-
ceived, and ihe would be a very good boat, and 1 might
go to fea in her very eafily.
I fpared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitlefs toil,
and {pent, I think, three or four weeks about it; at lalt
finding it impoflible to heave it up with my little ftrengh,
] fell to digging away the faud to undermine it; and fo
to make it fall down, letting pieces of wood to thrult
and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done tkb, I was unable to ftir it up
again, or to get under it, much leis to move it forwards
towards the water; fo I was forced to give it over: and
yet, though I gave over the hopei of the boat, my deftre
to venture over for the main increafed, rather than de-
creafed, as the means for it feemed impoflible.
This at length fet me upon thinking whether it was
*not poiTible to make myfelf a canoe or periagua, fuck as
the natives of thote climates make, even without tools,
or, as f might fay, without hands, viz. of the trunk
of a great tree. This 1 not only thought poffible, but
eafy; and pleafed myfelf extremely with my thoughts
of making it, and with my having much more conve-
nience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not
at all confidesing the particular inconveniencies which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want of
hands to move it into the water, when it was made;
a difficulty much harder for me to fur mount than all
the confequences of want of tools could be to them;
for what was it to me, that when I had chofen a vail
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if after I might be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outfide into a proper fhape of a boat, and
burn or cut the infide to make it hollow, fo to make
a boat of it, if, after all this, I muft leave it juft there
where
 
 
12 I
where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water.
One would have thought, I could not have had the
lea 11 reflection upon my mind of my circumftance, while
I was making thi:; boat, but I mould have immediately
thought how I fliould get it into the fea; but my thoughts
were fo intent upon my voyage over the fea in it, that
I never once confide.red how I fliould get it off of the
land; and it was really in its own nature more cafy for
mc to guide it over forty-five miles of fea, than about
forty-five fathom of land, where it lay, to fet it afloat in
the water.
I went to work upon this boat the molt like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his fenfes awake. I
pleafcd myfelf with the defign, without determining
whether 1 was ever able to undertake it; not but that
the difficult / of launching my boat came often into my
head; but I put a flop to my own inquiries into it by
this foolifh anfwer, which 1 gave myfelf. Let mc firfr.
make it, I'll warrant Til find fome way or other to get
it along, when it is done.
Tins was amoft prepofterous method ; but the eager-.
nefs of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and
felled a cedar-tree: I queflion much whether Solomon
e ver had fuch an one for the building the temple at Je-
rufalcm; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the
iuwer part next the frump, and four feet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
letlencd for a while, and then parted into branches?
It was not without infinite labour that I felled this
tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at
the bottom,- I was fourteen more getting the branches
;*nd limbs, and the vaft fpreading head of it cut off;
which I hacked and hewed through with my ax and
Ratchet, with inexpreflihle labour: After this it coff. me
a month to fhape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to
Something like the bottom of a boat, that it might
^vini upright as it ought to do. It coil me near three
Months more to clear the in fide and work it out fo,
a* to make an exacl: boat of it: This I did indeed with-
J>-it fi-e, by mere mallet and chilli 1, and by the dint of
Jianl labour; till I had brought it to be a very hand-
Vol. I. t fome
 
 
 
 
fome periagua, and big enough to have carried fix and
twenty men, and confequently big enough to have car-
ried me and all in y cargo.
When 1 had gone thro* this work, I was extremely de-
lighted with it: The boat was really much bigger than
I ever faw a canoe or perigua, that was made of one tree,
in my life ; many a weary ltroke it had colt, you may be
fure, for there remained nothing but to get it into the wa-
ter ; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no qucf-
tion, but I fhoukl have begun the madell voyage, and the
molt unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken,
But all my devices to get into the water failed mq,
though they colt infinite labour too; it lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the
frit inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek:
Well, to take away this difcouragement, I refolved to
dig into the furface of the earth, and fo make a decli-
vity; this I began, and it coil me a prodigious deal of
pains: But who grudge pains, that have their deliverance
in view? But when this was worked through, and this
difficulty managed, it was ftill much as one; for I could
no more itir the canoe, than I could the other boat.
Then I meafured the diltance of the ground, and re-
folved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to
the canoe, feeing I could not bring the canoe down to
the water: Well, I began this work, and when I began
to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was to be dug,
how broad, how the ftufFto be thrown out, I found, that
by the number of hands I had, being none but my own,
it mull have been ten or twelve years before I mould
have gone through with it; for the more lay high, lo
that at the upper end it muft have been at leafl twenty
feet deep; fo at length, though with great relu&ancy, I
gave this attempt over alfo.
This grieved me heartily, and now I faw, though too
late, the folly of beginning a -work before we count the
cofr, and before we judge rightly of our own ftrength to
go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finifhed my fourth year
in this place, and kept my anniverfary with the fame
devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever before;
for by a conftant ifcudy, and ferious application of the
word

In the firit place, I was removed from ail the wicked-
nef; of the world here; I had neither the Init or the
Ik-flu the lull of the eye, or the pride of life: I had no-
ing to covet, for I hud all 1 was now capable of enjoy-

F 2 vetouuidsf
 
vttoufhefs, if he had been in my cafe; for I polTHTed
infinitely more than I knew what to do with. 1 had no
room for dcfire, except it was of things which I had not,
and they were but trifles, tho' indeed of great life to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as fdver, about thirty-fix pounds fterling; Alas!
there the nafry forry ufelefs fluff lay; I had no man-
ner of bufinefs for it ; and I often thought with myfelf,
that I would have given an handful of it for a grofs of
tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind rny corn; nay,
I would have given it all for fixpenny-worth of turncp
and carrot feed out of England, or for an handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink: As it was, I had
not the lcaft advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there
it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of
the cave, in the wet feafon; and if I had had the drawer
full of diamonds, it had been the fame cafe; and they
had been of no manner of value to me, becaufe of no life*
I had now brought my flate of life to be much eafier
in itfelf than it was at hrll, and much eafier to my mind,
as well as to my body. I frequently fat down to my
meat with thankfulnefs, and admired the hand of
God's providence, which had thus fpread my table in
the wildernefs: I learned to lock more upon the bright
fide of my condition, and lefs upon the dark fide; and
to confider what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted;
and this gave me fomctimes fuch fecret comforts, that I
cannot exprefs them; and which I take notice of here,
to put thofe di&ontented people in mind of it, who can-
not enjoy comfortably what God hath given them, be-
caufe they fee and covet fome thing that he has not given
them: All our difcontents about what we want, ap-
peared to me to fpring from the want of thankfulnefs
for what we have.
- Another reflection was of great ufe to me, and doubt-
lefs would be fo to any one that Should fall into fuch
diflrefs as mine was; and this was, to compare my pre-
fent condition with what 1 at firfl expected It mould he;
nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good
providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the fhip
to be caft up nearer to the ihore, where I not only
could come at her, but could bring what I got out ot
 
 
her to the fhore for my relief and comfort; without
which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence,
or gunpowder and (hot for getting my food.
I fpent whole hours, I may &y, whole days, in repre-
fenting to myfelf in the rnoft lively colours, how I muft
have acted, if I had got nothing out of the iliip ; how I
rould not have fo much as got any food, except fifh and
turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any or
them, I muft have penfhed fli It: That 1 (hould have
live,-, if I had not periihed, like a mere lavage: That if
I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had
no way to flay or open them, or part the fleih from thr
fkin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but muft gnaw it
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beaft.
Thefe refl-.&ions made me very fenfible of the good--
rr.ft of providence tome, and very thankful for my pra-
f .iit condition, with ail its hardlhip; and misfortunes:
And this part alfb I cannot but recommend to the reflec-
tion of thofe who are apt in their mifery to f ry, Is any
affliction like mine ? Let them confider, how much worfe
the cafes of fome people are, and what their cafe might
have been, if Providence had thought fit.
I had another reflection which a Hilled me alio to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing
my prefent condition with what I had defer ved, and had
therefore reafon to ex peel from the hand of Providence;
I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly deftitute of the
knowledge and fear of God: I had been well in-
ftrucled by my father and mother; neither had they been
^anting to me in their early endeavours, to infufe a
religious awe of God into my mind, a fenie of my
duty, an 1 of what the nature and end of my being
rtqdred of me; Butaias! fkliing early into the fea-
-J{lv6 li-i which of all the lives is the moft deftitute
oi the fear of God, tho' his terrors are always before
tocm; I fry, falling early into the fla-faring life, and
snto fearing compmy, ail that little fenfe of religion
widcii 1 had entertained, was laughed out of me by my
Hie- r.ntes; by an hardening defpifing of dangers, and
the views of death, whi h grew habitual to me; by
m/ i >)ig abfence from all manner of opportunities to
couverfe with any thing but what wa> like myfelf,
F 3 or
 
 
or to hear any thing of what was good, or tended to-
wards it.
00 void was I of every thing that-was good, or of the
kail fer.fc of what I was, or was to be, that in the
greate-l deliverance I enjoyed, fuch as my efcape from
Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese mailer of
t' e thip,-ay being planted fo well in Brafil, my receiving
the cargo from England, and the like, I never once had
the word thank God, fo much as on my mind, or in my
mouth; nor in the grcateil didrefs, had 1 fo much thought
as to pray to him; nor fb much as to fay, Lord, have
mercy upon me! Nc, not to mention the name of God,
unlefs it was to {wear by, and biafpheme it.
1 hid terrible refections upon n.y mind for many
months, as I have already obierved, on the account of
my wicked and hardened life part; and when I looked
about me, and confidered what particular providences
had attended me, fince my coming into this place, and
how God had dealt bountifully with me; had not only
pnriled me ids than my iniquity deferved, but had fo
plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hope?,
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
mercies in flare for me.
With thefe reflections I worked my mind up, not only
to rengnatlon to the will of God in the prefent difpo-
iiiion of my cireamitances, but even to a fincere thank-
fu'nds of my condition ; and that I, who was yet a living
man, ought net to complain, feeing I had not the due
p anifhmeLt of my fins; that I enjoyed fo many mercies,
which I had no reafoii to have expected in that place,
that i ought never more to repine at my condition, but
to rejoice, and to give daily thanks, for that daily
bread, which nothing but a cloud of wonders could havj
brought: That I ought to confnier I had been fed even
by a miiacle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens ; nay, by a long lerks of miracles; and that I could
hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part of the
world, where I could have been cad more to my advan-
tage: A place, where as I had no fociety, which was
my afEidion on one hand, fo I found no ravenous
beads, no furious wolves or tygers, to threaten my
life j no vencmous creatures or pcifonous, which I might
have

 
have fed on to my hurt, 110 lavages to murder and de-
vour me.
in a word, as mv life was a life of forrow one way, fo
it was a life of mercy another ; arid I wanted nothing to
make it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my
fenfe of God's goodnefs to me, and care over me in this
condition, be my daily consolation; and after I made a
juit improvement of thefe things, I went away, and was
no more f id.
i had now been here fo long, that my things w}ud\ I
brought on more for my help, were either quite gone, or
\crv much wa!led, and nearfpent.
My ink, as 3 obferved, had been gone for fome time,
all but a vew 1- t.de, which J eekcd out with water a little
and a little, til! it was fo pale it fcarcc left any appear-
ance of black upon the pa;v:r: Ab long as it lafted, 1
made ufe of it to i.ilnute down the day.> of the month
on which any remarkable thing happened to me ; and
r-"ft by calling up time1- p:m. J remember that there was
a ih-anee concurrence of dayj, in the various providences
which befel me, and which.; if I had been fuperaitioufiy
inclined t0 obferve days as fatal er fortunate, I might
have had reafon to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiofity.
Firit, I had obferved, that the fame day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away to
Hull in order to go to fea, the fame day afterwards I was
taken by the Sallee man of war, and made a flave.
The fame day of the year that I efcaped out of the wreck
of that fhip in Yarmouth Roads, that fame day of the year
afterwards I made my efcape from Sallee in the boat.
The fame day of the year \ was born on, viz, the
20th of September, the fame day I had my life fo mirar
culoufly faved 26 years after, when I was cart aftiore ia
this bland; fo that my wicked life, and folitary life,
both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wafted, was that of
roy bread, I mean the bifcuit which I bought, out of the-
ftip: This I had huhbanded to the lair degree, allowing
niyfelf but one cake of bread a day, for above a year;
and yet I was quite without bread for a year before X
got any corn of my own; and great reafon I had to be
F 4 thankful;
 
 
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, zs
has been already obferved, next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily : As t > linen,
I had none a good while, except fame chequered j'hirts
which I found in the chefrs of the other feamen, and
which I carefully prtferved, btcaufe many times I could
tear no other clothes on but a fhirt; and it was a very
great help to me, that I had among all the men's clothes
of the {hip almoll: three dozen of fhirts. There were
alfo lev era 1 thick watch-ro^ts of the Teamen, which were
left behind, bat they were too hot 13 \vj-\r; and the' it is
true, that the weather was fo violent hot, that there was
no need cf clothes, yet I could not go quite naked • no,
tho* I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could I abide the thought;- of it, though 1 was all alone.
One reafon why I cei:;d not go quite naked, wa;-, I
could not bear the heat of the fan fo well when quite
nuke:?, as with Tome clothes on; nay, the very heat fre-
quently bliftered my ikin; whereas, with a fhirt on, the
*ir itfelf made fome motion, and whiitling under the
fhirt, was twofold cooler than without it: Nomorecould
I ever bring myfelf to go out in the heat of the fun with-
out a cap or an hat; the heat of the fun beating with
fnch violence as it does in that place, would give me the
heatf-a- h prei::nrly, by darting fo directly on my head,
without a cap cr i.at on, fo that I could not bear it;
whereas, if 1 put on my hat, it would prcfently go away.
. Upon thefe \ iews I btgan to confidcr about putting
the few rags I had, wbich i called clothes, into fome or-
der; I bad worn cut all the waiftcoats1 had, and my bn-
fbu ts was now to try if I could not m?ke jackets out ot
the great waich-coa^ which I had by me, and with futh
oth^r raaterials as I had; fo I fet to woi k a U) loritig,
or rather indeed a botching; for I r.ir.de mod piteous
work -of it. However, 1 made fhift to make two or
three waiftroatwinch I hoped woidd ferve me a t
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but ibrry
fhift indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I faved the Ik ins of all the
creature* that I killed, I mc:n four-footed ones; and I
had hung them up icn:t rud cut wit!* Ricks in the fun;
by which' means*fome of ihem were fo dry and hard,
/ J that
 
that they w.re fit for little; but others, it fecms, were
v: ry wilful. The firft thing I made of thefe was a great
rap'for my lu^i, with the hair 0:1 the outfile to moot off
the rain; and this 1 performed fo well, that afttr this I
nude a fuit of clothes wholly cf thole fkins; that is to
f a \v. ifte.oat and breeches open at the knees, and
loth I.oofe; for they were rather waiting to keep rue
c .*>), lb 111 to keep me warm. I mu ft not omit to ac
k-e\vi dge, that they were wretchedly made; for if I was
a h:-A carpenter, I was a worfe taylor: However, they
\w-vi. firh as I made a very good fliift with; and when.
I w-, abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the
w iii-oat and cap being outmoft, I was kept very dry.
After this I fpent a deal of time and pains to make me
3ii umbrella: I wis indeed in grc?t want of one, and
h A :>. great mind to mike one : I had feen them made in
thcBr.fils, where they are very ufcfid in the great heats
which are there; and I felt the hests e/ery jot as great
here, rnd greater too, being nearer the equinox ; befides,.
as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a moil ufe-
fv:i thing to me, a? well for the rains as for heats. I
took a world of pains >t it and was a great while before
I onld make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I
thought I had hit the way, I (polled two or three before
I made one to my mind; but at laft I made one that
anfwered indifferently well; the main difficulty I found
w ;s to make it to let down. I could make it to fprcad;
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not
be portal)]e for me any way, but juft over my head,
whirh would not do: However, atlaif, as I faid, I made
one toanfwer; I covered it with (kins, the hair upwards,
fo clut it cafl off the rain like a penthoufe, and kept off
the f in fo effectually, that I could walk out in the hot-
teft of the weather, with greater advantage than I could
before m the cooleft; and when I had no need of it, I
could clofe it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely compofed by refigning to the will of God, and
tin owing myfelf wholly upon the difpofa! of his provi-
rien t; This made my life better than fociable; for
' n\ I began to regret the want of converfation, I
-vould afk myfelf, whether thus converting mutually
'F r with 
 
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may lay, with
even my maker, by ejaculations and petition", was not
better than the utmolt enjoyment of human fockty in
the world?
I cannot fay, that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me; but 1 lived on in the
fame couife, in the lame pofture and place, juil as be-
fore: The chief thing i was employed in, befides ray
yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and
caring my railing of both which I always kept up juil
enough to have fufficient (lock of the year's provifions
beforehand; I fay, befides this yearly labour, and my
daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one la-
bour to make me a canoe, which at lalt I finiflied: So
that by digging a canal to it fix feet wide, and four feet
deep,, I brought it into the creek, almolt half a mile.
As for the firir, that was fo vailly big, as I made it
without confidering beforehand, as I ought to do, how
I mould be able to launch it; fo never being able to
bring it to the water, or bring the water to it, I was
obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to
teach me to be wifer next time. Indeed the next time,
tho* I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it, at any lefs
cliilance than, as I have faid, of near half a mile ; yet as
I faw it was practicable at laft, I never gave it over; and
tho* I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged
my labour* in hopes of having a boat to go off to fea at
M.
However, though my little pariagua was nnimed, yet
the fize of It was not at all anfwerable to the defign
which I had in view, when I made the nrfl; I mean of
venturing over to the Terra Firma, where it was above
forty miles broad; accordingly, the fmallnefs of my
boat aflifled to put an end to that defign, and now I
thought no more of it: But as I had, a boat, my next
. defign was to make a tour round the ifland; for as I had
been on the other fide, in one place, croffing, as I have
already defcribed it, over the land, fo the difcoveries I
made in that journey, made me very eager to fee the
other parts of the coaft ; and now I had a boat, I thought
of nothing but failing round die ifland. .
 
 
For this purpofe, and that I mighty do every thing
with difcretion and conhderation, I fitted up a little malt
to my boat, and made a fail to it out of feme of the
pieces of the ihip's fails, which lay in itcre, and of which
I had a great ilore by me.
Having fated my mail and fail, and tried the boat, I
found Ihe would fail very well: Then I made little
lofeers and boxes at either end of my boat, to put pro-
viiions, neceffaries, and ammunition, &c. into, to be kept
dry, either from rain, or the fpray of the fea; and a lit-
tle long hollow place L cut in the in fide of the boat,
where I could lay ray gun, making a flap to hang down
over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella alfo in a ilep at the item, like a
mail, to Hand over my head , and keep the heat of the
fun off* me like an awning; and thus 1 every now-.
and-then took a little voyage upon the fea, but never
went far out, nor far from the lintl- creek: but at lalt
being eager to view the circumference of my little king-
dom, I refolved upon my tour, and accordingly i vic-
tualled my fhip for the voyage; putting in two dozen of
my loaves (cakes I mould rather call them) of barley-
bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a forxd I eat
a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and
powder with mot for killing more, and two large watch -
coats, of thofe which, as I mentioned before, I had
faved out of the teamen1 s chefts: thefa I took, one to lie
upon, and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the fixth of November, in the fixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you pleafe, that I fet
out on this voyage* and I found it much longer than 1
expected; for though the ifland itfelf was not very large,
yet when I came to the eafl fide of it, I found a great
ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the fea,
fome above water, fome under it; and beyond this a
&oal of fand, lying dry half a leauge more; fo that f
was obliged to go a great way out to fea to double that
point.
When I firft discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprize, and come back again, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to fea, and above
all doubting how I mould get back again; fo I came
F 6 to
 
 
to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an anchor
with a piece of broken grappling which I got out of
the fhip.
Having fern red my boat, I took my gun, and went
on more, climbing up an hill, which fetmed to over-
look tint point, where I faw the full extent of it, and
refolved to venture.
In my viewing the fea from that hill where I flood, I
perceived a ftroog, and indeed, a moft furious current,
whirh ran to the eafl, even ^ame clofe to the point; and
I took the more notice of it, becaufe I faw there might
be fome danger, that when I came into it, I might be
carried out to lea by the fti ength of it, and not be able
to make the ifland again: And indeed, had I not gotten
firfl upon this hill, I believe it would have been fo; for
there was the fame current on the other fide of the ifland,
only that it fet off at a farther di (lance; and I faw there
was a flrong eddy under the more; fo I had nothing to
do but to get out of the firfl current, and I mould pre-
fently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; becaufe the wind
blowing pretty frefli (E. at S. E. and that being jufl
contrary to the faid curr nt) made a great breach of the
fea upon the point; fo that it was not fafe for me to
keep too clofe to the more for the breach, nor to go too
far off becaufe of the ft ream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the fea was calm, and I ventured;
but I am a warning-piece again to all ram and ignorant
pilots; for no .ooner was I come to the point, when
even I was not my boat's length from the more, but
I found myfelf in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a fluice of a mill: It carried my boat along
with it with fuch violence, tha* all I could do, could
not keep her fo much as on the e 'ge of it: but I found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy,
which was on the left-hand. There was no wind
flirring to help me, and all that I could do with my pad-
dles fignined nothing; and I now began to give my-
felf over for loft; for, as the current was on both fides
the ifland, I knew in a few leagues diftance they
muftjoia *gain, and then I was irrecoverably gone;
 
nor did I fee any poflibility of avoiding it; fothat I had
no profpeft before me but of perifiiing ; not by the fea,
for that was calm enough, but of ft : rving for hunger. I
had indeed found a tortoife on the Ihore, as bigalmoftas
I could lift, and had tofled it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of frefh water, that is to fay, one of my earthen
pot? ; but what was ill this to beirn*; driven into the vaft
ocean, where, to be Cure, there was no (bore, no main
land or ifland, for a thouland leagues at Jeaft!
An 1 now I faw how eafy it was for the providence of
God to make the moft miferable condition tha man-
kind could be in, worfe. Now I looked back upon my
defolate folitary ifland, as the moft pleafant place in the
world, and all the happinefs my heart could wifh for,
w s to be there again: I flretrhed out my hand to it
with ea;?e wiflies; O happy defart! f .id I, I fhall ne-
ver fee thee more; O miferable creature! faid 1, whi-
ther am I going! then 1 reproached myfelf with my un-
thankful temper, and how I had repined at my folit ry
condition; and now what would I give to be on fhore
there again? Thus we neve; fee the true Hate of our
c ndition, till it is illuftrated to us by its contraries;
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want
of it; it is fcarce poflible to imagine the confternaticn I
was now n, being driven from my beloved ifland for
fo it appeared to me now to be; into the wide ocean,
almoft two leagues, and in the utmofl 'efpair of ever
recovering it again: however, 1 worked h<m], till in-
deed my ftrength was almolt exhaufted; and kept my
boat as much to the northward, that is, tow-ris the
fide of the current whi> h the eddy by on? as poffibly
I could; when about noon, as the fun paffed the me-
ridian, 1 thought I felt a little beeeze of wind in my
face, fpringing up from the S. S. E. This cheared my .
heart a little, and efpecially when in about half an hour
rncrcit blew a pretty final! gentle gale: by this time
I was gotten at a frightful diftance from'the ifland;
and, had the leaft cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another too; for ! hod nocorn-
pafs on board, and flionl I never have known how to
have fleered toward* the ifland, if had but once loft
^fiht-Qf it; but the weather continuing clear,, I applied
myfe.f
 
 
 
royfelf to get up my mail again, and fpread my fail,
Handing away to the north as much as poflible, to get out
of the current.
J iiit as I had fct my maft and fail, and the boat began
to ilretch away, I faw even by the clearnefs of the wa-
ter, feme alteration of the current was near; for where
the current was fo ftrong, the water was foul ; but per-
ceiving the water clear, I found the current abate, and
frefently I found to the eaft, at about half a mile, a
reach of the fea upon fome rocks; thefe recks I found
caufed the current to part again; and as the main ftreis
©f it ran away more foutherly, leaving the rocks to the
north-call, fo the other returned by the repulfc of the
rock, and made a ftrong eddy, which ran back again to
the north-weft with a very fliarp flream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought
to them upon the ladder, or to be refcued from thieves
juft going to murder them, or who have been in fuch like
extremities, may guefs what my prefer?t furprife of joy
was, and how gladly T put my boat into the ftream of
this eddy; and the wind alfo frefliening, how gladly 1
fpread my fail to it, running chearfully before the wind,
and with a ilrong tide or eddy under toot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again direclly towards the ifland, but about two leagues
more^owards the northward than the current lay, which
carried me away at firft; fo that when I came near the
ifland, I found myfelf open to the northern more of it,
that is to fay, the other end ©f the ifland, oppofite to
that which 1 went out from.
When I had made fomething more than a league cf
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it was
fpen% and faved me no farther. However, I found, that
being between the two great currents, viz, that on the
fouth-fide which had hurried me away, and that on the
north, which lay about two leagues on the other fide ; I
fay, between thefe two, in the weft of the ifland, I found
the water at leaft ftill, and running no way; and hav-
ing (till a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on fleer-
ing direclly for the ifland, though not making fuch frefh
way as I did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being thenwithi»
about
 
about a league of the ifland, I found the point of the
rocks which occafioned this diilar.ee vl retching out as is
defcribed bvrfosc, to the fouthward, and, calling otfthc
current more fouthwardly, had of courfb made another
eddy to the north, and thi -1 found very ilrong, but direct-
ly letting the way my courfe lay, which was due weir,
but ahnoit full north. However, having a frefh gale I
ilretched acrofs this eddy, flanting north well, and in
about an hour came within about a mile of the more,
where, it being fmooth water, 1 foon got to land.
When I was on more, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, refolving to lay afide
all thoughts of my deliverance, by my boat; and refrefh-
ing myfelf with fuch things as I had, I brought my boat
dofe to the more, in a little cove that I had efpied under
fome trees, and laid me down to .deep, being quite fpent
with the labour and fatigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great lofs which way to get home with
my boat; I had ran fo much hazard, and knew too
much the cafe to think of attempting it by the way I
went out; and what might be at the other fide (I mean
the well-fide) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run
any more ventures; fo I only refolved in the morning to
make my way weft ward along the more, and to fee if
there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in
fafety, fo as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coafting the more, I came
to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook,
where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and
where (he lay as if me had been in a little dock made on
urpofe for her: here I put in, and having flowed my
oat very fafe, I went on more to look about me, and
fee where I was.
I foon found I had but a little paifed by the place
where 1 had been before when I travelled on foot to that
Ihore ; fo taking nothing out of my boat but my gun
and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my
n^rch; the way was comfortable enough after fuch a
voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower
m^he evening, where I found everything flanding as I
left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I
laid before, my country-houfe. * I got
 
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the fhade
to reft my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell aPeep:
but judge you, if you can, that read my flory, what a
furprize I muft be in, when 1 was awaked out of my
fleep by a voice calling me by my name feveral times,
Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe, poor Robin Crufoe!
Where are you, Robin Crufoe? Where are you?
Where have you been?
I was fo dead afteep at firft, being fatigued with row-
ing, or paddling, as it is called, the fir ft part of the day,
and walking the latter part, that I dia not awake tho-
roughly; and dozing between fleering and waking,
thought I dreamed that fomebo y fpoke to me : but as
the voice'"ontinued to repeat Robin Crufoe, Robin Cru-
foe; at laft I began to awake more perfectly, and w. s at
firft dreadfully frighted, and flarted up in the utmoft
confirmation: but no fooner were my eyes ope , but I
faw my Poll fitting on the top of the hedge and immedi-
ately knew that this was he that fpoke tome; for juftin
fuch bemoaning language I had ufed to Ik to him,
and teach him; and he had learned it fb perfectly, that
he would fit upon my finger* and lay his 'ill clofe to
my face,. nd cry, Poor Robin Cr. foe, Where are you?
Where have you been ? How came you here? and fuch
things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
thst indeed it could be nobody elfe, it was a good while
before I could compofe my ft If. Firft, I was amazed how
the creatin e got thither, and then how he fhouldjuft keep
about the place, and no where elfe: but as 1 was well
fat Lifted it could be nobody but honeft Pol, I got it over;
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his name,
Pol, the fociable creature came to me, and fat upon my
thumb, as he ufed to do, and continued talking to me,
Poor Robin Crufoe, and, how did I come here? and,
where had I been ? jufl as if he had been overjoyed to fee
me again; and fo I carried him homeal ngwith me,
^ I had now had enough of rambling to fea for fome
time, and had enough tu do for many days to fit frill?
and reflect upon thi danger I had been in: I would
have been very glad to have had my boat again 00
my fide of the ifl&nd, but I knew not how it was
practicable
 
 
 
practicable to get it about: as to the ealr-fide of the
rlruid, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart would
ihrink and my very blood run chili, but to think of it:
;;:id to the other fide of the ifland, I did not know how
it might be there; but fuppoflng the current ran with
the fame foi\e againft the more at the eift, as it 1 afled
by it on the other, I might run the fame rifque of be-
driven down the ftream, and carried by the Hland,
«s l had been before of being carried away from it; f.)
vAth thefe thoughts I contented myfelf to be without
niiy boat, though it had been the product of many
months labour tj make it, and of fo many more to get
it into the fea.
In this government of my temper I remained near a
year, lived a very fedate retired life, as you may well
luppofe; and my thoughts being very much compofed,
;s to my condition, and fully comforted in refigning
myfdf to the difpofitions of Providence, I thought 1 lived
really very happily in a 1 things, except that of fociety.
I improved myfelf, in this time, in all the mechanic
exeroifes which my neceiTities put me upon applying
myfelf to; and I believe could, upon occafion, have
made a very good carpenter, efpecially confidering how
few tools 1 had.
Befldes this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in
my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make
them with a wheel, which I found infinitely eafier and bet-
ter; becaufe I made things round and mapeable, which
before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think
I never was more vain of my own performance, or more
joytui for any thing I found out, than for my being able
to make a tobacco-pipe; and tho' it was a very ugly
dmnfy thing when it was done, and only burnt red like
other earthen-ware, yet ,u it was hard and firm, and w uld
draw the fmeke, 1 was exceedingly comforted with it f
for I had always been ufed to fmoke, and there were pipes
in the (hip, but I forgot them at firft, not knowin g there
•yas tobacco in the ifland; and afterwards when I fearched
the (hip again, I could not come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I alfo improved much, and made
abundance of necefTary baikets, as well as my invention
(hewed
 
(hewed me, tho* not very handfome, yet convenient for
my laying things up in, or fetching things home in. For
example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up
in a tree, flay it, and drefs it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a bafkct; and the like by a turtle, 1
could cut it up, take out the eggs, arid a piece or two
of the flefh, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a bafkct, and leave the relt behind me: alfo
large deep balkets were my receivers for my corn, which
I always rubbed out as foon as it was dry, and cur jd;
and kept it in great ha'lets inilead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated confider-
ahly; and this was a want which it was impolliblc for
me to fupply, and 1 began ferieufly to confider what I
mull do when I mould have no more powder; that u to
fay, how I Ihouki do to kill any goats. I had, as 1 ob-
ferved in the third year of my being here, kept a young
kid, and bred her up tame; J was in hopes of getting
an he kid, but I could not by any means bring it to
pais, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could never
find in my heart to kill her, till (he died at la.it: of mere
age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my refidence,
and, as I have faid, my ammunition growing low, I fet
myfelf to fhidy fome art to trap and fnare the goats, to
fee whether I could not catch fome of them alive, and
particularly I wanted aihe-goat great with young.
To tiiis purpofe I made mares to hamper them; and
believe they were more than once taken in them ; but my
tackly was not good, for I had no wire, and always
found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I refolved to tiy a pit-fall, fo I dug feveral
large pits in the earth, in places where I had obferved
the goats ufed to feed, and over thefe pits I placed hurdles
of my own making too, with a great weight upon them
and feveral times I put ears of barley, and dry rice, with-
out fetting the trap; and I could eafdy perceive, that the
goats had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that I could
lee the mark of their feet: at length, I fet three traps
in one night, and going the next morning, I found them
all Handing, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was
very difcouraging; however, I altered my trap; and, not
 
 
to trouble you with particular going one morning to fee
niv traps, I found in one of them, a large old he-goat;
and, in one of the other7three kids, a male and t \v o females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he
v,: s fo tierce I durft not go into the pit to him; that is
t<> fay. to go about to bring him away alive, which was
v. hat I wanted; I could have killed him, but that was
not my ' ufmefs, nor would it anfwer my end; fo I
e'en let him out, and he ran away as if he had been
frightened out of his wits; but I did not then know
v, hat I afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a
lion : if I had let him ttay there three or four days w ith-
out food, and then have carried him fome water to
drink, and then a little corn, he would have been as
tame as one of the kids ; for they are mighty fagacious
tractable creatures, where they are well ufed.
However, for the prefent i let him go, knowing no
letter at that time; then 1 went to the three kids; and,
t; kiu;; them one by one, 1 tied them with firings to-
gether ; and with fome difficulty brought them all home.
It wns a good while befoie they would feed, but
t! rowing them fome Iweet corn, it tempted them, and
they began to be tame: and now I found, that if I ex-
pected to fupply myfelf with goats flefh, when I had no
po vurr or fhot left, breeding fome up tame was my
only way, when perhaps I might have them about my
houfe like a flork of fheep.
But then it prefently occurred to me, that I muff keep
the t;une from the wild, or elfe they would always run
wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was
to have fome inclofed piece of ground, well fenced ei-
ther with hedge or pale, to keep them up fo effectually
that thofe within might not break out, or thofe with-
out break in.
'Fids was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I law there was an obfolute neceility of doing it,
n>y Ml piece of work was to find out a proper piece of
ground; viz. where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to
keep thtm from the fun.
Thofe who under (land fuch inclofures, will think I
had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
a place \ ery proper for all thefe, being a plain open piece
of
 
 
of meadow-land or favanna (as our people call it in the
we ft em colonies) which had two or three little drills of
frefh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I
fay they will fmile at my forecaft, when I mall tell
them I began my inclofing of this piece of ground hi
fuch a manner, that my hedge or pale mult have been
at leafl two miles about; nor was the madncfs of it
fo great as to the compa&; for if it was ten miles about,
I was like to have time enough to do it in; but I did
not con/icier, that my goats would be as wild info much
compafc, as if they had had the whole ifland; and I
fhouid have fo much room to chace them in, that I
fhouid never catch them.
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about
fifty yards, when this thought occured to me; fo I pre-
fcntly flopped ihort, and for the fir.it Le ginning I refolved
to inclofe a piece of about 150 yards in length, and 100
yards in breadth, which as it would maintiin as many as
I fhouid have in any reafonable time, fo, as my flock
increafed, I could add more ground to my inclofur ,
This was rcling with fome prudence, and I went to
work with courage; I was about three months hedging
in the fir ft piece; and, till I had done it, 1 tethered the
three kids in the be ft part of it, and ufed them to feed
as near me as poifible, to make them familiar; and very
often I would go and carry them fome ears of barley,
or an handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand j
fo that after my indolure was finiftied, and I let them
Joofe, they would follow me up and down, bleating after
me for an handful of corn.
This anfwered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three and forty, befidts
feverai that I took and killed for my food; and after
that I inclofed five feverai pieces of ground to feed them
in, with little pens to drive them into, to take them as
I wanted them; and gates out of one riece of ground
into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flefh to feed on when I pleafed, but milk too, a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not fo much as think
of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was
really
 
really an agreeable furpnze; for now I fet up my dairy,
and had fometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day.
And as nature, who gives fupplies of food to every crea-
ture, dictates even naturally how to make ufe of it; io J,
that never milked a cow, much lefs a goat, or faw butter
or cheefe made, very readily and handily, tho' after a
great many effays and mifcarriages, made me both butter
and cheefe at laft, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his crea-
tures, even in thole conditions in which they feemed to
be overwhelmed in deftruction! How can he fweeten
the bittereft providences, and give us caufe to praife him
for dungeons and prifons! What a table was here fpread
tor me in a wildernefs, where I faw nothing at firft but
to perifh for hunger!
it would have made a ftoic frnile, to have feen me and
my little family fit down to dinner: there was my ma-
.itfty, the prince and lord of the whole ifland ; I had the
h*es of all my fubje&s at abfolute command; 1 could
hang, draw, give life and liberty, and take it away,
and no rebels among all my fubje&s.
Then to fee how like a king I dined took, all alone,
attended by my fervants! Pol, as if he had been my
favourite, as the only perfon permitted to talk to me;
my dog, which was now gr own very old and crazy, and
tound no fpecies to multiply his kind upon, fat always
;U my right-hand; and two crts, one on one fide the
table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a
bit from my hand, as a mark of fpecial favour.
But thefe were not the two cats which I brought on
fncre at firft; for they were both of them dead, and had
teen interred near my habitation by my own hands; but
one of them having multiplied by 1 know not what kind
of creature, thefe were two which I preferved tame,
whereas the reft ran wild into the woods, and became
indeed troublefome to me at laft; for they would often
tome into my houfe and plunder me too, till at laft I
u'as obliged to moot them, and did kill a great many;
2t length they left me with this attendance, and in this
plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be faid to want
a"v tking but fociety, and of that, in fomc time after
thls> I was like to have too much,
I was
 
I was fomething impatient, as I had obferved, to have
the ufe of my boat, tho' very loth to run any more ha-
zard; and therefore fometimes 1 fat contriving ways to
get her about the ifland, and at other times I fat myfelf
down contented enough without her. But 3 had a ftrange
nneafinefs in my mind to go down to the point of the
ifland, where, as I have fliid in my laft ramble, I went
up the hill to fee how the fhorc lav, and how the cur-
rent fet, that I might fee what I had to do: this incli-
nation increafed upon me every day, and at hngth T re-
folvcd to travel thither by land, and following the edge
of the fhore, I did lb : but had anyone in England been
to meet fuch a man as I was, it mull either have frighted
them, or raifed a great deal of laughter; and ss I fre-
quently flood ftill to look at myfelf, I could notbutfmile
at the notion of my travelling thro' Yorkfhire with fuch
an equipage, and in fuch a drefs. Be pleafed to take
a fketch of* my figure, as follows:
I had a great high fhapelefs cap, made of goat's fkin,
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the
fun from me, as to moot the rain off from running into
my neck ; nothing being fo hurtful in thefe climate:;,
as the rain upon the flefh under the clothes.
I had a fliort jacket of goat's (kin, the fkirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair of
open-kneed breeches of the fame: the breeches were
made of a fkin of an old he-goat, whofe hair hung
down fuch a length on either fide, that, like pantaloons,
it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and fhoes
I had none; but I had made me a pair of fomething, I
fcarce knew what to call them, like bufkins, to flap over
my legs, and lace on either fide like fpatterdafhes;
but of a mo ft barbarous lhape, as indeed were all the
reft of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's fkin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the fame, inftead of
buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either fide, of
this, inftead of a fword and dagger, hung a little faw
and a hatchet, one on one fide, one on the other: I
had another belt not fo broad, and faftened in the fame
maimer, which hung over my fhoulder; and at the
end of k, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both
made
 
made of goat's fkin too; in one of which hung my
powder, in the other my fhot: at my hack 1 carried
my hafket, on my flioulder my gun, and over my head
a great clunify ugly goats-fkin umbrella, but which,
after all, was the moil ncccflary tiling I had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it was
really not fo Mullato-likc, as one might expert from a
man not at aU careful of it, and living within nine or
ten degrees of the Equinox. My beard 1 had once fuf-
fcretl to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long;
but as I had both fciiTars and razors fuflicient, I had cut
it pretty Ihort, except what grew on my upper lip, which
I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiikers,
fuch as 1 had feen worn by fome Turks, whom I faw at
Sallce; for the Moors did not wear fuch, tho* the Turks
did: of thefe muftachio.c, or whifkers, I will not fay
they were long enough to hang my hat upon them; but
they were of length and fhape monftrous enough, and
fuch as in England would have palled for frightful.
But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I had
fo few to obferve me, that it was of no manner of con-
ference; fo I fay no more to that part: in this kind of
figure I went my new journey, and was out five or fix
days. I travelled firft along the fea-lhorc, directly to the
place where I firft brought my boat to anchor, to get
up upon the rocks ; and, having no boat now to take care
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the fame
height that I was upon before; when looking forward to
the point of the rock which lay out, and which I was to
double with my boat, as I faid above, I was furprized to
fee the fea all fmooth and quiet; no ripling, no mo-
tion, no current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a ft range lofs to underftand this, and refolved
to fpend fome time in the obferving of it, to fee if nothing
from the fets of the tide had occafioned it: but I was
prefently convinced how it was; viz. that the tide of
ebb fetting from the weft, and joining with the current
of waters from fome great river cn the more, muft be
*he occafion of this current; and that according as the
H'ind blew more forcible from the weft, or from the
north, this current came near, or went farther from
"he ftiore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went
up
 
 
 
up to the ro k again, and then the tide of ebb being
made, I plainly faw the current again as before. omV
that it ran farther otF, being near half a league from the
fhore; whereas in my cafe, it fit clofc upon the more,
and hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.
This obfervation convinced me, that I had nothing
to do but to obferve the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very eafily bring my boat about the
ifland again: but when I began to think of puffing it
in practice, I had fuch a terror upon my fpirits at the
remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I could
not think of it again with any patience ; but on the con-
trary, I took up another rdblution, which was more
fafe, tho5 more laborious; and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another periagua, or canoe;
and fo have one for one fide of the ifland, and one fur
the other.
You are to under/rand, that now I had, as I may call it,
two plantations in the ifland; one my little fortification
or tent, with the wall about it under the rock, with
the cave behind me, which by this time I had inlarged
into fevera! apartments or caves, one within another.
One of thefe, which was thedrieft and large fl, and had
a door out beyond my wall or fortification, that is to
iky, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
filled up with the large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great
bafkets. which wrould hold five or fix bufhels each,
where I laid up my (lores of provifions, efpechlly my
corn, fome in the ear cut offrfiort from the flraw,' and
the other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long flakes or
j)iles, thofe piles grew all like trees, and were by this
time grown fo big, and fpread fo very much, that there
was not the Jeaft appearance, to any one's view, of any
habitation behind them.
^ Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within
the knd, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of
corn-ground; which I kept duly cultivated and fowed,
and which duly yielded me their harveft in its feafon:
and whenever I had oxafion for mere corn, I had n ore
land adjoining as fit as that.
 
Befidcs this, I had my country-feat, and I had now a
tolerable plantation there alio; for firii, I had my little
bower, as 1 called it, which I kept in repair ; that is to
f.»\, 1 kept the hedge which circled it in, conihmtly fit-
ted up to its ufual height, the ladder Handing always in
the i?\fde ; I kept the trees, which at firil were no more
t'i-'in inv flakes, but were now grown very mm and tail;
1 kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
ihade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the
middle of this I had my tent always {landing, being a
f iec of a fail fpread over poles fet up for that purpofe,
and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and un~
der this I had made me a fquab or couch, v/ith the /kins
<n the creatures I had killed, and with other foft things,
2.'id a blanket laid on them, fuch ns belonged to our fea~
bedding, winch 1 had faved, and a great watch-coat to
O'vermc; and here, whenever I hud occafon to be ab-
fenr from my chief feat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this J had rny ench fares for my cattle,
t'Vit is to fay, my goats: And as A hrd taken an incon-
'.cable deal of pains to fence ana iriclofc this ground, I
x- - fo unealy to fee it kept entire, hit the goats mould
^iak thro', that 1 never left off, till with infinite labour
I ad ftuct the outf.de of the hedge fo full of (mall
*-Ke>, and fo near to one another, that it was rather a
F;il'" than an hedge, and there was fcarce room to put an
thro' btt.veen thenx, which afterwards, when thofe
1 ikv. grew, a» they all did in the next rainy feafon,
l:' -e the inclofure ilrong, like a wall, indeed Wronger
t:nn^ny wall.
} hn will teilify for me that J was not idle* and that
i 'pared no pains to bring to pafs what ever appeared ne-
c ilu v for my comfortable fupport; for I confidered the
^ ring up a breed of tame creatures thus at my
b:vi, would be a living magazine of flefh, milk, but-
ter and cheefe, for me, as long as I lived in the place,
u it were to be forty yeans; and that keeping them in
p1? reach, depended entirely upon rny perfecting my
|?.ciofures to fuch a degree, that I might be fure ojf
peeping them together; which by this method indeed
1 ^> effeaually fecured, that when thefe little Hakes
Vol« L G began
 
 
began to grow, I had planted them fo very thick, I was
forced to pull fome of them up again.
In this place alfo I had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my winter ftore of raifins,
sn<d whi»*h 1 never failed to preferve very carefully, as the
heft and mofr. agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and
indeed they were not agreeable only, but phynral, whole-
fome, nouriming and refrefliing to the laft degree,
As this was alfo about half-way between my other ha-
bitation and the place where I had laid up my boat, I
generally ftaid and lay here in my way thither * for I
iffed frequently to vifit my boat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order; fome-
times I went out in her to divert myfelf, but no more
'^hazardous voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Hone's cad or two from the more, I was foapprehenfive
of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the
currents, or winds, or any other accident: but now I
come to a new fcene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly furprized with the print of a
man's naked foot on the fhore, which was very plain to
be feen in the fand: I flood like one thunderstruck, or
as if I had feen an apparition ; I liftened, I looked round
me, I could hear nothing, nor fee any tiling; I went up
to a rifing ground to look farther : I went up the more,
raid down the more, but it was ail one, I could fee no
other impreffion but that one: .1 went to it again to fee
if there were any more, and to obferve if it might not he
my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was
exa&iy the very print of a fooi, toes, heel, and every
part of a foot; how it came thither I knew not, nor
rould in the kali imagine. But after innumerable flutter-
ing thoughts, like a man perfectly confuted, and out or
myfelf, 1 came home to my fortification, not feeling* as
we fay, the ground I went on, but terrified to the laft de-
gree, looking behind me at every two or three fteps, mis-
taking every bufli and tree, and fancying every flump
at a diftance to be a man; nor is it poffible to defcrihf»
how many various iliapes an affrighted imagination re-
prefented things to me in; how many wild ideas wtrc
iwmed every moment in my fancy, and what a ftraage
unaccottflWP^
 
 
 
/// r/?rf,tff/ rr/Me /rr /t/r^rr ^'oof.
unaccountable whimfies came into my thoughts by the
way.
When I came to my cafUe, for fo I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one purfued ; whether I went
over by the ladder, as firft contrived, or went in at the
hole in the rock, which 1 called a door, I cannot re-
member; for never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to
earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.*
I had no deep that night; the farther I was from the
occafion of my fright, the greater my apprehenfions
were; which is fomething contrary to the nature of fuch
tilingand efpeciaJJy to the ufual practice of all creatures
in fear : But I was fo embarrafled with my own fright-
ful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but difmal
imaginations to myfelf, even tho* I was now a great
u .iv oil it. Sometimes I fancied it mil ft be the devil;
and reafon joined in with me upon this fuppofition: For
how ihould any other thing in human fliape come into
the place? Where was the veifel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footftcps? And
how was it pcihble a man mould come there? But then
to think that Satan mould take human flinpe upon mm
in fuch a place where there could be no manner of o:ca-
fion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him,
and that even for no pvspoCe too (for he could not be
lure i flionid fee it), this was an amazement the other
way: I confidered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me, than this
oi the fnigle print of a foot: That as I lived quite on
the other ft le of the iiiand, he would never have been fb>
iimple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
fuk! to one whether I fhould ever fee it or not, and in
the find too, which the firft furgeof the fea upon an high
Vvind would have defaced entirely. All this feemed in-
confiftent with the thing itfelf, and with ali notions we
ufually entertain of the fubtlety of the devil.
Abundance of fuch things as thefe affifted to argue
rae out of ali apprehenfions of its being tlie devil: And
1 'yefently concluded then, that it muft :.e fome more
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
ifland ; and had been on more, but were gone away again
to fea, being as loth, perhaps, to have ftaid in this defo-
late ifland, as I would have been to have had them.
While thefe reflections were rolling upon my mind, I
was very thankful in my thought, that 1 was fo happy as
net to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not
fee my boat, by which they would have concluded, that
fome inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have
fea relied farther for me: Then terrible thoughts racked
my imaginations about their having found my boat, and
that there were people here ; and that if fo, 1 lhould cer-
tainly have them come again in greater numbers, and
devour me; that if it lhould happen fo that they fliould
not find me, yet they would find my inclofure, dtfhoy all
my corn, carry away all my Hock of tame goats, and I
fliould perifli at lait for mere want.
Thus my fear bammed all my religious hope ; all iliat
former confidence in God, which was founded upon
fuch wonderful experience, as ] had .had of his good-
nefs, now vanilhed ; as if he that had fed mc by miracle
hitherto, could not preferve by his power the provision
which he had made for tvc by his goodnef:. 1 re-
proached myfclf with my eaiim fs, thnt T would not fow
#;ny more corn one year, than would juit ferve me till
the next feafon, as if no accident could intervene to pre-
vent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground:
And this I thought fo juft a reproof, that 1 refolved fer
the future to have two or three years corn befcre-haiui,
fb that whatever might come, I might not perilh for want
of bread.
* How ft range a chequer-work of providence is the
life of man! And by what fecret differing fprings are
the affections hurried about, as differing circumitancei
prefent! To day we love what to-morrow we hate; to
aay we feck what to-morrow we Ihun ; to-day we de-
li re what to-morrow we fear; nay, even tremble at tr.e
appreheniljus of. This was exemplified in me at this
time in the mod lively manner imaginable; for 1»
whofe only affliction was, that i feemcd banifned from
human fociety, that I wai alone, circumfcribcd by t»ie
feoundlefc ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned
to
to what I call :i filent life; that 1 was as one whom hea-
ven thought not worthy to be numbered among the liv-
ing, or to appear among the reft of his creatures; that
to h;;\e l.;cn one of my own i'pecies, would have feemed
u> me a. raring me from death to Km, and the greateit
bfemng thav heaven it (elf, nrAt to the fuprcme bleiting
oi iahation, could bellow; I fry, that I ihould now
femule nt the very apprehenfiom'; of feeing a man. and
wai ready to fink I'd to the ground, at but the ihadow, or
h.:eut appearance of a man's having fet his foot on the
ifland."
Such is the uneven date of human life ; and it afford-
ed me a great man}- cnihiu.-- speculation:, afterwards, when
I h.r.i a Hule recovered my firlt furprize. J con fide red
that this was the fation of life, the infinitely wife and
good providence of God had determined for me; that as
1 could not forefee what the ends of divine wifdom might
be m all this, fo I was not to dlfpute his fovereignty, who,
as I was his creature, had an undoubted right by crea-
tion to govern and difpofe of me absolutely as he thought
fit; and who, as I was a creature who had offended him,
had bkewife a judicial right to condemn me to what
puniQiment he thought fit; and that it was my part to
fuhmit to bear his indignation, bccaufe I had finned
agamft him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only righte-
011S but omnipotent, as he had thought ft thus to punifli
and afflict me, lb he was able to deliver me; that if he
did not think fit to do it, it was my unqueftioned duty to
tCi!gn my fell absolutely and entirely to his will: And,
Cn the other hand, it was my duty a?fo to hope in him,
P^y to him, and qaieny to attend the dictates and di-
rection* of his dvdy providence,
« hc. fe thoughts took me up many hours days, nay, I
may fay, weeks and months-; and one particular eiteel of
T cogitations on this occaficn, I cannot oirdt; viz. one
corning early, lying in my bed, and filed with thoughts
shout my danger from the Appearance of lavages, I found
*t difcompoled me very much; upon which thefb words
the fcripture came into my thoughts, Call u/:n me in
tof of trouble, and I *;•/// deliver thee, and wuu /halt
&sr/j me*'
G 3 Upon
Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my bed, my heart
was not only comforted, but I was guided and encou-
raged to pray earneftly to God for deliverance: When
I had done praying, I took up my bible, and opening it
to read, the firft words that prefented to me, were, If ait
cn the Lorii> and be cf gccd cheer, and he fi.-nli iirmgihen thy
heart; iVait, I / n\ on the Lr-rd. It is impoflible to cx-
prefs the comfort this gave me ; and in return, I thank-
fully laid down the book, and was no more fad, at lea ft,
not on that occalion.
In the middle of thefe cogitations, apprehenfions, and
reflexions, it came into mv thoughts one dav, that all
thismitrht be a mere chimera of my own, and that this
foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on
ihore from my boat : This chearcd me up a little too,
and I began to perfuade myfelf it was all a deiufkm;
that it was nothing elfe but my own foot; and why
might not I come that way from the boat, as well as I
was going that way to the boat? Again, J confide red
alfo, that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not ,* and that if at laft this
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the
part of thole fools, who ftrive to make ftories of tpeclxes
and apparitions, and then are themfelves frighted at
them more than any body elfe.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I bad not ftirred out of my caftle for three
«hys and nights, fo that I began to ftarve; for provifion;
for 1 had link or nothing within doors, but fome barley-
cakes and water. Then I knew that my goats wanted
to be milked too, which ufually was my evening diver-
Hen ; r.nd the poor creatures were in great pain and in-
convenience for want of it; and indeed it almoft fpoiled
fonae of them, and almoft dried up their milk.
Heartening myfelf therefore with the belief, that th
was nothing but the print of one of my own feet (and
fo I might be truly laid to ftart at my own fhsdow,)
1 began to go abroad again, and went to my country-
houfe to milk my flo'k; but to fee with what ft ^'
I went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I
was ready, every now-and-then, to lay down my b
kit. and run for my life, it would have made any t'ne
1 7 have
r>
have thought I was haunted with an evil confcienc.e, or
that I had been lately molt terribly frighted; and lb in-
deed I had.
However, as I went down thu> two or three days,
. lid having feen nothing, I began to be a little bolder,
?.nd to think there was really nothing in it but my own
imagination; but I could not periuade myfeif fully of
this, till I mould go down to the fhore again, and fee
this print of a foot, and meafure it by my own, and fee
if there was any fimilitude or fitnels, that I might be
i.luired it was my own foot: T>ut when I came to the
place hrft, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my boat, I could not poffibly be on more any where
thereabouts: Secondly, when I came to meafure the
mark with my own foot, I found my foot not fo large by
a great deal: Poth thefe things filled mv head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the
higheft degree; fo that I {hook with cold, like one in an
ague, and I went home again, filled writh the belief, that
fame man or men had been on fhore there; or, in fhort,
that the ifland was inhabited, and I might be furprized
k fore I was aware; and what courfe to take for my fe~
lurity, I knew not.
O what ridiculous refolutions men take, when pof-
fefled with fear! It deprives them of the ufe of thofe
means, which reafon offers for their relief. The firft
thing I propofed to myfelf was, to throw down my ia-
clolni es, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods,
thaMhe enemy might not find them, and then frequent
the ifland in profpect of the fame, or the like booty;
then to the fimple thing of digging up my two corn-
fields, that they might not find fuch a grain there, and
ftiil to be prompted to frequent the ifland ; then to demo-
liftii my bower and tent, that they might not fee any
veiuge> of my habitation, and he prompted to look
farther, in order to find out the perfons inhabiting. .
Thefe were the fubje&s of the firft night's cogitation,
aifcr I was come home again, while the apprehenfions
Wj',ch had fo over-run my mind were frefli upon me, and
n'.v head was full of vapours, as above. Thus, fear of
ganger is ten thoufand times more terrifying than danger
Atidf, when apparent to the eves; and we find the bur-
G 4 den
den of anxiety, greater by much, than the evil which
we are anxious about; but, which was worfe than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble for the reiigna-
tion I ufed to practife, that 1 honed to have. I looked,
I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the
PhiliiHnes were upon him, but that God had forfaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compofe my
mind, by crying to God in mydiftrefs, and reding up;m
his providence, as T had done before, for my defence ;?:id
deliverance; which if I had done, ! had, at leu*, b<-n
more chearfully fupported under his new fin prize, and
perhaps carried through it with more refolutioji.
This confuiion of my thoughts kept me waging nil
night; but in the morning f fell afteep, and having by
the amufement of my mind been, as it were, tired, and
my fpirits exhaufled, I flept very foundly, and awak-'d
-much better compofed than I had ever been before : And
now I began think fe lately: and, upon the utrnoft
debate with myfelf, I concluded, that this ifland, which
was to exceeding pleafimt, fruitful,- and no farther from
the main land than as 1 had feen, was not ib entirely
abandoned as I might imagine: That altho' there were
no ftated inhabitants who lived on the fpot; yet that there
might fornetimes come boats off from the Ihore, who
cither with deiign, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by crofs winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived here i s years now, and had not mat
with the leail fhadow or figures of any people before;
and that if at any time they fhould be driven here, it wa-»
probable they went away again as foon as ever they
could, feeing they had never thought fit to fix there upo;i
any occafion, to this time.
That the molt 1 could fuooed any danger from, was,
from any fuch cafuai accidental landing of flragg'ing
people from the main, who, as it was Likely, it they
were driven hither, were here againil their v/dJs; io they
made no ftav here, but went orF again with a!l poiii>-
ipeed, felJom, flavin^ one night on thore, left r.hey ihoa.M
not have the help of the tides and day-light back aga;a *K
and that therefore 1 had nothing to do but to confider of
fome fife retreat, in cafe i mould fee any lavages land
upon the fpot.
Now
Now I began forely to repent tiiat J had dug my cave
fo large, as to bring a door through again, which door,
as i laid, came out beyond where my fortification joined
to the rock. Upon maturely confidering this, therefore,
I refolved to draw me a fecond fortification, in the fame
manner of a femicirclc, at a diiiance from my wall, juft
where I had planted a double row of trees about twel v e
years before, of whkh I made mention: thefe trees
having been planted fo thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they mould be
thicker and rlronger, and my wall would be foon nnimcd.
So that 1 had now a double wall, and my outer wall
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
every thing I could think of to make it ftrong; having
ia it (even little holes, about as big as I might put my
arm out at. In the iniide of this I thickened my waU
to about ten feet thick, continually bringing earth out
of my cave, and laying it at the frot of the wall, a*id
walking upon it; and though the feven holes I contrived
to plant the mtiiquets, of which 1 took notice that I got
ieven on more out of the ihip; thefe, I fay, I planted
like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, that fo i could fire all the feven
guns in two minutes time; this wall I was many a
weary mouth in finiming, and yet never thought myfclf
file till it was done.
When this was done, I ftuck all the ground without
rvv wall, for a great way every way, a, full with (rakes
n flicks of the ofier-like wood, which I found fo apt
to grow, as they could well Hand; infornuch that I be-
lieve I might fet in it near twenty thoufanH of ihem,leav-
"l"'-K ?. pretty large fpace between.them niid my wall, that
1 might have room to fee an enemy, and they m\ght have
no fhelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-
proach nay outer wall,
Tnuv in two years time I had a thick grove; and in
tve or fix years time I had a wood before my dwelling,
thrown fo mo-nil ro us thick, and ftrong, that it was in-
deed perfectly impafhble; uid no man of what kind
f >ever, would ever imagine that there was any thing
heyond it, much lefs an habita'ion: as for the way i
propokd myfcif to go in and out (for I left no aveno?)
it was by fetting two ladders; one to a part of the
rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room
to pla e another ladder upon that; fo when the two
ladders were taken down, no man living could come
down to me without miichiefing himfelf; and if they
had come down, they were ftill on the outfide of my
outer wall.
Thus I took nil the meafures human prudence could
fuggeft for my own preservation ; and it will be feen at
length, that they were not altogether without juft rea-
fon; though 1 fore fa w nothing at that time more than
my mere fear fuggefred.
While this was doing, I was not altogether can-Ids of
my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for
my little herd of goats; they were not only a prefent
lupply to me upon every oceafion, and began to be fuf •
ffcient to me, without the expence of powder and mot,
but alfo abated the fatigue of my hunting after the wild
ones; and I was loath to lofe the advantage of them,
and to have them all to nurfe up over again.
To this purpofe, after long confideration, I could
think but of two ways to preferve them; one was to find
another convenient place to dig a cave under ground,
and to drive them into it every night; and the other
was to inclofe two or three little bits of land, remote
from one another, and as much concealed as 1 could,
where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in
each place ; fo that if any difafter happened to the flock
i& general, I might be able to raife them again with
little trouble and time: and this, though it would re-
quire a gi eat deal of time and labour, I thought was
the moll rational defign.
Accordingly I fpent fome time, to find out the moft
retired parts of the ifland; and I pitched upon one, which
was as private indeed as my heart could wifh; for k
was a little clamp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where it is obferved, 1 al-
rnofl loft myfelf once before, endeavouring to come back
that way from the eaftern part of the ifland: here I
found a clear piece of land near three acres, fo fur-
rounded with woods, that it was almofl an inclofure by
nature; at leaft it did not want near fo much labour to
 
 
 
make it fo, as the other pieces of ground I had worked
fo hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of ground,
and in lefs than a month's time I had fo fenced round,
that my flock or herd, call it which you pieafe, which
were not fo wild now as at firft they might he fuppofed
to be, were well enough fecured in it. So without any
farther delay, I removed ten fhe-goats and two he-goats
to this piece; and when there, I continued to per-
feci the fence, till I had made it as fecure as the other,
which, however, I did at more lcifure, and it took me
up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expence of purely from
my apprehenfions on the account of the print of a man's
foot which I had feen; for as yet, I never faw any hu-
man creature come near the illard, and ! had now lived
two years under thefe uneafineflts, which indeed m?.cie
my life much lefs comfortable than it was before; as
may well be imagined, by any who know what it is to
live in the conftant fnare of the fear of man ; and this I
mint obferve with grief too, that the difcompofure of iny
n.ind had too great impreflions alfo upon the religion»
part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of foil-
ing into the hands of fuvages and canibals lay fo upon
my fpirits, that I feldom found myfelf in a due temper
for application to my maker; at lead, not with the fe~
date calmnefs and reflgnation of foul which I was wont
to do. !rather prayed to God as under great affliction
and preflure of mind, furrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and de-
voured before the morning ; and 1 muft teftify from my
experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulnefs, lave
and affection, as much more the proper frame for prayer
than that of terror and difcompofure; and that under
the dread of mifchief impending, a man is no more XX
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to
God, than he is for repentance on a fick bed; for the ft:
difoompofures affect the mind as the others do the body;
and the difcompofure of the mind mult neceifarily be-as
great a difability as that of the body, and much great-
er; praying to God being properly an act of the rr.ind,
not of the body,
G 6 But
But to go on ; after I had thus fecured one part of my
little living flock, I went about the whole ifland, fearch-
ing for another private place, to make fuch another de-
pont; when wandering more to the weft point of the
ifland than I had ever done yet, and looking out to lea,
I thought I faw a boat upon the fen, at a great diiTance i
I had found a perfpective glafs or two in one of the fen-
men's cheils, which I laved out of our {"hip; but T had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till
my eyes were not able to look any longer; whether it
was a boat, or not, I do riot know; but as I defcended.
from the hill, 1 could fee no more of it, fo I gave it
over; only I refolved to go no more without a perfpec-
tive glafs in my pocket.
When 1 was come down the hill, to the end of the
if and, where indeed I had never been before, 1 was pre-
fently convinced, that the feeing the print of a man's
foot, was not fuch a iirange thing in the ifland as I ima-
gined; and, but that it was a fpecial Providence that 1
was caft upon the fide of the ifland, where the lavages
never came, I ihoold eafilv have known, that nothing
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main*
when they happened to be a little too far out at lea, to
ihoot over to that fide of the ifland for harbour; like-
wife, as they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prifoners, would bring them
over to this fnore, where, according to their drcadhil
cuftoms, being all canabals, they would kill and eat
them: of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the fliore, as I (;vi
above, being the S. W. point of the ifland, I was per-
fectly confounded and amazed; nor is it poiiible for me
to exprefs the horror of my mind, at feeing the fhore
fpread with fkulls, hands, feet, and other bones of hu-
man bodies; and particularly I obferved a place wher"
there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth,
iike a cock-pit, where it is iuppofed the favage wretches
had fat down to their inhuman feaftings upon the bodies
of their fellow creatures.
I was fo aftonifhed with the fight of thefe tiling", that
I entertained no actions of any danger to niyieif ti"o>n
it, for a long while; all my apprehenfions were buried
in the thoughts of fuch a pitch of inhuman, hellifli bru*
tality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human na-
ture; which, though 1 had heard of often, yet I never
IkkHo near a view of before; in fhort, 1 turned away
my face from the horrid fpectacle; my ftomach grew
hck, and L was jail at the point of fainting, when nature
ciieharged the diforder from my ftomach, and, having
vvmitted with an uncommon violence, I was a little re-
lieved, but could not bear to itay in the place a mo-
ment; fo I got me up the hill again with all fpeed I
could, and walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the ifland,
1 itood itiil a while as amazed; and then recovering
myfelf, I looked op with the utmoft affection of my
foul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had cad my firft lot in a part of the world
where i was diftinguifhed from fuch dreadful creatures
as thefe; and that though I had e-tcerned my prefent
condition very miferable, had yet given me fo many
comforts in it, that I had ftili more to give thanks for
than to complain of; and this above all, that I had,
even in this miferable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of himfelf, and the hope of his hlefs-
ng, which was a felicity more than lufficiently equi-
talent to all the mifery which I had differed, or could
furter.
In this frame of thankfulnefs, I went home to my
crelie, and began to be much eafier now, as to the
f'fvxy of my circumfbnees, than ever I was before;
tor i obferved, that thefe wretches never, came to this
itVvrd in fearch of what they could get; perhaps not
foeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any tiling here;
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it, without finding any thing to their
purpofo: I knew I had been here now almoil eighteen
vcar.% and never faw the leaft footfte-ps of a human
creature there before; and might be here eighteen
npre as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if I did not
difcover myfelf to them, which I had no manner of oc-
co'ion to do, it being my only hufmeft to keep my-
- lelf entirely concealed where I was, unlets 1 found a
better
better fort of creatures than canibals to make myfelf
known to.
Yet I entertained fuch an abhorrence of the Ovnge
wretches that I have been {peaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman cuftom of their devouring and eating
one another up, that I continued penuve and fad, and
kept elofe within my own circle for almoft two years at-
ter this: when I fav my own circle, I mean by it my
three plantations, viz. my caftle my country dear,
which I called my bower, and my inclofure in the
woods; nor did I look after this for any other ufc than
as an inclofure for my goats; for the averfion which
nature gave me to thefe hellifh wrethes was fuch, that
1 was as fearful of feeing them as of feeing the de vil
himfelf; nor did I fo much as go to look after my boat
in all this rime, but began rather to think of making me
another; for I could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the other boat round the iflatui to me,
left l mould meet with fome of thofe creatures at fea, in
which, if! had happened to have fallen into their hands,
I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the fatisf;u4ion I had, that I was
in no danger of being di(covered by thefe people, began
to wear off my uneafmefs about them; and I began to
live juft in the fame compofed manner as before; only
with this difference, that I ufed more caution, and kept
my eyes more about me than 1 did before, left I fliouid
happen to be feen by any of them; and particularly, I
was more cautious of firing my gun, left any of them
on the ifland mould happen to hear it ; and it was there-
fore a very good Provi lenceto me, that I had fumiflied
myfelf with a tame breed of go its, that I had no need
to hunt any more about the woods, or fhoot at them;
and if 1 did catch any more of them after this, it vcas
by traps rn.l finres, as I had done before; fo that for
two years after this, I believe, I never fired my -guii
once"off, though I never went out without it; a net,
which was more, as I had faved three piftols out of th j
fhip. I always carried them out with me, or at leait
two of them/fticking them in my goat dun belt; I hke-
wife furnifhe 1 up one of the great cutlafles that I had
out of the (hip, and made m/ a belt to put it in alio;
fo that I was now a mofl formidable fellow to look at,
when I went abroad, if you add to the former defcrip-
tion of myfelf, the particular of two piftols, and a great
broad fword, hanging at my fide in a belt, but without
a fcabbard.
"Things going on thus, as I have {aid, forfome time,
I feemed, excepting thele cautions, to be reduced to my
former calm fedate way of living; all thele things tend-
ed to fuew me more and more how far my comlkion was
from being miserable, compared to fome others; nay,
to many other particulars of life, which it might have
pleafed God to have made my lot. It put me upon re-
flecting, how little repining there would be among man-
kind, at any condition with thofe that are worfe in
order :o be thankful, than be always comparing them
with thofe which are better, to aflift their murmurings
and complainings.
As in my prefent condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, fo indeed 1 thought that
the frights I had been in about thefe favage wretches,
and the concern I had been in for my own prefervation^
Had taken off the edge of my invention for my own con-
veniencies, and I had dropt a good deugn, which I had
<m( e bent my thoughts npmi; and that was, to try if I
r- oald not m ike fome of my barley into malt, and then
try to brew myfelf fome beer :' this wis really a whim-
irai thought, and I reproved myfelf often for the fim-
phcity of it; for I prefently f \\v there wouid be the
want of feverai things necdlary to the making my beer,
'-at it \\ouId be impo'Iibie for me to f ipply; as, fir ft,
r2fks to preferve it in, which was a thing that, as I have
(si)ierved already, I could never compafs no, though
J fpent not many days, but weeks, nr-.y months, in at-
tempting it, but to no purpofe. In the next, place, I
kad no hopes to make it keep, noyeaftto make it work,
n,° coPF*r or kettle to make it boil; and yet had not all
tkefe things intervened, I mean trie frights and terrors
i was in about the lavages, I had urv.lert: ken it, and
perhaps brought it to pafs too; for I frldom gave any
taing over without accornpKming it3 when I once had
^ m my head enough to begin it,
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I might
deftroy fonte of thefe mongers in their cruel bloody en-
tertainment; and, if poliiSic. five the victim they mould
bring hither to dc'troy. It would take up a larger vo-
lume than this whole work is intended to be, to fet
down all the contrivances I hntched, or rather brooded
upon in my thoughts, for the dedroying thefe creatures,
or at learl frightening them, fo as to prevent their com-
ing hither any more; but all" was abortive; nothing
could be poflible to take effect, unlefs 1 was to be there
to do it myielf; and what could one man do among
them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows and ar-
rows, with which they could moot as true to a mark as
I could with my gun?
Sometimes 1 contrived to dig an hole under the place
where they made their Are, and put in five or fix pound.-:
of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire,
would confequently take fire, and blow up aU that v. as
near it; but, as in the hvll place! mould be very lota
to wafte fo much powder upon them, my (tore being
now within the quantity of a barrel; fo neither could I
be fure of its going off at any certain time, when it might
furprize them; and, at belt, tint it would do little more
than juft blow the fire about their ears, and frig!it them,
but not iufiicient to make them foriake the place; fo 1
laid it afsde, and then propofed, that I wo'ild place my-
felfin amhulh, in fome convenient place, with my thiee
guns all double, loaded, and in the middle of thfir bloou)
ceremony let lly at them, when 1 mould be fure to kill
or wound perhaps two or three at every moot; and then
falling in upon them with mv three piltols, and my
fword, I make no doubt but that, if there were twent),
I ihould kill them all: this iancv pleaied mv thought*
for fome weeks, and I was fo full of it that I often
dreamt of it; and fometimes, that I was ju& going to
let By at tl^m in mv Ibep.
I went fo f ir with it in my. indignation, th"L I em-
ployed myfelf feveral days to.find out proper phice* *°
put myfelrin ambufcade," as I faid, to watch fcr them;
and 1 went frequently to the place it felf, which
new ^rown more familiar to me; and efncchilly while
jp.y mind was thus iilieci with, thoughts of revenge, and
ot a bh^-Iy putting twenty or thirty of them to the
f v-'Tcl, u.s I may call" it; but the horror I hat! at the
place, and at the fignals of the barbarous wretcues de-
vouring one another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the fide of the hill,
whrre \ was latisried I mi pit fecurely wait ti'l .1 f iw any
rd the boats coming, and might then, even before they
wuuM be ready to come on fhorcr convey mvieif unfeen
into thickets of trees, in one of which there was an

A D V E NTURES OF
able feme, for fo outrageous an execution, as the kill-
ing twenty or thirty naked favages for an offence, which
I had not at all t ntered into a uifcuffion of in my thought -,
any further than my pauions were at fir ft fired by the
horror I conceived at the unnatural cuftom of the pec-
pie of that rei.-xiTy, w ho, it feems, had been fuffercdbv
Providence, in his wife difpolltion of the world, to
have no other guide than that of their own abominable
and vitiated palfions; and confequently were left, and
perhaps had been for fome ares, to aft fuch horrid
things, and revive fuch dreadful cuftams, as nothing
but nature, entirely abandoned of heaven, and achirttd
by fome hellifh degeneracy, could have run them into:
but now, when, as I have faid, I began to be weary of
the fruit lefs excurfion which I had made fo long, and
fo far, every morning in vain; fo my opinion of the
aclion itfelf be^an to altar, and I began with cooler
and calmer thoughts to ronfider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in; what authority or call I had, to pre-
tend to b* judge and executioner upon thefe men as
criminals whom heaven had thought fit for fo many
ages to fuffer, unpunifhed to go on, and to be, as it
were, the executioners of his judgments upon one ano-
ther; alio how far thefe people were offenders againft
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood which they fhed promifcuoufly one upon ano-
ther: I debated this very often with myfelf thus; How
do I know what God himfelf judges* in this particular
cafe? It is certain thefe people do not commit this as a
crime; it is not againft their own confcienc.es reproving,
or their light reproaching rhem. They do not know it
to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of di-
vine juftice, as we do in aimoft all the fins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken
in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human
flefh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed necefla-
rily, that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that thefe
people were not murderers in the fenfe that I had be-
fore condemned them in my thoughts, any more than
thofe Chriftians were murderers, who often put to
death the prifoners taken in battle, or more frequently*
upon
upon many CKxafions, put whole troops of men to the
Avord, without giving quarter, though they threw
down their arms and fubmitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
ufare thev gave one another wa? thus brutith and in-
human, vet it was really nothing to me: thefe people
h.id done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or
I law it netei!arv for mv immediate prtfervation to fall
upon them, fomethiug might be faid for it; but that
I was vet out of the ir powe r, and they had really no
knowledge of me, and co'ifcquentlv nodeiign upon me;
and therefore it could not be juft for me to fall upon
thun: that this would juitify the conduct of the Spa-
niards, in all their barbarities prcc'tifed in America,
where they deflroyed millions of thefe people, who,
however they were idolaters and barbarians, and had
i 'V'. <-:;i bloody and barbarous rites in their cuftoms, fueh
as f«rn firing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as
to the Spaniards, vcrv innocent people; and th:;t the
rooting them out of the country is fpoken of with the
utmoft abhorrence and deteftatiori, even by the Spani-
ards themfelves, at this time, and by all other Chriftian.
nations of Europe, as a mere hut-fiery, a bloody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjuftiliable either to God or
man; and fur h, as for which the very name of a Spani-
ard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Chriftian companion: as if the king-
dom of Spain wore pv/ticulaily eminent for the product
ot a race of men, who were without principles of tcn-
dernefs, or the common bowels of pity to the miferable,
which is reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper
in the mind,
Thefe considerations really put me to a paufe* and to
a Kind of a full flop; and I'reganhy little and little to
eff of my d.J'ign, and to conclude I had taken wrong
r.:tnl;;re in my refolutions to attack, the fava^es; that
K lv: b not my bufinefs to meddle with them, unleftthey
attack me, and this it was my bufinefs, if poilible,
II prcvtnt; but that, if I were discovered and attacked,
then 1 knew my duty,
On the other hand, I argued with myfelf, that this
really was the way not to deliver myfelf^ but entirely
*'•> ruin and deffroy myfelf; for unlefs I was fure to kill
every one that not onTy mould be on more at that time,
but that fhould ever come on fhore afterwards, if but one
of them efcape to tell their country-people what had
happened, they would come over again by thoufaeds to
revenge the death of their fellows; and I ihould uv\y
"bring upon myfelf a certain deduction, which at pre ft ;nt
I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principle*;
nor in policy, J. ought one way or other to concern my.lt if
in this affair: that my bufinefs was, by all poflibic means
tc conceal myfelf from them, and not to leave the Jc.il
fignal to them to geefs by, that there were any living
creatures npon the ifiand; J mean of human fnape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I war. con-
vinced now many ways, that I was perfectly out of my
duty, when I was laying all my bloody fchemes for the
4?eitruction of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to
me; as to the crimes they were guilty of toward:, one
another, I had nothing to do with them; they were na-
tional punidimentsto make a jufl retribution for national
offences; and to bring public judgments upon thofe who
offend in a public manner, by fuch ways as belt pie ale
God. ^
This appeared fo clear to me now, that nothing wa; a
greater fatisfaftion to me, than that I had not been fuf-
fered to do a thing which I now faw fo much reifon
to believe would have been no lefs a fin, than that of
wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave moft
humble thanks on my knees to God, that had thus de-
livered me from blood-guiUinefs; hefeeching him to
grant me the protection of his providence, that I migi't
not fall into the hands of barbarians; or that 1 might
not lay my hands upon them, unlefs I had a more clear #
call from heaven to doit, in defence of my own life.
In this difpoiitiun , I continued for near a year aHer
this; and fo far was I from deluring an occafion for fah-
ing upon thefe wretches, that in all that time I never
once went up the hill to fee whether there were any o?
them in fight, or to know whether any of them had been
on more there, or not; that I might not be tempted w
renew any of my contrivances again ft them, or be pro-
voked by any advantage which might prefent itfelt,^
fall upon them ; only this i did, I went an4 removed
my boat, which I had on the other fide of the ifland, and
carried it down to the eait end of the whole iiland, where
i ran it into a little cove which I found under fome high
rocks, and where I knew, by reafon of the currents, the
fivages durft not, at leall would not, come with their
boats, upon any account whatfoever.
With my boat I carried away every thing that I had
left there belonging to her, tho' not ncceiiary for the bare
going thither; viz. a mall and fail, which J had made
tor her, and a thing like an anchor, but indeed, which
could not be called either anchor or grappling; however,
ir was the belt I could make of its kind. All thefe I re-
moved, that there might not be the ieafl fhadow of any
difcovcry, or any appearance of any boat, or of any
habitation upon the ifland.
Befides this, I kept myfelf, as I faid,more retired than
ever, and feldom went from my cell, other than upon
my conilant employment, viz. to miik my fhe-goats,
an! manage my little flock in the wood,; which, as it
wa> quite on the other part of the ifland, was quite out
i»t danger: for certain it is, that thefc favage people,
v. ho fometimes haunted this iiland, never came with any
thought.'; of finding any thing here, and confequently ne-
ver wandereJ off from the coafl; and I doubt not, but
they in»ght have been feveral times on more, after my
ypprehenfions of them had made me cautious, as well
?-'before; and indeed, I looked back with fome horror
J'-pon the thoughts of what my condition would have
**'ea, if I had chopped upon them, and been difcovered
beiore that, when naked and unarmed, except with one
gun, and that loaded often only with fmall mot. I
talked every when*, peeping and peering about the
'•-•nd, to fee what 1 could get: what a furprize mould
[ 1 avs been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's
had inflead of that feen fifteen or twenty favages,
ajui found them puriuing me, and, by the fwiftnefs of
the?r running, no poiiibiHty of my efcaping them!
t J^he thoughts of this fometimc.s funk my very foul
Within me, and diftreffed my mindfo much, that I could
not foon recover it; to think what I fhould have done,
and how I not only fhould not have been able to refill
them,
them, but even mould not have had prefence of mind
enough to do what I might have done; much lefs what
now alter fo much conficleration and preparation I might
be able to do. Indeed, after ferious thinking of thefe
things, I would be very mei.incholy, and fometimes it
would laft a great while; but I rcfoived it at lait all into
thankfulnefs to that Providence which had delivered me
from fo many unfcen dangers, and had kept me from
thofe mif hiefs, whirh I could no way have been the
agent in delivering myfelf from; becaufe I had not the
leaft notion of any fuch thing depending, or the leaft
fuppofition of its being poffible.
This renewed contemplation, which often had come
to my thoughts in former time, when firft I began
to fee the merciful difpofitions of heaven, in the dan-
gers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we
are delivered when we know nothing of it: how when
we are in a quandary (as we call it) a doubt or hefits-
tion, whether to go this way, or that way, a ferret
hint fliall direct us this way, when we intended to go
another way; nay, when fenfe, our own inclination, and
perhaps bufmefs, has called to go the other way, yet a

what fpring, and by we know not what power, (lull

gone, and even to our imagination ought to have go:u\

many like reflections, I afterwards made it a cctMhi

not fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fecret intima-

of the converle of fpirits, and the fecret communica-
tion between thofe embodied, and thofe unembodied;
and fuch a proof as can never be withftood: of which I
ihuJl have occahon to give fome very remarkable in-
liinres in the remainder of my folitary refidence in
this difmal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it ftrangc, if
I confefs that thefe anxieties, thefe conftant dangers I
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances
that I had laid for my future accommodations and con-
veniences. I had the care of my fafety more now
upon my hands, than that of my food. I cared not
to drive a nail, or chop a flick of wood now, for fear
the noife I fhould make mould be heard; much lefs
would I fire a gun, for the fame reafon; and, above
^11. I was very uneafy at making any fire, left the
fmoke, which is vifible at a great diftance in the day,
fhould betray me; and for this reafon I removed that
part of my bufinefs, which required fire, fuch as burn-
ing of pots and pipes, &c* into my new apartment in
the wood; where, after I had been fome time, I found,
to my unfpeakable coiifolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vafl way, and where, I
dare fay, no farage, had he been at the mouth of itf
would be fo hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would
any man elfe, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
fo much as a fafe retreat.
'f'he mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
g-re:U rock, where, by mere accident (1 would fay, if
J did not fee an abundant reafon to afcribe all fuch
things now to Providence) I was cutting down fome
*fo k branches of trees to make charcoal: and before
* r°on, I muft obferve the reafon of my making this
charcoal, which was thus:
f. 1 w*s afraid of making a fmoke about my habita-
tion, as I faid before; and yet I could not live there
Without baking my bread, cooking my meat <\c. fo I
contrived
 
contrived to burn fomc wood here, as I had feen done in
England under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal;
and then putting the ..fire out, I preferved the coal to
carry home, and perforin the other fervices, which lire
was wawring for at home, without danger or fmoke.
But this by the bye: while I was cutting down fume
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch
of low bruin-wood, or underwood, there was a kind
of hollow place: I was curious to look into it, and get-
ting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large, that is to fay, futRcient for ine to Hand up-
right in it, and perhaps another with me; but I mull cob-
fefs to you, I made more hade out than I did in; when
looking further into the place, which was perfectly dark,
J faw two broad mining eyes of fome creature, whether
devil or man, I knew not, which twinkled like twoftarcf
the dim light from the cave's mouth mining directly in,
and making the reflection.
However, after fome paufe, I recovered myfelf, and
began to call myfelf a thoufand fools, and tell my flit,
that he that was afraid to fee the devil, was not fit to
live.twenty years in an ifland all alone, and that I duril
to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myfelf: upon this, plucking up my cou-
rage, I took up a large firebrand, and in I rufhed agair,
with the ftick flaming in my hand: I had not gore
three fteps in, but I was almoft as much frightened ;u
I was before; for I heard a very loud iigh, like that ui
a man in fome pain; and it was followed by a broken
noife, as if of words half expreffed, and then a deep
figh again: I Hepped back, and was indeed ft ruck with
fuch a furprlze, that it put me into a cold fweat;
and if I had had an hat on my head, I will not anfwerfor
it, that my hair might not have lifted it off. But fb.H
plucking up my fpirits as well as I could, and encou-
raging myfelf a little, with confidering that the power
and prefence of God was every-where, and was able u»
protect me; upon this I Hepped forward again, and hy
the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over
my head, I faw lying on the ground a moit monhrous
frightfu: old he-goat, jud making his will, as we fa}%
gulping for life, and dying indeed of a mere old age.
 
 
 
 
h
1 ftirred him a little to fee if I could get him out, and
e aflayed to get up, but was not able to raife himfclf;
„nd i thought with myfelf, he might e'en lie there; for
if he had frightened me fo, he would certainly fright any
of the lavages, if any of them fhould be fo hardy as to
tome 111 there, while he had any life in him.
1 was now recovered from my furprife, and began to
look round me, when I found the cave wr.s but very
lir.ati; that.is to fay, it might be about twelve feet over,
but in no manner of ihape, either round 01 fquare, no
hands having ever been employed in making it but thofe
of mere nature: I obferved alfo, that there was a place
at the farther fide of it that went in farther, but fo low,
that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to
$et into it, and whither it went, I knew not; fo having
no candle, I gave it over for fome time, but refolved to
come again the next clay, provided with candles and a
t hitler-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
nrulquets, with fome wild fire in the pan.
Aaoidingly, the next day, I came provided with fix
Mrge candles of my own making, fori made very good
ladles now of goat's tallow; and, going into this low
p'ace, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have
laid, almoft ten yards; which, by the way, I thought
was adventure bold enough, confidering that I knew not
\losv |ar mjght g0? or %v]lat was beyond it: When 1
wa« got thro' theftreight, I found the roof rofe higher
up» I believe near twenty feet; but never was fuch a
prions light feen in the'ifland, I dare fay, as it wa , to
look round the fides and roof of this vault or rave:
Hie walls reflected an hundred thoufand lights to me
hem my two candles; what it was in the rock, whether
(l*amonds or any other precious ftonts, or gold, which
r/ther funpofed it to be, I knew not,
The place I was in was a moil delightful cavity, or
grotto, of its kind, as ecu Id be expected, though per-
'j|!y c^rk; the floor was dry and level and had a fort
*IllaN loofe gravel upon it; fo that there was no nau-
?oti CI ^ture to be ieen; neither was there any damp
?r^ct on the fides of the roof: The only difficulty in
^ ^ss the entrance, which, however, as it was a place
Li lf xmtT> and fuch a retreat as I wanted, I thought
^^i. H that
 
 
 
 
 
that was a convenience; fo that I was really rejoiced at
the difcovery, and refolved, without any delay, to bring
fbme of thofe things which I was mo ft anxious about, to
this place; particularly, t refolved to bring hither my
magazine of powder, and all my fpare arms, viz. two
fowling-pieces (for I had three in all) and three muf-
quets (for of them I had eight in all j) fo I kept at my
caftle only five,-which flood ready mounted, like pieces
of cannpn, on my outmoft fence; and were ready alfo to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occafion of removing my ammunition, I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I took
up out of the fea, and which had been wet ;and I found,
that the water had penetrated about three or four inches
into the powder on every fide, which, caking and grow-
ing hard, had prefervedthe infide like a kernel in aftiell;
fo that I had near fixty pounds of very good powder in
the centre of the cafk; and this was an agreeable difco-
very to me at that time; fo I carried ail away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my caftle, for fear of a furprife of any kind,
i alfo carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myfelf now like one of the antient giants,
which were faid to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I perfuaded myfelf
while 1 was here, if five hundred favages were to hunt
me, they could never find me out; or if they did, they
would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after 1 made this difco-
very; and 1 found it much eafier to dig a great hoi-*
there, and throw him in, and cover him with earth, than
to drag him out: So I interred him there, to prevent of-
fence to my nofe.
I was now in my twenty-third year of refidenee in this
ifland, and was fo naturalized to the place, and to the man-
ner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty,
that no favages would come to the place to difturb mc, I
could have been content to have capitulated for fpending
the reft of my time there, even to the laft moment, till I
had laid me down and died, like the old goat* in the cave:
I had alfo arrived to feme little diveriions and amufenients
which
 
 
 
 
vAuch made the lime pafs more pleafantly with me a great
1 eai than it did before; as, firit, I had taught my pol, as
I noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly, and
talked fo articulately And plain, that it was very pleafant
to me; and he lived with me no lefs than fix and twenty
years: How long he might live afterwards, I knew not;
tno? i know they have a notion in the Brafils, that they
live an hundred years; perhaps fome of my pols may be
iiiive there ilill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this
fiay ; I wllh no Engliihman the ill luck to come there and
bear them; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
was the devil. My dog was a very pleafant and loving
companion to me for no lefs than fixteen years of my
time, and then died of mere old age; as for my cats,
they multiplied, as I have obferved, to that degree, that I
vfas obliged to moot feveral of them at firft, to keep them
horn devouring me, and all I had; but at length, when
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and af-
ter fbme time continually dri ving them from me, and let-
ting them have no provifion with me, they all ran wild
into the woods,, except two or three favourites, which I
kept tame, and whofe young, when they had any, I
always drowned, and thefe were part of my family: Be-
fjdes thefe, I always kept two or three houfhould kids
rbout me, which I taught to feed out of my hand; and I
l a l alfo more parrots, which talked pretty well, and
would all call Robin Crufoe, but none like my firfl: nor,
indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had
done with him: I had alfo feveral tame fca-fowls, whofe
names I know not, which I caught upon the more, and
cut their wings; and the little flakes, which I had plant-
ed, before my caftle wall, being now grown up to a good
thick grove, thefe fowls all lived among thefe low trees,
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fo
that, as I laid above, I began to be very well contented
with the life I led, if it might but have been fecured
from the dread of favages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amifs for all people who mall meet with my ftory, to
pake this juft observation from it; viz. How frequently
m the courfe of our lives, the evil, which in itfelf
wefeefc moft to ihun, and which, when we are fallen
H 2 into,
 
 
 
 
r7t ADVENTURES OF
into, is the moft dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very
means or doer of our deliverance, by which alone we
can he raifed again from the affliction we are fallen into:
I could give many examples of this in the courfe of my
unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particu-
larly remnkable, than in the circumftances of my laft
years of folitary refidence in this ifland.
It was now the month of December, as I faid above,
in my twenty-third year; and this being the fouthern
fblfticc, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular
time of my harveft, and required my being pretty much
abroad in die fields; when going out pretty early in the
morning even before it was thorough day-light, I was
furprifed with feeing a light of fome fire upon thefhore,
at a difhmce from me of about two miles, towards the
end of the ifland, where I had obferved fome favages
had been, as before ; but not on the other fide; but, to
my great affliction, it was on my fide of the ifland.
1 was indeed terribly furprifed at the fight, and flopped
fhort within my grove, not daring to go out. left I might
be furprifed; and yet I had no more peace within, from
the apprehenfions I had, ihat if thefe favages, in ram-
bling over the ifland, fhould find my corn {landing, or
cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would
immediately conclude, that there were people in the
place, and would then never give over till they found
me out: In this extremity I went back diredtly to nry
caftle, pulled up the ladder after me, having made all
things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myfelf within, putting myfelf in a
pofture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as I tailed
them, that is to fay, my mufqnets, 'w hich were mounted
upon ny new fortification, and all my piftols, and n>
folyed to defend myfelf to the laft gafp; not forgetting
ferioufly to recommend myfelf to thedivine protection,
and earneftly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this pofture I con-
tinued about two hours, but began to be mighty impatunt
for intelligence abroad for I had no fpies to lend out.
After fitting a while longer, and mufing what 1
lliould do in this cafe, 1 was not able to bear fitting in
* , ignorance
 
ignorance longer j fo fettingup my ladder to the fide of
the hill, where there was a flat place, as I obferved be-
fore, and then pulling the ladder up after rAc, 1 fet it up
again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and pulling
out rnv perfpe£fcive-glafs, whi h I had taken onpurpofe,
1 laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and be-
£.1:1 to look for the place: I presently found there were
no Ids than nine naked favages fitting round a final! fire
they had made; not to warm them, tor they had no need
of that, the weather being extreme hot; but, as ITup-
pofrd, to drels fome of their barbarous diet of human
& ih, which they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead, I could not know.
They had twocanoes with them, which they had ha]N
ff? up upon the fhore; and as it was then tide of ebb,
they teemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go
aw ay again. It is not eafy to imagine what confufiou
this fight put me.into, efpeciaily feeing them come on
my fide the ifland, and fonear me too; but when 1 of**
fen/ed their coming muff, be always with the current of
the ebb, I began afterwards to be more fedate in my
mind, being fatisfied that I might go abroad with faiety,
all the time of tide of flood, if they were not on fhore
before; and having made thisobfervation I went abroad
about my harveft work with the more compofure.
As I expected, fo it proved; for as foon as the tide
made to the wefhvard, I faw them all take boat, and row
(or paddle, as we call it) all away: I fhould have ob-
f erved, that for an hour and more before they went off,
they went to dancing, and I could eafily difcern their
poftures and geftures bynryglafles : 1 could not perceive,
by my niceff. obfervation, but that they were flark-nakaf,
and had not the leaft covering upon them ; but whether
they were men or women, that I could notdiftinguiih.
As foon as I faw them fhipped and gone, I took twp
guns upon my flioulders, and two p ffob at my girdle,
s»nd my great fword by my fide, without a fcabbard;
and with all the fpeed L was able to make, I went away to
the hill, where I had difcovered the firft appearance of all.
As foon as I got thither, which was not lefs than two hours
(for I could not go apace, being fo loaded with arms as
I was) I perceived there had been three canoes more of
H 3 favages
 
 
 
 
 
favages on that place; and looking out further, T faw
they were all at lea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadf ul light to mo, especially when going
down to the more, I could fee the marks of horror which
the difmal work they had been about had left behind it,
viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flefh of human
bodies, eaten and devoured by thofe wretches, with mer-
riment and fport. I was fo {\l\cd with indignation at the
fight, that I began now to premediatethe de7lrucT:ion of the
.-next that i faw there, let them be who or how many foever.
It feemed evident to me, that the vifits which they
thus made to this ifland, were not very frequent; for it
was above fifteen months before any more of them came
on more there again; that is to fay, I never faw them, or
an y foot ft eps or fignals of them, in all that time; for as
to the rainy feafons, then they are fure not to come
abroad, atleaft not fo far; yet all this while I lived un-
comfortably, by rcafon of the conftant apprehenfions I
was in of their coming upon me by furprife; from whence
,t obferve, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than
the fufFering, efpecially if there is no room to make oil'
•that expectation or thofe apprehenfions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering humour;
and took up moil of my hours, which mould have been
better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and
fall upon them the very next time I mould fee them;
especially if they Ihould be divided, as they were the la ft
time, into two parties; nor did I conftder at all, that it
I killed one party, fuppofe ten or a dozen, I was ilill the
next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and fo
another, even ad infinitum, till I mould be at length no
lefs a murderer than they were in being men-eaters, and
perhaps much more fo.
I fpent my days now in great perplexity and anxictv
of mind, expecting that 1 mould one day or other fall
into the hands of thofe mercilefs creatures; if I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not-without looking
round me with the grcatell care and caution imagina-
ble; and now I found, to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of
goats; for I durft not, upon any account, fire my
efpecially near that fide of the ifland, where they ufually
cme*
 
 
 
came, left I fhould alarm the favages; and if they had
fled from me now, I was fare to have them come bick
a«rain, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever faw any more of the favages, and then i
found them again, as 1 mail foon ohferve. It is true-,
they might have been there once or twice, but either
they made no iiay, or, at lead, 1 did not hear them;
hut in the month of May, as near as I could calculate,
and in my four and twentieth year, I had a very ftrange
encounter with them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or
fixteen months interval, was very great; I flept unquiet,
dreamed always frightful dreams, and often ftarted out
of 171 y fleep in the night; in the day great troubles
overwhelmed my mind; in the night I dreamed often
of killing the favages, and the reafons why I might
juftify the doing of it: Eut to wave all this for a while,
it was in the middle of May, on the fixteenth day, I
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would rec-
kon; for I marked all upon the poll ftiil; I fay, it was an
the fixteenth of May, that it blew a great ftorm of wind
all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and
a very foul night was after it: I know not what was the
particular occafion of it; but as 1 was reading in the
Bible, and taken up with ferious thoughts about my pre-
sent condition, I was furprifed with the noife of a gun,
as I thought, fired at fea.
This was, to be fure, a furprife of a quite different na-
ture from any I had met with before; for the notions
this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind: I
ftarted up in the grcatelt halle imaginable ; and in a trice
chapped up my ladder to the middle place of the rock,
and pulled it after me, and mounting in the fecond time,
got to the top of the hill; that very moment a flalh of
{ire bade me Men for a fecond gun, which accordingly
m about half a moment I heard, and by the found knew
that it was from that part of the fea where I was driven
out with the current in my boat.
I immediately confidered, that this muftbe fome fhipin
diftrefs, and that they had fome comrade, or fome other
H 4 ihip
 
i;6 ..ADVENTURES OF
fhip in company, and fired thefe guns for fignals of dif
trefs, and to obtain help: I had this prefenceof m ml
at that minute, as to think, that though I could not help
them, it may be they might help me; fo I brought toge-
ther all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making
a good handfome pile, I fet it on fire upon the hill; the
wood was dry, and blazed freely, and tho* the wind blew
very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, io that 1 was certain,
if there was any fuch thing as a fhip, they mult need fee
it, and no doubt they did; for as foon as ever my fire
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that fevernl
others, all from the fame quarter, i plied my firedII
night long., till day broke; and when it was broad dav,
and the air cleared up, 1 law fomething at a great dis-
tance at lea, full call of the illand, whether a fail, or an
hull, J could not diitinguifh, no not with my glafe,
the diftanre was fo great, and the weather ft ill fome-
thing hazy alio; at Jeaft it was fo out it fea.
I looked; frequently at it all that day, and foon per-
ceived that it did not move; fo I prefently concluded,
that it was a fhip at anchor; and being eager, you may
be fare to be fatisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and
ran towards the fouth-eaftfide of the illand, to the rocks,
where I had been formerly carried away with the cur-
rent; and gett ng up there, the weather by this time
being perfectly clear, I could plainly fee, to my great for-
i ow, the wreck of a fhip call away in the night upon thole
concealed rocks which J found when I was out in my boat,*
and which rocks as they checked the violence of the
/bream, and made a kind of counter-ftream, or eddy, were
tne occaficn of my recovering then from the molt defperate
hcpelefc condition that ever 1 had been in all my lift*.
Thus, what is one man's fafety, is another 'man's
deitruclionfor it fee in?, thefe men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks be-
ing wholly under water, had been driven upon them m
rhe night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. N. h«*
Had they feen the bland, as I muft nccefiarily f ippof
they did net, they mull, as I thought, have endeavc ured
to have faved themfelves on more by the help of }^[r

wrh my thoughts: Firft I imagined, that,' upon feeing
my light, they.might have put themfelvcs into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the more; but that
the fea going very high, they might have been call
away; other times I imagined, that they migftt have loft
their boat before, as might be the cafe many ways; as
particularly-, by the breaking of the fea upon their (hip,
which many times obliges men to ftave, or take in pieces
their boat; and fometimes to throw it overboard with
their own hands: Other times I imagined, they had
fome other fhip or fhips in company, who, upon the fig-
r.als of diftrefs they had mafb, had taken them up, and
carried them off: Other whiles I fancied, they were all
gone off to fea in their boat, and being hurried away by.
trie current that I had been formerly in, were carried
cut into the great ocean, where there was nothing but
mifery and perifhing; and that perhaps they might by
this time think of ftarving, and of being in a condition
to eat one another.
As all thefe were but conjectures at heft, fo, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look upon
the inilery of the poor men> and pity them; which had
iaii this good, * elect on my fids, that it gave me more
-nd more caufe to give thanks to God, who had fo hap-
pjly and comfortably provided for me in my defolate
condition; and that of two mips companies who were-
now cait away upon tiiis part of the world, not one life
frould be fpared but mine. I learnt here again to obT
terve, that it is very rare, that the providence of God
c:-^ us into any condition of life fo low, or any mifery fo
great,but we may fee fomething or other to be thankful for,
and may fee others in worfe circumftances than our own.
Such certainly ^was the cafe of thefe men, of whom I
could not fo much as fee room to fuppofe any of thcrn were
Wd;.nothing could make it rational, fo much as to wilfi
or- expect that they did not all perifh. there, except the
poilibility only of their being taken, up by another ihip in
^OTtuany ;; And this was but mere poflibilily indeed; for
I f aw not the leaft fignai or appearance cf any fuch thing.
-1 cannot explain, by any pofP.ble energy of words,
f hat a ftrauge longing, or hankering of defire, I felt
m my foul upon "this fight; breaking out fometimes
*"H $ thus:
 
 
 
 
 
fc^us: O that there had been but one or two, nayyor but
one foul faved out of the fhip, to have efcaped to me,
that I might but have had one companion, one fellow-
creature, to have fpoken to me, and to have converted
. with! In all the time of my folitary life, I never felt fo
earned, fo ftrong a defire after the fociety of my fellow-
creatures, or fo deep a regret at the want of it,
There are fome ferret moving fprings in the affec-
tions, which, when they are fet a going by fome object
in view, or be it fome object though not in view, yet
rendered prefent to the mind by the power of imagina-
tion, that motion carries out the foul by its impetuofity
to fuch violent, eager embracings of the object, that
the abfence of it is infupportable.
Such were thefe earneft wifhings, That but one man
had been faved! O that it had been but one! I believe I
repeated the words, O that it had been but one! a thou-
sand times; and my defires were fo moved by it, that
when I fpoke the words, my hands would clinch toge-
ther, and my fingers prefs the palms of my hands, that
if I had had any foft thing in my hand, it would have
cruibed it involuntarily; and my teeth in my head
would ftrike together, and fet againft one another fo
ilrong, that for fome time I could not part them again.
, Let the naturalifts explain thefe things, and the reafon
and manner of them: All I can lay of them, is, to defer
the fact, which was ever furprifmg to me when I found it;
tho' I knew not from what it mould proceed? it was doubt -
lefs the effect of ardent wiflics, and of frrong ideas formed
iti my mind, realizing the comfort which the converfation
of one of my fellow-chriflians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or
both, forbad it; for till the laft year of my being on this
ifland, I never knew, whether any were faved out of that
jfliip or no; and had only the affliction fome days after,
to fee the corpfe of a drowned boy come on fhore, at
the end of the ifland, which was next the fhipwreck:
He had on no clothes, but a feaman's waiftcoat, a pan*
of open -kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen ihirt; but
nothing to direct me fo much as to guefs what nation he
was "of: He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of
eighi* and a tobocco-pipe; the laft was to me of tf rt
times more value than th« fir ft.
 
 
 
 
It was now calm, and 1 had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might
find fomething on board, :hat might be nfeful to me;
but that did not altogether prefs me fo much, as the pofli-
bility that there might be yet fome living creature on
board, whole life I might not only fave, but might, by
faving that life, comfort my own to the la ft degree:
And this thought clung fo to my heart, that I could not
be quiet night nor day, but I muft venture out in my
boat on board this wreck; and committing the reft to
God'b providence, I thought the impreflion was foftrOng
upon my mind, that it could not be refifted, that it muft
come from fome invifible direction, and that I fhould
be wanting to myfelf if I did not go.
Under the power of this impreflion, I haftened back
to mv caftly, prepared every thing for my voyage, took
a quantity of bread, a great pot for frefti Water, a com-
pafs to fteer by, a bottle of rum (for I had ftill a great
deal of that left) a bafket full of ratfins: And thus load-
ing m\felf with every thing neceflary, I went down to
my boat, got the water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more: My fecond cargo was a great bag full of rice,
the umbrella to fet up over my head for fliade, another
large pot full of frefh water, and about two dozen of my
fmall loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a
bottle of goat's milk, and a cheefe; all which, with great
labour and fweat, I brought to my boat; and praying
to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or
pa kiling the canoe along thefhore, I came at Jaft to the
uimoft point of the ifland, on tfrat fide; viz. N. E»
And now, I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture, or not to venture; I looked on the rapid
currents which ranconftantly on both fides of the ifland,
at a difiance, and which were very terrible to nie>
from the remembrance of the hazard J had been in be-
fore, and my heart began to fail me; for I forefaw, that
u * was driven into either of thofe currents, I fhould be
carried a vaft way out to fea, and perhaps out of my
i'each, or fight of the ifland again and that then, as
r«y boat was but fmall, if any little gale of windfhoiald
nsr, I fliculd be inevitably loft.
li 6 Thefe
 
 
 
 
 
Thefe thoughts fo opprefled my mind, that I began
to give over my cnterprife, and having haled my boar,
into a little creek on the more, I flopped out, and fat
me down upon a little fpot of rifing ground, very pen-
five and anxious, between fear and defire about my voy-
age; when as I was muling, I could perceive that the
tide was turned, and the flood came on, upon which my
'going was for fo many hours impracticable: Upon this
it prefently occurred to me, that I mould go up to the
higheft piece of ground I could find, and obfcrve, if I
could, how the fets of the tide or currents lay, when the
flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home, with the fame rapidnefs of the cur-
rents: This thought was no fooner in my head, but 1
caft my eye upon a little hill which fufhciently over-
looked the fea both ways, and from whence I had a clear
view of the currents, or fets of the tide, and which way
I was to guide myfelf in my return: Here I found, that
as the current of the ebb fet out clofe by the fouth point
of the illand, fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by
the fliore of the north-fide; and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the north of the ifland in my return, and
I mould do well enough.
Encouraged with this obfcrvation, I refolved the next
.morning to fet out with the firil of the tide; and re-
puting myfelf for that night in the canoe, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out; I made firfl a
little out to fea full north, till I began to feel the benefit
of the current, which fet eaflward, and which carried me
at a great rate, and^yet did not fo hurry me as the
fouthern fide current liad done before, and fo as to take
from me all government of the boat; but having a
ilrong fteerage with my paddle, I went, I fay, at a great
rate, directly for the wreck, and in lefs than two hours
I came up to it.
It was*a difmal fight to look at: The (hip, which by
its building was Spanifb, iluck fait, jambed in between
t\yo rocks; all the Hern and quarter of her was beaten
to pieces with the fea; and as her forecaftle which
fbruck in the rocks, had run on with great violence,
her main-mail and.fore-»jnafl were brought by the board.
 
 
 
 
that is to fay, broken fhort offo...but b.pE;bo«t>fprit>^|is
found, and the head and bow appeared firm; when I
came clofe to her, a dog appeared upon her, which, fee-?
ing me coming, yelped and cried, and as foon as I called
hi r, jumped into the fea to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, hut found him almoft dead for hun-
ger and third: I gav* him a cake of my bread, ami he
eat like a ravenous wolf that had been ftarving a fort-
night in the mow: I then gave the poor creature fome-
fieih water, with which, if I would have let him, he
would have burit himfelf.
After this I went on board ; the firft light I met with,
was two men drowned in the cock-room, or forecaftle,
of the fhip, with their arms fall about one another. I
concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the fhip
flruck, it being in a ftorm, the fea broke fo high, and
fo continually over her, that the men were not able -to
btar it, and were ftrangied with the con flan t ruming in
of the water, as rnui h as if they had been under water:
beildes the dog, there was nothing left in the fhip that
had life, nor any goods that J could fee, but what were
fpoiled by the water: there were fome calks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in
the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I
could fee ; but they were too big to meddle writh; I -law
ieveral cherts, which I believed belonged to fome of the
teamen, and I got two of them into the boat without
examining what was in them. ,
Had the ftern of the fhip been fixed, and the fore part
broken orF, I am perfuaded I might have made a good
voyage; for by what I found in thefe two chefts, 1 had
room to.fuppofe the fhip had a great deal of wealth on
hoard; and if I may guefs by thecourfe fhe fleered, fhe,
miift have been bound from the Buenos Ay res, or the
Rio de la Plata, in the South part of America, beyond?)
the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico,
and fo perhaps to Spain; fhe had, no doubt, a great trea-;
hire in her, but of no ufe at that time to any body; and
what became of the reft of her people. I then knew not. }
I found, befides thefe chefts, a little call full of li-
quor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat, with much difficulty : there wN re fevcral mufquets
m
 
 
 
 
 
in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it; as for the mufquers, I had no
occafion for them, fo I left them, hut took the powder-
horn: I took a fire-fhovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as alfo two little brafc kettles, a copper pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this cargo,
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make
home again; and the fame evening, about an hour
within night, 1 reached the iftand again, weary and
fatigued to the laft degree.
I repofed that night in the boat, and in the morning
I refolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave,
not to carry it home to my caftle: after refreihing my-
felf, I got all my cargo on more, and began to examine
the particulars: the calk of liquor I found to be a kind
of rum, but not fiich as we had at the Rrafils; and in a
word, not at all good; but when I came to open the
chefts, I found ft vera I things which I wanted: for ex-
ample, I found in one a fine cafe of bottles, of an extra-
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, aiid
very good; the bottles held about three pints* each, and
•were tipped with filver; I found two pots of very good
fuccades, or fweetmcats, fo fattened alfo on the top, that
the fait water had not hurt them; and two more of the
fame, which the water had fpoiled: I found fome very
good iliirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and an half of white linen handkerchiefs, 'and
coloured neckcloths; the former were alfo very wel-
come, being exceeding refreihing to wipe my face in an
hot day; beHdes this, when T came to the till in the
eheks, I found there three great bags of pieces of eight,
which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and m
One of them wrapt up in a paper, ftx doubloons of gold,
find fome fmall bars or wedges of gold; I fuppofe they
might all weigh near a pound.
The other cheft I found had fome clothes in it, butot
little value; but by the circumftances it muft have be-
longed to the gunner's mate, though there wasno pow-
deivin it, but about two pounds of glazed powder, in the
three ilafks, kept, I fuppofe, for charging their fr.vling-
pieces on occafion: upon the whole, 1 got very little Dy
this voyage that was of uiuch ufe to me; for, as to the
money,
 
money, I had no manner of occafion for it; it was tome
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it
all for three or four pair of Englifh fhoes andftockings,
which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on
nw feet now for many years; 1 had, indeed, gotten two-
pair of fhoes now, which 1 took off the feet of the two
drowned men, whom I faw in the wreck $ audi found
two pair more in one of the chefts, which Were very weU
come to me; but they were not like our Enlifh fhoes,
either for eafe or fervic.e, being rather what we call
pumps than fhoes: 1 found in the feaman's chefl about
fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; I fuppofe
this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which
fumed to belong to fome officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my cave,
and laid it up, as I had done that before, which 1
brought from our own fhip; but it was great pity, as I
fa id, that the other part of the fhip had not come to my
fhare, for I am fatisfied I might have loaded my canoe
feveral times over with money, which, if I had ever
ef-aped to England, would have lain here fafe enough
till I might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on fhore, and fe~
cured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or pad-
died her along the more to her old hart>our, where 1 laid
Her up, and made the belt of my way to my old habita-
tion, where I found every thing fafe and quiet; fo I be-
g^n to repofemyfelf, live after my old fafhioii, and take
tare of my family affairs; and for a while I lived eafy
enough; only that I was more vigilant than I ufed<to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad fo much;
and if at any time J did ftir with any freedom, it was
always to the eaft part of the iQand, where I was pretty
well fatisfied the favages never came, and where I could
K° without fo many precautions, and filch a load of
arms and ammunition, as I always carried with me, if I
went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but
nlV unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was horn to make my body miferable, was all thofe two
># ars filled with projects and defigns, how, if it were
pollibk, I might get away from this ifland; for fome-
times
 
 
 
 
times I was for making another voyage to the wreck,
though my reafon told me that there was nothing left
there worth the hazard of my voyage : fometimes for a
ramble one way, fometimes another: and I believe ve-
rily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I
mould have ventured to fea, bound any where, I knew
not whither.
I have been, in all my circumfrances, a memento to
thofe who are touched with that general, plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught 1 know, one half of their mise-
ries flow; I mean, that of not being Satisfied with the Na-
tion wherein God and nature hath placed them; for, not
to look back upon my primitive condition, and the ex-
cellent advice of -ny father, the oppofitionto which was,
as I may call it, my original fin, my fubfequent miflakes
of the fame kind have been the means of my coming in-
to this miferabie condition; for had that Providence,
which fo happily had feated me at the Brazils as a plant-
er, blefled me with confined defires, and could I have
been contented to have g. ne on gradually, I might have
been by this time, I mean in the time of my being on
this ifland, one of the mofl comfortable planters in the
Brazils; nay, I am pcrfuaded, that by the improvements
I had made in that little time I lived there, and the in-
creafe I fhculd probably have made, if I had flayed, 1
might have been worth anhundred thoufand moidores,
and what bufinefs had I to leave a fettled fortune, well-
1to:ked plantation, improving and increafimr, to turn <u-
percarpo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patience and
time would have fo increafed our flock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own doors, from thofe
whole bufinefs it was to fetch them; And though it had
coll us Something more, yet the difference of that price
wa> by no means worth Saving at So great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarik the fate of young he; ds, fo re-
fxftion upon the folly of it, Is as ordinarily the exercife
cf more years, or of the dear-bought experience of time i
and fo it was with me now ;* and yet So deep had thernii-
take taken root in my temper, that I could not Satisfy
myfelf in my flat ion, but was continually poring u].on
the means and poihbility of my efcape from this place;
and that I may, with the greater pleafure to the reader
bring
 
 
bring on the remaining part of my (lory, i* may not be*
improper to give fome account of my firft conceptions on
tht fubj( £t of this foolifii fcheme for my euape; arid
how, and upon-what foundation, I acled.
I am now to be fuppoftd to be retired into mycaflle,
after my late voyage to the wre k, my frigate laid up,
aid fern red under water as utVd, and my condition re-
ftored to \\ h- t it was before; I had more wealth, in-
deed than I had before but was not at aH the richer r
for I had no more ufc for it than the Irdhns of Peru*
had before: the Snama.^s cr.me thither. ''•
It was one of the nt edits, in the mn'y feafon in March,*
the four 2nd twentieth year of mv frit ft trine; foot in this'
ill?.nd of K Lvcr, "1 was Iv'ng in my bed or ham-:*'
n.ofk awake, and verv well in health, had no pain, no
dift.rnper. w- a!v;-"f:ne{s of body, no, nor any un'ioCintfc.
of mind nioic tLz.ii ordinary, but could by no means
clofe my eyes; that is, fo as to deep-; no, not a vvinfc
all night long, otherwise than as follow:
It is as impoffible as needlcfs, to fet down the innu-
merable croud of thoughts that whirled through that
gnat thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this
eight's time: I ran over the whole hiftory of my life*
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my
coming to this bland; and alfo of that part of my life
fnice I came to this ifland; in my reflection's upon, the
ftate of my cafe, fince I came on "more on this ifland
I was comparing the happy pofture of affairs, ire
the firft years of my habitation here, to that courfe of
anxiety, fear and care, whi:h I had lived in ever fincc
1 had feen the print of afoot in the fand; not that I did
not believe the favages had frequented the ifland even:
ail the while, and might have been feveral hundreds of
fte'-m at times on ftiore there ; but as I had ever known
and was incapable of any apprehenfions about it,
n\V faiisf ftion was perfect, though my danger was the
1 !;r ^; and I was as happy in not knowing my dangery
a; !t I had never really been expoled to it; thus fur-
niflied my thoughts with many very profitable reflec-
t-^'i-s, and particuiaily this one, How infinitely good
ta/*t Providence is, which has fettled in its government
°* Unkind, fuch narrow bounds to his fight and know-
ledge
 
 
ledge of things; and though he walks in the midft of fo
many thoufand dangers, the fight of which, if difcovered
to him, would diftracl his mind, and fink his fpirits, lie
is kept ferene and calm, by having the events of things
hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangeis
which furroimd him.
After thefe thoughts had for fome time entertained me,
I came to refitcl ferioufly upon the real danger I had
been in for fo many years in this very ifland; and hovv
I had walked about in the greateft fecurity, and with
all poffible tranquility, even perhaps when nothing but
a brow of an hill, a great tree, or the cafual approach of
night, had been between me and the wodl kind of dc-
jfti ucltion; viz. that of falling into the hands of canibals
and favages, who would have feized on me with the
fame view as I did on a goat "or a turtle, and have
thought it no more crime to kill and devour me, than
I did of a pigeon or a curlieu; I fhould unjuftly ilander
myfelf, if I mould fay I was not (incerely thankful to my
great Preferver, to whofe Angular protection I acknow-
ledged, with great humility, that all thefe unknown de-
liverances were due, and without which I fhould inevi-
tably have fallen into their mercilefs hands.
When thefe thoughts were over, my head was for
fome time taken up in confidering the nature of thefe
wretched creatures, I mean the favages; and how it
came to pafs in the world, that the wife governor of all
things fhould give up any of his creatures to fuch inhu-
manity, nay, to fomething fo much below even brutality
itfelf, as to devour its own kind; but at this ended in
fome (at that time fruitlels) fpeculations, it occurred to
me to inquire what part of the world thefe wretches
lived in; how far off the coaft was from whence they
came; what they ventured fo far from home for; what
kind of boats they had; and why I might not order my-
felf, and my bufmefs fo, that 1 might be as able to go
ever thither, as they were to come to me.
I never fo much as troubled my fell to confider, what 1
fhould do with myfelf when I came thither, what mould
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the favages; or
how I fhould efcape from them, if they attempted me;
no, nor fo much as how it was poflible for me to reach the
coa&
 
 
 
 
 
foalt, and not be attacked by fo ne or other of them,
without any poilibility of deli vering myfelf; and iflfhould
not fail into then hand.-, what I fhould do for provifjon, or
whither I mould bend my courie; none of thefe thoughts,
I fay, fo much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bend upon the notion of my palling over in my
boat tathe main land: I looked back upon my pre fen t
condition as the moft miferable that could pofubly be*;
that I wjs not able to throw myfelf into any thing but
death that could be called worfe; that if I reached the
fhore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with relief *;
or I might coaft along, as I did on the fhore of Africa,
till I came to fome inhabited country, and where I
might find fome Chriftian fhip that might take me in;
and lithe woritcame to the worfl, I could but die, Which
would put an end to all thefe miferies at once. Pray,
note, all this was the fruit of a difturbed mind, an im-
ptienat temper, made, as it were, dtfperate by the long
continuance of my troubles, and the difappointments I
had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and where
I had been fo near the obtaining of what I fo earneftly
longed for, viz. fomebody to fpeak to, and to learn
fome knowledge from, of the place where I was, and of
the probable means of my deliverance: I fay, I was
agitated wholly by thefe thoughts. All my calm of
mind in my refignation to Providence, and waiting the
iflue of the'difpofitions of heaven, feemed to be fufpend-
ed; and I had, as it were, "no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but the project of a voyage to the main,
which came upon me with fuch force, and fuch an im-
petuofitv of defire, that it was not to be refitted.
When this; had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with fuch* violence, that it fet my very blood
into a ferment, and my pulfe beat as high as if I had
b°en in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer-
vour of my mind about it: nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhaufted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a found deep: one would have thought
I fliould have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any
thing relating to it; but I dreamed, that as I was going
out in the morning, as ufual, from my cattle, I faw
^ upon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
upon the Chore two canoes, and eleven favages coming to
land, and that they brought with them another favagc,
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him; when
ion a fadden, the fivage that they were going to kill jump-
ed away, and ran for his life ; then I thought in ray Jflccp,
that .he came running into my little thick grove, be fere
my fortification, to hide himfelf; and that J feeing him
alone, and not perceiving that the others fought him that
way, f he wed myfeif to him, andfmiiing upon him tncou-
raged him: that he kneeled down to me, feeming to
pray me to aflat him; upon which 1 (hewed my hc&cr,
made him go up it, and carried him into my cave, ard'
he became my fervant; and that as foon as I had gotten
this man, i faid to rnyfelf, now I may certainly venture
to., the main hind; for this fellow will fcrv-c me a-a
pilot, and wiii tell nic what to do, and whither to, go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear cfbeing devour-
ed, what places to venture mte> and what to cfcape. I
waked with this thought, and was under fuch inexprefi-
ble impxemons of joy at the profpect of my cfcape in
my dream, that the difappointments which 1 felt upon
coming to rnyfelf, and finding it was no more than a
dream,, were equally extravagant the other way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of fbifit.
Upon .this, however, I made this conclufion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an efcape, v as,
if pomble, to get a lavage in my pofMion; and, if
po&ble, it mould be one of their prifoners whom they
had condemned to be eaten, and mould bring hither to
kill; but thefe thoughts ftill were attended with this
difficulty, that it was impomblc io effect this, without
attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them ail;
and this waa net only a very defperatc attempt, and
might mifcarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
fcrupled the lawfulnefs of it to me, and my heart trem-
bled at the thoughts of ihedding fo much blood, ?ho'
it was for my deliverance; 1 need not repeat the argu-
ments: which occurred to me again It thh, they being the
lame mentioned before: but though I had other reafos
to^ offer now; viz. that thole men were enemies to my
life, and would devour me, if they could; that itv -c
feif-prefervatien in the higher! degree, to deliver mvfclt
(rem
 
 
from this death of a life, and was ading in my own
defence, as much as if they were actually aiTaulting me,
and the like; I fay, though then: things argued for it,
yet the thoughts of (bedding human "blood for my de-
liverance were very terrible to me, and fuch as 1 could
by no means reconcile myfclf to a great while.
{lev/ever, at laft, after many fecret difputes with myCdC,
and after great perplexities about it (for all thefe argu-
ments, one way and another, ltruggled in my head a long
time) the eager prevailing deiire of deliverance at length
mattered all the reft, and i refolvcd, if potable, to get one
of thefe favages into my hands, coft what it would: my
next things then was to contrive how to do it; and this in-
deed was very difficult to refolve on : but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, fo I refolvcd to put myfeif
upon the watch to fee them when they came on ihore, and
leave the reft to the event, taking fuch meafures as the
opportunity mould prefent, let it be what it would.
With thefe refolutions in my thoughts, I fet myCdC
upon the fcout as often as poiTible, and indeed fo often,
t.'ii I was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year
and an half that I waited, and for a great part ^of that
time went out to the welt end, and to the fouth-welt
corner of the ifiand, almoft every day to fee the canoe?,
irJt nons appeared: this was very difcouraging, and be-
gan to trouble me much; tho* i can't fay that it did in
tnii cafe as it had done feme time before that; viz.
^'tar oi? the edge of my deiire to the thing; but the
longer it feemed to be delayed, the more eager I was
ixf iv: in a word, I was not at iirir. more careful to fhun
tne fight of thefe favages, and avoid being feen by
t u'jn, than I was now eager to be upon them.
Befuics, 1 fancied myfeif able to manage one, nay, two
o~ three favages, if I had them, Co as to make them en-
tirely Haves to me, to do whatever I mould direct them,
;in'^ tG prevent their being able, at any time, to do me
any hurt: it was a geat while that I pleafed myfeif
*'^h this affair, but nothing ftill prefentcd; all' my
fancies and fchernes carae to nothing, for no favages
came near me for a great while.
About a year and an half after I had entertained thefe
^jtions, and, by long mufiag, had, as it were, refolvcd
them
 
 
 
 
 
 
them all into nothing, for want of an occaiion to put
them in execution, I was furprifed one morning early ,
with feeing no lelsthan five canoes all on (hore together,
on my fide the ifland, and the people who belonged to
them all landed, and out of my light: the number of
them broke all my meafurcs; for feeing fo many, and
knowing that they always came four, or fix, or fomc-
times more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my meafures to attack twenty or thirty
men fmgie-handed; fo I lay (till in my caille, perplexed
and difcomforted; however, I put myfelf into all the
fame poftures for an attack, that I had formerly provided,
and was juft ready for action, if any thing had prefented;
having waited a good while, liflening to hear if they
made any noife, at length being very impatient, I fet my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the
top of the hill by my two ftages, as ufual; (landing fo
however, that my head did not appear above the hill;
fo that they could not perceive me by any means; here
I obferved, by the help of my perfpective-gkfs, that they
were no lefs than thirty in number, that they had a fire
kindled, and that they had had meat drafted; how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they
were all dancing in I knew not how many barbarous
gefhires and figures, their own way, round the fire.
When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by
my perfpe&ive two miferable wretches dragged from the
boats, where, it feems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the (laughter: I perceived one of them
immediately fall, being knocked down, I fuppofe, with
a club or wooden fword, for that was their way; and
two or three others were at work immediately, cutting
him open for their cookery while the other vi&im was
left (binding by himfelf, till they (hould be ready for him:
in that very moment this poor wretch feeing himfelf a
little at liberty, nature infpired him with hopes of lift*
and he darted away from them, and ran with incredible
fwiftnefs aloug the finds, direclly towards me, I mean
towards that part of the coaft where my habitation was,
I was dreadfully frighted (that I mud acknowledge)
when I perceived him to run my way; and efpecially
when, as I thought, I faw him pumied by the whole
body;
 
 
body; and now I expe£ted that part of my dream was
coming to pafs, and that he would certainly take fhelter
in mv grove; but I could not depend, by any means,
upon my dream for the reft of it, viz. that the other fa-
vages would not purfue him thither, and find him there:
However, I kept my ftation, and my fpirits began to re*
cover, when I found that there were not above three
men that followed him; and ftill more was I encou-
raged, when I found that he outftript them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them, fo that if he
rovild but hold it for half an hour, I faw eafily he would
fairly get away from them ail.
There was between them and my caftle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the firft part of my ftory,
where I landed my cargoes out of the fkip; and this I
knew, he muft neceflarily fwim over, or the poor wretch
would be taken there: But when the favage efcaping
came thither, he made nothing of it, tho* the tide wa^s
then up; but plunging in, fwam thro' in about thirty
m okes, or thereabouts landed, and ran on with exceed-
ing ftrength and fwiftnefs; when the three purfuers
came to the creek, I found that two of them could fwim,
but the third could not, and that he ftanding on the
other fide, looked at the other, but went no farther;
and foon after went loftiy hack again, which, as it hap-
pened, was very well for him in the main .
I obferved that the two whom fwam, were yet more
than twice as long fwimming over the creek, than the
fellow was that fled from them: It came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irrefiftiby, that
now was my time to get me a fervant, and per hap a
companion, or afiiftant, and that I was called plainly
hy Providence to fave this poor creature's life: I im-
mediately got down the ladders with all pofuble expe-
dition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the
foot of the ladder, as I obferved above; and getting
"P again with the fame hade to the top of the hill,
1 croned towards the fea ; and, having a very fhort cut,
and all down-hill, clapped myfeif in the way between
the purfuers and the purfued, hallooing aloud to him
that fled, who, looking back, was at firft perhaps as
^uch frighted at me as at them; but I beckoned with
my
 
 
my hand to him to come back, and in the mean time, I
flowly advanced towards the two that followed; then Turn-
ing at once upon the foremoft, 1 knocked him down with
the llock of my place ; I was loth to fire, becaufe I would
not have the re it hear; tho' at that dillance it would not
have been eafily heard; and being out of fight of the
fmoke too, they would not have eafily known what to
make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other
who purfued him Hopped, as if he had been frightened,
and I advanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer
I perceived prefently he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it to moot at me; fo I was then necefhtated to
fhoot at him first ; which I did, and killed him at the Mil
{hot. The poor favage who fled, but had flopped, tho1.
he faw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought)
yet was fo frighted with the hre and noife of my peace,
that he flood llock-fiill, and neither came forward, nor
went backward, tho* he feemed rather inclined to fly ftill,
than to coi;*e on. 1 hallooed again to him, and made figns
to come forward, which he eaffiy underflocd, and cr.rre
a little way, then Hopped again, and then a little farther,
and flopped again, and I could then perceive that he flood
trembling, as if he had been taken prifoner, and had juil
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned
him again to come to me, and gave him all the figns of
encouragement, that I could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve fleps in
token of acknowledgment for faving his life. 1 fmiled
at him, and looked pieafantly, and beckoned to him to
come flill nearer. At length he came clefe to me, and
then he kneeled down again, killed the ground, and laid
. liis head upon the ground, and taking me by.the foot,
fet my foot upon his bead; This, it feems, was in token
of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all 1
cculd. But there was more work to do yet: for I per-
ceived the favage, whom I knocked down, was not killed,
but flunned with the blow, and began to come to him-
felf: So I pointed to him and mewed him the favage, that
he was not dead, upon this he fpoke feme words to me;
and tho' I could not under/land them, yet I thought
they were pleafant to hear, for they were the firfl found

of a man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for
above five and twenty years: but there was no time for
fuch reflections now; the favage, who was knocked
down, recovered himfelf fo far, as to fit upon the
ground; and I perceived that my favage began to be
afraid; but when I faw that, I prefented my other piece
at the man, as if I would moot him; upon this my fa-
vage, for fo I rail him *vw, made a motion to me to
lend him my fword, which hung naked in a belt by my
fide; fo I did: he no fooner had it, but he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as cleverly, no
executioner in Germany could have done it fooner or bet-
ter; which I thought it very ftrange for one, who, I had
reafon to believe, never faw a fword in his life before,
except their own w ooden fwords; however, it feems, as
1 learned afterwards, they made their wooden fword s fo
lharp, fo heavy, and the wood is fo hard, that they will
cut off heads even with them, ay, and arms, and that at
one blow too. When he had done this, he eornesfaugh-
ingtome in fign of triumph, and brought me the fword
again, and with abundance of geftures, which I did not
underftanri, laid it down with the head of the favage that
he had killed, juil before me.
But that which adonimed him moft was, to know how
I had killed t*ieother Indian fo far off; fo pointing to him,
he made figns to me to let him go to him; fo I bade him
sro, as well as I could; whence came to him, be flood

made, which it feems wasjuft in Lis breaft where it hr.d
niade an hole, and no great quantity of blood had fol-

ried them both in a quarter of an hour; then calling
him away, I carried him not to my calHe, but quite away
to my cave, on the farther part of the ifland; fo 1 did
not let my dream come to pafs in that part, viz. that he
came into my grove for fheker.
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raifms to eat,
and a draught of water, which * found he was indeed in
great diftreis for, by his runni ;and having refrefhed
him, I made figns for him to go lie down and fleep,
pointing to a place where I had laid a great parcel of rice
ilraw, and a blanket upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon
myfelf fometimes; fo the poor creature lay down, and
went to fleep. >
He was a comely handfome fellow, perfectly well made,
with ikaight long limbs, not too large, tall, and well-*
lhaped, and, as I reckon, abount twenty-fix years of age.
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and furly
afpecl, but feemed to have fomething very manly in hU
face, *nd yet he had all the fweetnefs and fbftnefs of an
European in his countenance too, efpecially when he
fmiled: his hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large, and a great
vivacity and fparkling fharpnefs in his eyes. The colour
of his fkin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet
not of an ugly yellow naufeous tawny, as the Brafiliafis,
and Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it fome-
thing very agreeable, tho* not very eafy to defcribe. Hi'
face was round and plump, his nofe fmall, not flat like
the negroes, a very good mouth, thm lips, and his teeth
fine, weil-fet, and white as ivory. After he had {lumber-
ed, rather than llept, about half an hour, he waked again,
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been milking
my goats, which I had in the inclofure jufi by; when
he efpied me, he came running to me, laying hirafcif
down again upon the ground, with all the pofiible lign*
of an humble thankful difpofition, making many anticK
geflures to mew it. At laft he lays his head flat upon the
ground, clofe to my foot, and fets his other foot upon &s
head, as he done before; and after this, made all tne
figns to me of fubjc&km, fervitude, and fubmifTKm imng*-
, liable to let me know how much lie would ferve me #
 
ong as he lived: I underftood him in many things, and
let him know I was very well pleafed with him*; in a
little time I began to fpeak to him, and teach him to
ipeak to me; and firft, I made him know his name mould
be Friday, which was the day I faved his life; and I
called him for the memory of the time ; I like wife taught
him to fay mailer, and then let him know that was to be
my name ; I likevvife taught him to fay Yes and No, and
to know the meaning of them; I gave him fome milk in
an earthen pot, and let him fee me drink it before him,
and fop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake of bread
t o do (he like, which he quickly complied with, and made
%ns that it was very good for him.
1 kept there with him all that night, but as foon as it
v. a> day, I beckoned on him to come with me, and let him
know I would give him fome clothes, at which he feemed
very glad, for he was Mark-naked. As we went by the
J lace where we had buried the two men, he pointed ex-
^vtly to the fpot, and mewed me the marks tha*- he had
made to find them again, making figns to me that we
fnould dig them up again, and eat them; at this I ap-
peared very angry, expreffed my abhorrence of it, made
**$ if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to Mm to come away, which he did im-
mediately, with great fubmiffion: I then led him up to
the top of the hill, to fee if his enemies were gone, and
pulling out my glafs, 1 looked, and faw plainly the place
*"fiere they had been, but no appearance of them, or of
tfieir canoes $ fo that it v/as plain that they were gone,
and had left'their comrades behind them, without any
iearch after them.
But 1 was not content with this difcovery, but hav-
ln& now more courage, and confequently more curiofity,
* .t0°k my man Friday with me, giving him the fword in
«;s hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I
found he could ufe very dexteroufly, making him carry
0ne Spn for me, and I two for myfelf, and away we
marched to the place where thefe creatures had been;
*?r * ^d a mind now to get fome fuller intelligence of
tfiem: when I came to the place, my very blood ran
tftiH in my viens, and my heart fuck within me at the
norror of the fpeetacle; indeed it was a, dreadful fight,
i £
 
 
atleaft it wasfo to me, though Friday made nothing of
it: the place was covered with human 1x>nes, the ground
dyed with the Hood, great pieces of fkih left here and
there, half-eaten, mangled, and fcorched; and in fhort,
all the tokens of the triumphant feaft they had been
making there, after a victory over their enemies: I faw
three mulls, five hands, and the hones of three or four
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bo-
dies; and Friday, by hisiigns, made me underftand, that
they brought over four prisoners to feaft upon; that three
of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himfelf,
was the fourth; that there had been a great buttle be-
tween them and their next king, whofe fubjecls, it
feems, he had been one of; and that they had taken a
great number of priToners, all which were carried to
feveral places by thofe that had taken them in the flight,
in order to feaft upon them, as was done here by thefe
wretches upon thofe they brought hither,
I cnufcd Friday to gather all the jfkulls, bones, flefb,
and whatever remained, and lay .he.ii together on an
heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn them all
to allies: I found Friday had ftill an hankering ftomach
after fome of the flefb, and was ftill a canibal in his na-
ture; but I difeovered fo much abhorrence at the very
thoughts of it, and at the leaft appearance of it, that he
dtirft notdifcover it; for I had, by fome means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to ourcaftle,
and there I fell to work for my man Friday; and flrft of all,
I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the
poor gunner's cheft I mentioned, and which I found m
the wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him
very well; then I made him a jerkin of goat's fkin, aswell
as my (kill would allow, and I was now grown a tolera-
ble good taylor; and I gave him a cap, which 1 had
made of an hare-fkin, very convenient, and fafhionahle
enough: and thus lie was drefted, for the prefent, tolera-
bly well, and mighty well was he pkafed to fee hiiiifelf
almoft as well clothed as his mafter: it is true he went
aukwardly in thefe things at firft; wearing the drawers
was very auk ward to him, and the fleeves of the waift ozt
galledhisShoulders, and the inftdeof his arms; but a little
e?.fTng
 
 
frdiris; them, where he complained they hurt him, and
umg hi rrneif to them, at length he took to them very well.
l he next day after I came home to my hutch with
him, I began to confider where I ihould lodge him; and
that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly eafy.
mvfelf, 1 made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the infide of the Lift,
and in the out fide of the firfl: And as there was a door
or entrance there into my cave, 1 made a formal framed
ooor-CMle, and a door to it of boards, and fet it up ia
the paflage, a little within the entrance; and caufing the
door to open on the infide, I barred it up in the night*
taking in. my ladders too; fo that Friday could no way
ionic at me in the infide of my innermoft wail, without
mdung fo much noife in getting over, that it mult needs
i.waken me; for my firit wall had now a complete roof
over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning
up to the fide of the hill, which was again laid crofs with
lmall flicks inftead of laths* and then thatched aver $
great thicknefs with the rice flraw, which was ftron^
like reeds; and at the hole 5r place which was left to
go in or out by the ladder,, I had placed a kind of trap
rfoor, which if it had been attempted on the outfide,
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen
down, and made a great noife; and as to weapons, I
took them all in to my fide every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never
r«nri had a more faithful, loving, fincere fervmit than
Friday was to me; without paflions, fullrrmefs, or de-
hgns; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very affec-
tions were tied to me, like thofe of a child to a father;
nnd I dare lay, he would have larrifked his life for the
faving mine, upon any occafion whatfoever: the many
ttftimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt;
and foon convinced me, that I needed to ufe no precau-
tions as to my fafety on his account.
This frequently gave me occafion to obferve, and that
with wonder, that, however it had pleafed God in his
providence, and in the government of the works of his
hands, to take from fo great a part of the world of his
features, the beft ufes to which their faculties, and the
powers of their fouls, are adapted; yet that he has be-
I 3 flowed
 
flowed upon them the fame powers, the fame reafon, the
fame affections, the fame fentiments of kindnefs and
obligation, the fame pafhons and refentments of wrongs,
the fc.me fenfe of gratitude, fincerity, fidelity, and all
the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that when he pleifes to offer
them occafions of exerting thefe, they are as ready, nay ,
mere ready to apply thtm to the right uies for which
they were beftowed, than we are. And this made me
very melancholy forr.etimes, in reflecting, as the feveral
occafions prefentcd, how mean an ufc we make of a!i
thefe, even though we have thefe powers, enlightened by
the great lamp of i nil ruction, the fpmt of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, added to our understanding;
and v\;hy it has pleafcd God to hide the like faving know-
ledge from fo many millions of fouls, who, if i might
judge by this poor lavage, would make a much better
ufc of it than we did.
Pr;v«i kT.ce I fometimes was led too far to invade the
fovereignty of providence; raid, as it were, arraign the
juftice of fo arbitrary a difpofition of things, that mould
hide that light fr?m'forne, and reveal it to others, and
yet expect a like duty from both: but I fhut it up, and
checked my thoughts with this conclufion: Firft, that
we do not know by what light and law thefe mould be
condemned; but that, as God was neceflarily, and by *.he
nature of his being, infinitely holy and juft, fo it could
not be, but that if thefe creatures were all fentenced to
abfence from himfelf, it was on account of finning againit
that light, which, as the fcripture fays, was a law to
themfclves, and by fuch rules as their confeiences would
acknowledge tobejuft, though the foundation was not
difcoveredlo us: And, fecondly, that Mill, as we arc nil
Clay in the hand of the potter^ no veffel could fay to
him, Why haft thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion: I was great!v
delighted with him, and made it my bufinefs to teacii
him every thing that was proper to make him ufefuh
handy, and helpful; but efpecially to make him fpeak,
and underftand me when I fpake; and he was the aptelt
fcholar that ever was; and particularly was fo merry?
io conitantly diligent, and fo pleated when he could but
underftand
 
underhand ines or make me underhand him, that it was
very pleafart to me to talk to him; and now my life
began to be lb eafy, that I began to fay to myfelf, that
could I but have been fare from more ravages, I cared not
it I was never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I bad been two or three days returned to my caf-
tle, 1 thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from his
horrid way of feeding, and from the rcHfh of a canibaps
ftomach, 1 ought to let iiim tafte other flcfh; fo I took
him out wkn me one morning to the woods; I went, in-
deed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it heme and drefs it: But as I was going, I faw a
me-goat lying down in the made, and two young kids
fitting by her: I catched hold of Friday, Hold, laid I,
Hand itili; and made Jigns to him not to itir; immediately
I prefented my piece, mot and killed one of the kids. The
poor creature, who had at a diftancc, indeed, feen me kill
the favage, his enemy, but did not know, or could ima-
gine, how it was done, was fenfibly farprifed, trembled
and fhook, and looked fo amazed, that J thought he
would have funk down; He did not fee the kid I had
mot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waift-
coat to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found, pre-
sently thought I was refolved to kill him ; for he came and
kneeled down to me, and, embracing my knees, faid a
great many things 1 did not underftand, but 1 could eafily
fee, that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I foon found a way to convince him, that I would do
him no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed
at him, and, pointing to the kid which I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did; and
while he was wondering and looking to fee how the
creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by-and
by I faw a great fowl, like and hawk, fit upon a tree with-
in fhot; fo,to let Friday understand a little what I would
do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it. had been art
hawk ; I fay, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and
to the ground under the parrot, to let him fee I would
wake him fall, I made him underftand that I would (hoot
and kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bid him look,
and immediately he faw the - parrot fall: He flood like
I 4 one
 
one frighted again, notwithftanding all that I had fatd
to him; and I found he was the more amazed, becaufe
he did not fee me put any thing into the gun; but thought
there mi;ft he feme wonderful fund of death and deihur-
tion in that thing, able to kill man, beaft, bird, or any
thing near or far eff; for the aftonifhrrent thisci eated in
him, was fuch, as could not wear off for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have*
worftiipped me and my gun; as for the gun itfelf, he
would not fo much as touch it for fevera! daw. after $ but
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it hail anfwered
him, when he was by himfelf; which, as I afterwards
learned of h;m, was to defire it not to kill him.
Well: after his aftouifhment was a little over at this,
I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had mot,
which he did, but ftiid fome time; for the parrot, not
being quite dead, was fluttered a good way off from the
place where ihe fell; however he found her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and, as I had perceived his ig-
norance about the gun before, I took this advantage t)
charge the gun again, and not let him fee me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might prefent;
but nothing more offered at that time; fo I brought home
the kid; and the fame evening I took the (kin off, and
cut it out as well as I could, and having a pot for that
purpofe, I boiled or ftewed fome of the ftefh, and made
£ me very good broth ,* after I had begun to cat fome, I
gave feme to my man, who feemed very glad of it, and
liked it very well; but that which was ftrangeft to him,
was t(> fee me eat fait with it. He made a fign to me,
that the fait was not good to eat, and putting a little into
his own mouth, he feemed to naufeato it, and would fpit
and fputter at it, wafiling his mouth with frefli water after
it; on the other hand, I took fome meat in my mouth
without fait, and I pretended to fpit and fputter for want
of fait, as fa ft as he had done at the fait; but it would
not do, he would never care for fait with meat, or in ht>
broth; at leaft, not a great while, and then but a very
little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I
was refolved to feaft him the next day with roafting a
piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before the
 
 
fire in a firing, as I had feen many people do in Eng-
land, fetting two poles up, one on each fide the fire,
and one crofs on the top, and t; ing the firing to the crofs
ftick, letting the meat turn continually: this Friday
admired very much ; but when he came to tafte the flelh,
he took fo many ways to tell me how well he liked it*
that I could not but imdei ftand him: and at laft he told
me he would never eat man's ffcfli any more, which I
was very glad to hear.
The next day I fet him to work to beating Tome corn
out, and fitting it in the manner I ufed to do, as I ob-
ferved before; and he foon undeiflood how to do it as
well as I, efpecially after he had feen what the meaning
of it was. and that it was to make bread of; for after
that I let him fee me make my bread, and bake it too;
and in a little time Friday was able to do. all the work
for me, as well as I could do it myfelf*
I began now to confkiei> that having twTo mouths to>
feed inftead of one, I muff provide more ground for my
harveft, and plant a larger quantity of corn, than I ufed
to do; fo I marked out a larger piece of land, and began
the fence in the fame manner as before, in which Friday
not only worked very willing! \v and very hard, but did
it very chearfuliy; and I told him what it was for, thar
it was for corn to make more bread, became he was now
with me, and that I might have enough for him and my-
felf too: he appeared very fenfible of that part, and let
me know, thai he thought ! had much m^*e labour upon
me on his account, than I had for my felf, and that he.
would woik the harder for me, if I would teli him what
to do.
This was the pleafanteft year of ail the Irk. I led in tins
pi 1 :e: Friday began to talk pretty well, and under (land
the names of almof£ every tiling I md occafion to call
lor, and of every place I had to tend him to, and talk a
g' eat deal to trie ; fo that,, in more, I heg.j.n now, to have
fo.me uf- f~r my-tongue again, which indeed I had very
little occahon lor before; that is to fay, about fpeeeh;
befides the pleafure of talking to him, I had a lingular
fatisfa&ion in the fe!e v himfelf j his Ample unfeignei
honefty appeared to me more and more every day, and I
began, really to love the creature; and on his fije, 1
 
 
 
believe he loved me more than it was poflible for him
ever to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering incli-
nation to his own country again; and having learned him
Englifh fo welt, that he could anfwer me almoft any ques-
tion; I afked him, whether the nation that he belonged
to never conquered in battle. At which he fmiled, and
faid, Yes, yes, we always right the better; that is, he
meant, always get the better in fight, and fo we began
the following difcourfe. You always fight the better 1
laid I; How come you to be taken prifoner then, Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Mailer. How beat; if your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation
over-beat them in yonder place, where me no was;
there my nation take one, two, great thoufand.
Ma iter. But why did not your fide recover you from
the hands of yoar enemies then;
Friday. They run one, two, three,, and me, and make
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
v Matter. Weil, Friday, and what docs your nation do
with the men they t:\ke? Do they carry them away, and
«ftt them as thefe did?
Friday Yes my nation eat mens too, eat all up-
Matter. Where do they carry them?
* Friday. Go to other place where they think.
* Matter. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other place-
Matter. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [Points 10 the N. W. fide
of the iftand,. which, it feems, was tk, ..r fide].
By this Iunderftood, that my man Friday '^d formerly-
been among the favages, who ufed to corr ?n ftiore on the
farther part of the ifland, on the faid inen>v .\dnguccafion*
that he was h*w brought for; and fome ti:; e after, when
I took the courage tcTcarry- him to- that il.ie, being the
fame I formerly mentioned, he perfectly k:i* v the place,
and told me> he was there once when they eat up twenty
men, two women, and tme child. He could nzt tell twenty
in Englim, but he numbered them by laying fo many
ftoocs in a rev/, and pointing to me to tell them over. 1
 
 
 
I have told this paflage, becaufe it introduces what fol-
lows ; that after I had had this difcourfe with him, I afked
him, how far it was from our ifland to the fhore, and
whether the canoes were not often loft: He told me there
was no danger, no canoes ever loft; but that after a little
way out to fea, there was a current, and a wind always
one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.
This I underftand to be no more than the fets of the
tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards un-
der ilood it was occafioned by the great draught and re-
flux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the mouth of
which river, as I thought afterwards, our ifland lay;,
and that this land, which I perceived to the W. and.
N. W. was the great ifland Trinidad, on the north,
point of the mouth of the river: I afked Friday a. thou-
land queftiors about the country, the inhabitants, the
fea, the coait, and what nations were near; he told;
me all he knew, with the greater! oppennefs ixnmagin-
abk; 1 afked him the names of the feveral nations of his.
fort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence I eafily understood, that thefe were the
Caribecs, which our maps place on that par?* of Ame-
rica which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroono-
que to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha: he told me,
that up a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond
the fetting of the moon, which muft be W. from their
country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and"
pointed to ray great whifkers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans, that was his word;
by which I underftood he meant the Spaniards, whofe
cruelties in America had been fpread over the whole*
countries, and were remembered by all the: nations from,
father to fon.
i enquired if he could tell me how I might come from
tins ifland, and get among thofe white m«n; he told me,
i es, yes, 1 might go in two canoe; I could not under-
ftand what he*" meant by two canoe; till at laft, 'with
?jeat difficulty. I found'he meant, that it mult be in a
Urgc great boat as big as two canoes,.
This part ejf Friday's difcourfe began to reliih with,
me very well; and from this time entertained foxne.
-l0PC3» that one time or other I "might find .an opportu-
16 aitjr
 
 
 
 
nity to make my tfcape from this place, and that this
poor favage m:ght be a means to help me to do it.
During the Jong time that Friday had now been with
me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and underftand
me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious
knowledge in his mind; particularly, I afked him one
time, who made him? The poor creature did not un-
deiftand meat all, .but thought I had afked who was his
father: but I took it by another handle, and afked him
who made the fea, the ground he . walked on, and the
hills and woods? He told me, it was one old Eenamuckee
that lived beyond all: he could defcribe nothing of this
great perfon, but that he was very old; much older, he
faid, than the fea or the land, than the moon or the
fiars: I a Iked him then, if this old perfon had made ail
things why did not all things worfhip him? He looked
very grave, and with a pei kfi look of innocence faid,
All things faid O to him; I afked him, if the people who>
die in his country, went away any-where: he faid, yes,
they all went to ^enamuckee: then I afked him. Whe-
ther thofe they eat up went thither too r He faid, Yes.
Fromthefe things i began to inftru6t him in the know-
ledge of the true God. I told him, that the great maker
of all things lived there, pointing up towards heaven:
that he governs the world by the fame power and pro-
vidence by which he made it: that he was omnipotent,
could do every thing for us ; give every thing tons, take*
every thing from us; and thus, by degrees 1 opened his
eyes: he liftencd with great attention and received
with pleafure the notion of Jcfus Chrift being fent to re-
deem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to
God, and his being able to hear us, even into heaven:
as told me one day, that if our God could hear us up
beyond the fun, hemufl needs he a greater God than
their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, til! they went up to the great mountains
where he dwelt, to fpeak to him? He faid, No, they never
went that were ycung men: none went thither bvx the
©Id men j whom he called their Oowookakee, th?.t is, as I
made him explain it to* me, their religion, or clerry;
and thaXijt^T went to fay Q (fo he called faying prayers)
'* '• ''stud
 
and then came bark, and told them what Benamuckee
laid: by this I obferved, that there is prieftcraft even
amongft the moft blinded ignorant Pagans in the world;
and the policy of making a fecret religion, in order to
preferve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is
not only to be found in the Roman, but perhips among
all religions in the woi id, even among the moft brutifh
and barbarous lavage...
i endeavoured toclearupthisfraud to my man Friday;
and told him, that the pretence of their old men goin<;
up to the moan tains to fay O to their pod Benamuckee,
was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what*
he laid, was much more fo; that if they met with any
anfwer, or fpoke with any one there, it muft be with an
evil fpirit: and then I enteied into a long diiconrle with
him about the devil, the original of him, his rebellion
againll God, his enmity to man, the reafon of it, his
letting himielf up in the dark parts of the world to be
worshipped inflead of God, and as God, and the many
il-atai-fms he made ufe of,, to delude mankind to their
ruin; how he had a fecret accefs to our paflions, and to
uur affections, to adapt his fnares fotoour inclinations,
as to cauie us even to be our own tempters, and to run
upon our own delfruction by our own choice.
Hound it was not fo eafy to imprint right notions in
his mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a
God; nature a rafted all my arguments to evidence tor
Lirn even the neceilky of a great hi ft caufe, and ovei>
1 ui in a governing power, 3 ice ret directing Providence,
and of the equity and juftice of paying homage to him
that made us, and the like : but there appeared nothing
ci all this in the notion of an evil fpirit, of his original,
his being, his nature* and above all, of his inclination ft>
do evil, and to draw us in to do fo too: and the poor
creature puzzled me once in fuch a manner, by aquef-
tion merely natural end innocent, that I fcarce knew
what to fay to him, I had been talking a great deal to
him of the power of God, his omnipotence, his dread-
ful aveifion to fin, his being a confuming fire to the
workers of imq.hy; how, as' he had made us all, he
could dtft. oy us, ?.nd r ll the v/ci!dy in a moment; and
he liitened with treat ferioufnefs to me ail the while. -- 
After
 
 
After this, I had been telling him how the devil wai
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and ufed all his ma-
lice and fkill to defeat the good defigns of Providence,
and to ruin the kingdom of Chrift in the world, and the
like: Well, fays Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong,
fo great, is he not much ftrong, much might, as the de-
vil? Yes, yes, faid I, Friday, God is Wronger than the
devil, God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to
God to tread him under our feet, and enable us to refift
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But, fays he
again, if God much ftrong, much might, as the devil,
why God not kill the devil, fo make him no more wicked?
I was itrangeiy furprifed at his queftion, and after all,
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young
doctor, and ill enough qualified for a cafuift, or a folver
of difficulties t and, at fir It, I could not tell what to fay;
fo I pretended not to hear him, and afkcd him what he
faid: but he was to© eameft for an anfwer to forget his
queftion; fo that he repeated it in the very fame broken
words, as above. But this time! had recovered myfelfa.
little, and I faid, God will at laft pimilh him feverely, he-
is referved for the judgment, and is to be caft into the
bottomlefs pit, :; . 41 with eve Hailing fire: this did
not fatisfy Frid ;h-. * he returns upon me repeating my.
words, Reierve ; •:me no underftand: but why not
lull the devil now, u.^ -dil great ago? You may as well
tJk me, £iid T, wh-~'does not kill you and me, when
we do wicked thin; i v* thut o.iend him: we are pre-
served to repent an*; •: p'-.rdoned. He mufes a while at
this; Well, well, i-» • . mighty aftecYionately, that
well, lb you, J, dc\ 1, :di wicked, all preferve, repent,
God pardon all t her I v v . run down again by him to
the Lilt degree, and it was a teftimony to me, how the
mere notions of nan t - ugh they will guide reafon-
able creatures to- the :'*-o *U ige of a God, and of a wor-
Ihip or homage due t; rr.<- iupveme being of God* as the
confequencc of our n :yet nothing but divine re-
velation can form the knirvlcdge of Jeius Chrift, and of
a* redemption purcha«V d us: of a mediator; of a new
covenant; and of an intereeftar at the footftool of God's
tjirone, I fay nothing hut a revelation from heaven can
from tbeft.i&tke fcnii and.that, therefore the Gofpel of
. our
 
our Lord and Saviour Jefus Chri.it, I mean the word of
God, and the fpirit of God, promifed for the guide and
fanclirler of his people, are the abfoiutely neceffary in-
rlructors of the foals of men in the favtng knowledge of
God, and the means of faivation.
I therefore diverted the prefent difcourfe between mf
and my man, riling up haftily, as upon fome fudden oc-
caiion of going out; then fending him for fomething a
great way off, I ferioully prayed to God, that he would
enable me to inftruct favingly this poor favage, afliiting
by his Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to.
receive the light of the knowledge of God in Chrift, re-
conciling him to himfelf, and would guide me to fpeak
fo to him from the word of -God, as his confeience
might be conceived, his eyes opened, and his foul favedt
when he came again to me, I entered into a long dif-
courfe with him upon the fubjedl of the redemption of
man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of
the Gofpe! preached from heaven, viz. of the repent-
ance towards God, and faith in our blefled Lord Jefus t
I then explained to him, as well as I could, why our
bleiled Redeemer took not on hirr* the nature of angels,
but the feed of Abraham, and hew for. that reafon the
fallen angels had no mare in the redemption; that he
came only to the loft iheep of the houfe of Ifrael, and
the like.
I had, God knows, more ftneerity than knowledge, rn
all the methods F took for this poor creature's inftruetionr
end rrmft acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon
the fame principle will find, that in laying things open
to him, 1 really informed and inHrucled myfelf, in many
things that either I did not know, or had not fuHy con-*
fide red before; but which occurred naturally to my mind*
upon my fearching into them, for the information of this
poor favage; and! had more afreelion in my enquiry
after things upon this occanon, than ever I felt before;
fo that whether this poor wild wretch was the better for
Hie or no, I *nad great reafon to be thankful, that ever
be came to me: my grief fat lighter upon me, my ha-
bitation grew comfortable to me beyond rneafure; and
when I reflected, that in this folitary life which I had
been confined to, I had not only been moved myfelf ta
 
 
 
 
look up to heaven, and to feek to the hand that brought
me thither, but was now to be made an inftrument, un-
der Providence, to fave the life, and, for aught I know,
the foul, of a poor favage, and bring him to the true
knowledge of religion, and of the Chriltian doctrine,,
that he might know Chrifl Jefus, to know whom is life
Tternai; I fay, when I reflected upon all things, a
fecret joy ran through every part of my foul, and I fre-
quently rejoiced, that ever I was brought to this place,
which j had often thought the mod dreadful of all af-
flictions that could poflibly have befallen me.
In this thank fill frame I continued all the remainder
of my time, and the converfation whkh employed the
hours between Friday and me was luch, as made the
three years which we lived there together perfectly and

nefs can be found in a fublunary ftate: the favage was
now a good Chriftian, a much better than I; though I
have reafon to hope, and blefs God for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted reftored penitents: we
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off
from his Spirit to inftnut, that if we had beenin England.
I always applied myfelf to reading the fcripture, and
to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what
1 read; and he again, bv his ferious enquiries and quef-
tjons, made me, as I faid jefore, a much better fcholar in.

As to the difputes, wranglings, ftrife, and contention,
which have happened in the world about religion, whether
niceties in docdriner, or fchcmcs of church government,
they were all perfectly ufelefs to us, as, for aught I can
vet fee, they have been to ail the reft in the world; we
had the fure guide to heaven, viz* the Word of (tod;
and we had, bleiled be God, comfortable views of the
Spirit of God, leaching and inftrucling us by his Word,
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the induction of his Word; and I cannot fee
tli- loaft ufc that the greater! knew] edge of the difputed-

the world, would have been to ik;, if we could have ob-
tained it; but I mu!t go on with the hiftorical part of
things, and take every unr: in its erdcr.
After Friday and 11jecame mere intimately acquainted,
and that he could underhand alraofl all 1 laid to him,
and iprak fluently, though in broken Erxgiiih, to me; I
acquainted him with my own iloty, or at kail fo muck
of it as related to my coming into the place, how I had*
lived there, and how long; I let him into the myftery
(for fuch it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and
taught h*m how to fhoot; I gave him a knife, which he
was wonderful1)', delighted with, an 1 J made him a belt
with a frog hanging to it, fuch as in England we wear
hangers in; and in the frog, in Read of an hanger, I
gave him an hatchet, which was not only as good a
weapon in fome cafes, bat much more ufeful upon many
occafions."
1 deferibed to htm the countries of Europe, and parti-
cularly England, which I came from; how we lived,
how we wonhippedj God, how we behaved to one an-
other, and how we traded in Ihips to ail the part., of the
world; I gave him an account of the wreck which i had
been on board of, and fhewed him, as near as I could,
the place where flic lay; but fhe was all beaten in pieces
long before, and quite gone.
I fhewed him the ruins of our boat, which we loll when
we efcaped, and which I could not (It with my whole
ftrength then, but was now fallen almofl all to pieces;
upon feeing this boat, Friday flood mufing a great while,
and faid nothing; I afked him what it was he ftudied
upon t

ADVENT V RES O F
upon? at laft, fays he, Me fee fuch boat like conic to
place at my nation.
I did not underftand him a good while; hut at laft,
when I kid examined further into it, I underftood by
hint, that a boat, fucli as that had been, came :>n ihorc
upou the country where he lived ; that is, as he explained
it, was driven i hither by dire fs of weather: I prefently
imagined, that fume European fliip mull have been call
away upon their coaft, and the boat might get loofe, and
drive aihore ; but was lb dull, that I never once thought
of men making cfcape from a wreck thither, much lefs
whence they might come; fo I only enquired after a de-
fcriptkm of the boat.
Friday defcribed the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to underftand him, when he added,
with fome warmth, We fave the white mans from drown :.
Then I prefendy alked him, if there were any white mans,
as he called them, in the boat; Yes, he faid, the boat full
of white mans t I afked him, how many? he told upon
his fingers feventeen :. I aiked him then, what became of
them? he told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head again; fori
prefently imagined, that thefe might be the men belong-
ing to the fhip that was call away in fight of my ifland,.
as I now call it; and who, after the fhip was flruck on
the rock, and they law her inevitably loft, had faved
themfelves in their boat, and were landed upon that
wild fhore among the favages.
Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what was
become of them; he allured me they lived Hill there,
that they had been there about four year*, that the favages
let them alone, and gave them vidua! s to live; I afked
him, how it came to pafs they did not kill them, and
eat them? He faid, No, they make brother with them:
that is, as I underftood him, a truce: and then he add-
ed, They eat no mans but when make the war light:
that is to fay, they never eat any men, but fuch as come
to fight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this, fome conliderablc time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the eaft fide of the ifland,
from whence, as I have faid, I had in a clear day dlfco-
vered the main or continent of America; Friday, the wea-
ther

thcr being very fcrenc, loriks very earner!] y towards the
main land, and in a kind of fur prize falls a jumping and
dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at fome di fiance
from him; I afked him what was the matter I O joy!
Ays he, O glad! there ice my country, there my nation!
1 ohferved an extraordinary fenfe of pleafure appeared
in his free, and his eyes fp.irk!ed, and hi*; countenance
uncovered a ftrange eagernefs, as if he had a mind to
be in his own country again; and this obfervattoa of
mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made
me at hrit not Co eafy about my new man Friday, as
I w,.s before: and I ra.Jc no doubt, but that, if Friday
could get bnck to his own nation again, he would not
only forget all his religion, but all his obligations to
me; and would be forward enough to give his country-
men an account of me, and come back, per hap .j with
an hundred or two of them, ami make a feuit upen me,
at which he might be as merry as he ufed to be with thofe
of his enemief, when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honeft creature very much,
for which I was very forry afterwards: however, as my
jealoufy increafed, and held mo fome weeks, I was a
little more circumfpecl, and not fo familiar and kind to
him as before; in which I was certainly in die wrong
too, the honeft grateful creature having no thought
about it, but what confided of the beft principles, both
as a religious Chriftian, and as a grateful friend, as ap-
peared afterwards to my full fatis faction.
Whilft my jealoufy of him laded, you may be fare I was
every day pumping him to fee if he would difcover any
of the new thoughts, which I fufpected were in him; but
I found every thing he raid was fo honeft, and fo innocent,
that I could find nothing to nourifh my fa fp lei on: and,
in fpite of all my uneaimefs, he made me at lad entirely
his own again; nor did he in the leaft perceive, that I was
uneafy; and therefore I could not fufpecl him of deceit.
One day, walking up the fame hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at fea, Co that we could not fee the
continent, I called to him, and faid, Friday, do not
you with yourfelf in your own country, your own na-
tion? Yes, he faid, I be much O glad to be at my own
ration. What would you do there? faid I: would you.

A D V E N T U R E S O F
turn wild again, eat mens fiefh again, and be a favage
as you were before? He looked full of concern, and,
leaking his head, faid, No, no, Friday tell them to live
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flcfh, milk, no cat man again. Why then, faid 1 to
him, they will kill you; he locked grave at that, and then
faid, No, they no kill me, they willing love learn; he
meant by this, they would be willing to learn; he added,
they learned much of the bearded mens that came in the
boat; then I afked him, if he would go back to them?
He fmiled at that, and told me he could not fwim fo far;
I told him I would make a canoe for him; he told me
he would go, if I would go with him. 1 go! faid 1,
why they will eat me if I come there; No, no, fays he,
me make them no cat you, me make they much love you;
he meant he would tell them how I had killed his ene-
mies and faved his- life, and fo he would malce^ them
love me; then he told use as well as he could, how kind
they were to ieventeen vvi i e men, or bearded men, as
he called them, who came cm fbcre in diilrefs.
From this time, I confefs, I had a mind to venture
ever, and fee if I could poIHbiy join with thefe bearded
men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu-
guese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find feme
method to efeape from thence, being \i\ o \ the conti-
nent, and a good company together, better than I could
from an ilhtnd forty milts off the fhore, and alone with-
out help; fo, after fome days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of difcourfe; and told him, I-would give
him a boat to go back to his own nation; and accord-
ingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
fide of the iHand; and having cleared it of w;*tt (for I
always kept it funk in the water) I brought it out, mewed
it him, and we both went into it.
J found he was a mo ft dextrous fellow at managing
it, Would make it go almoft as fwift and fait again as i
could; fo when he was in, I faid to him, Weil, now
Friday, fhall we go to your nation? He looked very
„dull at my faying fo, which, it fecms, was becaufe he
thought the boat toofmall to go fo far; I told him then
I had a bigger; fo the next "day, I went to the place
where the tot boat lay which I had made, but which I
'_ ..i f
 
I could not i?et into the water; he faid that was bis:
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it
had lain two or three and twenty years there, the fun
had fplit and dryed it, that it was in a manaer rotten.
Friday told me, fuch a boat would do very we!1, and
would carry * much enough vittle, drink, bread,* that
was his way of talking.
Upon the.whole, I was by this time fo fixed upon my
defign of going over with him to the continent, that L
told him we would go and make one as big as that, and
he Humid go home in it. Ho atdV/erei not one word,
but looked very grave and fad. I afked him what was
the matter with him. He afked me again, thus, Why you
angry mad with Friday? what :ne done? I afked him
what he meant; I told him 1 was not angry with him at
all: No angry 1 no angry! (ay- he, repeating the words
feveral time?, Why fend 'Friday home away to my na-
tion? Why, faid I, Friday, did you not fay you wifhed
you were there? Yer, yes, lays he, wifti. be both there, no
wifti Friday there, no mailer there. In a word, he
would not think of going there without me. I go there,
Friday! faid I, what fhould I do there? He turned very
quick upon- me at this; You do great deal much good,
fays he, you teach wild mans be good, fober, tame mans;
you tell them know God* pray God, and live new life.
Alas, Friday, faid I, thou knowefr. not what thou layeit;
1 am but an ignorant man myfelf. Yes, ye?, f<ys he,
you teechee rne good, you teeche them good. No, in),
Friday, faid I, you ihail go without me; leave me here
to live by myfelf, as I did before. Fie looked cenfufed
«gain at that word, and running to one of the hatchets
which, he ufed to wear, he. takes it up haft?ly, and give**
it me, AVhatmuft I do with this? faid I to him: you
take kill Friday, fays he. Wh,?t mu:t I kill you for?
faid i again. Fie returns very quick. What yoa fend
Friday away k r? Take kiil I rklay, no fend Friday
away. This he fpoke fo "earrrltfy, that I fiw tears
kind in his eyes. In a word, 1 io plainly difcovered
the utmolt affection in hirn to mr, a;*: a firm refolu-
tion ii him, that I told Lim the a, and efien afte , that
I would never i«*n.d him awr.y iiem me, k he was witling
to Hay with me.
Upon
 
 
Upon the whole, as I found by all his difcourfe, a
fettled affection to me, and that nothing mould part
him from me, fo I found all the foundation of his de-
fire to go to his own country, was laid in his ardent af-
fection to the people, and his hopes of rf!y doing them
good; a thing, which as I had no notion of myfelf, fo
I had not the leail thought, or intention, or dehre of un-
dertaking it: but ftill I found a ftronginclination to ray
attempting an efcape, as above, founded on the fuppofi-
tion gathered from the former difcourfe; viz. that there
were feventeen bearded men there; and therefore, with-
out any delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out
a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua
or canoe, to undertake the voyage: there were trees
enough in the ifland to have built a little fleet, not of
periaguas and canoes only, but even of good large vef-
fels; but the main thing I looked at, was to get one fo
near the water, that we might launch it when it was
made, to avoid the miftake I committed at firlh
At laft, Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he
knew much better than I, what kind of wood was fittehV
for it; nor can I tell to this day, what wood to call the
tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree
we call fuftick, or between that and the Nicaragua
wood, for it was much of the fame colour and fmell:
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this
tree out, to make it into a boat: but 1 fhewed him. how
rather to cut it out with tools, which after I mewed him
how to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a month's
hard labour we finifhed it, and made it very hand-
lome, efpecially when with our axes, which 1 mewed
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outfide, into
the true ftiape of a boat; after this, however, it coll us
near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into the water: but when
fhe was in, fhe would have carried tw*. ;ty men with
great eafe.
When fhe was in the water, and though fhe was fo big,
it amazed me to fee with what dexterity and how fwift
my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and pad-
dle her along; fo I afked him if he would, and if we
might venture over in her: Yes, he laid, he venture over
 
 
 
 
in her very well, though great blow wind: however, I had
a farther defign that he knew nothing of, and that wa*
to make a mail and fail, and to fit her with an anchor
and cable: as to a malt, that was cafy enough to get;
fo I pitched upon a ftrait young cedar-tree, which I
found near the place, and which there, was a great plenty
of in the ifland: and I fet Friday to work to cut it
jown, and gave him directions how to fhape and order
it: but as to the fail, that was my particular care;
I knew I had old fails, or rather pieces of old fails
enough; but as I had them now twenty-fix years by
me, and had rot been very careful to preferve them,
not imagining that I mould ever have this kind of ufe
for them, 1 did not doubt but they were all rotten; and
indeed moil of them were fo; however, I found two
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with thefe I
went to work, and with a great deal of pains, and auk-
ward tedious Hitching (you may be fare) for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing,
like what we call in England a moulder of mutton fail,
to go with a boom at bottom, and a little fhort fprit at
the top, fuch as ufually our mips long-boats fail with, and
inch as I bell knew how to manage; becaufe it was fuch
a one as I ufed in the boat in which I made my efcape
from Barbary, as related in the firifc part of my ftory.
I was near two months performing this ls.il work;
viz. rigging and fitting ray mall and fails; for I fwimed
them very complete, making a {mail nay, and a fail or
forefail to it, to affilt, if we mould turn to windward;
and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the
ftern of her, to freer with; and though I was l^ut a bung-
ling fhipw right, yet as i knew the ufefulnefs, and even
neceiTlty of fuch a thing, 1 applied rnyfelf with fo much
pains to do it, that at hit I brought it to pafs, tho%
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that
failed, I think it coil me almoll as much labour as
making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat;
for tho' he knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he
knew nothing what belonged to a fail and a rudder,
and was the molt amazed when he faw me work the
boat
 
 
 
 
 
boat to--and-again in the Tea by the rudder, and how the
fail gybed, and filled this way or that way, as the courfe
we failed changed; 1 fay, when he faw this, he flood
like one aftoniihcd and amazed: however, with a little
ufe, I made all thefe things familiar to hirr, and he be-
came an expert faijor, except that as to the compafV, I
could make him under!rand very little of that: on the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and
feldom or never any fogs in thofe parts, there was the
lefs occailon for a compafs, feeing the ftars were always
to be feen by night, and the iliore by day, except in
the rainy feafons; and then nobody cared to flir abroad,
either by land or lea.
I was now entered on the feven and twentieth year of
my captivity in this place; though the three laft years
that I had this creature with me, ought rather to be
left out of the account, my habitation being quite of
another kind than in all the reft of my time. I kept
the anniverfary of my landing here with the fame thank-
fulnefs to G od for his mercies as at firft; and if I had fuch
caufe of acknowledgment at hrfl, I had much more fo
now, having fuch additional teftimonies of the care of
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and fpeedily delivered; fori had an invincible
irnprelfion upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was
at hand, and that I ihould not be another year in this
place; however, I went on with my hulbandry, digging,
_ planting, fencing* as ufual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every neceflary thing, a^ before.
The rainy fealbn was in tlie mean time upon me,
when 1 kept more within doors than at other times;
fo I fcad itov/ed our new veflel as fecure as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I laid in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the fhip; and
haling her up to the more, at high-water ma.k, I
made my man Friday dig a little dock, juft big enough
for her to float in; and then when the tide was out,
we made a flror-g dam. acrofs the end of it, to foep
the water out; and fo fhe lay dry, as to the tide,
from the ft;a; and to k ep the rain off, we laid a great
many boughs of trees fo thick, that fhe was as well
thatched
thatched as an houfe; and thus we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I defigned to
make my adventure.
When the fettled feafon began to come in, as the
thought of my defjgn returned with the fair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the firll thing
I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provi lion, being
tkc 11 ore for the voyage; and intended in a week or a
fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our
boat 1 I was bufy one morning upon fomething of this
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the fea-
fhore, and fee if he could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing
which we generally got once a week, for the fake of the
<%gs, as well as the flefh. Friday had not been long gone,
when he came running back, and flew over my outward
wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the
fteps he fethis feet on; and before I had time to fpeak
to him, he cried out to me, O mafter 1 O mailer! O for-
row! O bad! What's the matter, Friday? laid 1 ; O yon-
der there, fays he, one, two, three, canoe! one, two,
three 1 By this way of fpeaking I concluded there were
fix: but on enquiry I found there were but three. Well
Friday, laid I, do not be frighted; fo I heartened him up
as well c.s I could: However, I faw the poor fellow mofr.
terribly feared ; for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces,
mid eat him; the poor fellow trembled fo, that I fcarce
knew what to do with him: I comforted him as well as
1 could, and told him 1 was in as much danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well *as him, But, faid I,
Friday, we muft refolve to fight them: Can you fight,
Friday? Me fhoot, fays he, but there come many great
number. No matter for that, faid I again, our guns
WM fright them that we do not kill. So I aiked him,
Whether, if 1 refolved to defend him, he would defend
r- % and lland by me, and do juitas I bade him? He faid,
Me die, when you bid die, mafter; fo 1 went and fetched
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been fo
good an hulbandof my rum, that I had a great deal left:
}Vhen he had drank it, 1 made him take the two fowl-
ing pieces which we always carried, and load them with
large fwan mot as big as a'fmall piitol-buliets; then I took
Vol. I. K four
 
 
four mufquets, and loaded them with twoflugs, and five
fmall bullets each; and my two pifiols I loaded with a
brace of bullets each: I hung my great fword, as ufual,
naked by my fide, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myfelF, I took my perfpec-
tive-giafs, and went up to the fide of the lull, to fee
what I could difcover; and I found quickly, by my
glafs, that there were one and twenty favages, three
prifoners, and three canoes; and that their whole bu-
finefs feemed to be the triumphant banquet upon thefe
three human bodies; a barbarous feaft indeed, but no-
thing more than as I had obferved was ufual with them.
I obferved alfo, that they were landed, not where they
had done when Friday made his efcape, but nearer to ni/
creek, where the more was low, and where a thick wood
came clofe almoft down to the fea: this, with the ab-
horrence of the inhuman errand thefe wretches came
about, fo filled me with indignation, that I came
down again to Friday, and told him, I was refolved to go
down to them, and kill them all; and afked him if he
would Hand by me. He was now gotten over his fright,
and his fpirits being a little raifed with the dram I had
given him, he was very chearfui; and told me, as be-
fore, he would die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took firft and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before, between us: I gave Fri-
day one piftol to flick in his girdle, and three guns upon
his moulder ; and I took one piito!, and the other three,
myfelf; and in this pofture we marched out; I took a
fmall bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a
large bag with more powder and bullet; and as to or-
ders, I charged him to keep clofe behind me, and not to
Itir, fhoot, or do any thing till I bid him; and in the
mean time, not to fpeak a word: in this pofture I fetched
a compafs to my right hand of near a mile, as well to
get over the creek as to get into the wood; fo that I
might come within (hot of them before I could be dif-
covered, which I had feen by my glafs it was eafy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began to abate my refolut'ron; I donot mean,
that I entertained any fear of their number; fo as they
were naked, unarmed wretches, 'tis certain I wasfupei ior
to
 
 
 
to them; nay, though I had been alone : But it occurred
to my thoughts, what call, what occafion, much lefs,
what neceffity, I was in to go and dip my hands in blood,
to attack people, who had neither done or i ntended me any
wrong, who as to me, were innocent,'and whofe barba-
rous c idioms were their own di fatter, being in them a
token indeed of God's having left them, with the other
nations of that part of the world, to fuch ftupidity and
to fuch inhuman courfes; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much lefs an exe-
cutioner of his juttice; that whenever he thought fit, he
would take the caufe into his own hands, and by natio-
nal vengeance puniih them for national crimes; but that
in the mean time, it was none of my buiinefs; That it
was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he was a declared
enemy, and in a ftate of war with thofe very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
could not lay the fame with refpeftto me: Thefe things
were fo warmly prefled upon my thoughts all the way
as I went, that I refolved I would only go place myfclf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous feaft,
and that I would aft then as God fhould direct; but that
unlefsfomething offered that was more a call to me than
yet I knew7 of, I would not meddle with them.
With this rcfolution I entered the wood, and with
all poflible warinefs andfilen e (Friday following clofe
at my heels), 1 marched till I came to the fkirt of the
wood, on the fide which was next to them; only that
one corner of the wood lay between me and them:
Here I called foftly to Friday, and mewing him a great
tree, which was juft at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could fee
there plainly what they were doing. He did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might be plain-
ly viewed there; that they were all about the fire, eating
theflem of one of their prifoners; and that another lay
bound upon the fand, a little from them, whom he f ad
they would kill next, and which fired the very foul within
me. He told me, it was not one of their nation, but one of
the boarded men whom he had told me of, who came to
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the
yery naming the white-btarded man, and, going to the
K 2 tree,
 
tree, I faw plainly, by my glafs, a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the fea, with his hand and his feet
tied with flags, or things like ruflies; and that he was
an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yard^ nearer to them than the place where
I was, which, by going a littly way about, I faw I might
come at undifcovered, and that then I mould be within
half mot of them; fo I with-held my palfion, tho' I was
indeed enraged to the higheft degree; and going back
about twenty paces, I got behind fome bullies, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and then I
came to a little rifing ground, which gave me a full view
of them, at the diftance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lofe; for nineteen of the
dreadful wretches, fat upon the ground all clofe huddled
together, and had juft fent the other two to butcher the
poor Chriftian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb, to
their fire; and they were ftooped down to untie the bands
at his feet. I turned to Friday ; Now, Friday, faid I, do
as I bid thee. Friday faid, he would. Then, Friday, faid I,
do exactly as you fee me do; fail in nothing. So I fet down
one of the mufquets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
mufquet I took my aim at the favages, bidding him do
the like. Then a/king him if he was ready, he faid, Yef.
Then fire at them, faid I; and the fame moment I fired alfo.
Friday took his aim fo much better than I, that on the
fide that he Ihot, he killed two of them, and wounded
three more; and on my fide, 1 killed one, and wounded
two. They were, you may be fure, in a dreadful coniter-
nation; and all of 'em, who were not hurt, jumped up
upon their feet immediately, but did not know which way
to run, or which way to look; for they knew not from
whence their deftru&ion came. Friday kept his eyes
clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he might obferve
what I did; fo as foon as the firft mot was made, I threw
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like; he fees me cock, and prefent; he
did the fame again. Are you ready, Friday? faid L Yes,
fays he, Let fly tlwn, faid I, in the name of God ; and
with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and
 
 
 
2ft I
fo did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden with
what I called fwan-fhot, or fmall piltol bullets, we found
only two drop; but fo many were wounded, that they
ran about veiling and fcreaming like mad creatures, all
bloody and rmferahly wounded, moll of them; whereof
three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, faid I, laying down the difcharged pieces,
and taking up the mufquet, which was yet loaden, follow
me, faid 1; which he did, with a deal of courage; upon
which I rallied out of the wood, and ihewed myfelf, and
Friday clofe at my foot: As foon as I perceived they faw
me, I fhouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do fo
too; and running as fait as I could, which by the way was
not very fail, being loaded with arms as I was, I made di-
rectly towards the poor victim, who was, as i faid, lying
upon the beach, or more, between the place where they
fat and the fea ; the two butchers, who were juft going to,
work with him, had left him, at the furprife of our firft
fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the fea-fide, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the relt made the
fame way: I turned to Friday, and bade him Rep forwards,
and fire at them; he underflood me immediately, and
running about forty yards to be hear them, he mot at
them, as I thought he had killed them all; for I faw
them all fall on an heap into the boat; though I faw
two of them up again quickly: However, he killed two
<tf them, and wounded the third, fo that he lay down in
the bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and
loofmg his hands and feet I lifted him up, and afked him
in the Portuguefe tongue, what he was? He anfwered
in Latin, Oiriftianus; but was fo weak and faint, that
he could fcarce ftand, or fpeak; I took my bottle out of
my pocket, and gave it him, making figns that he mould
drink, which he* did; and I gave him a piece of bread,,
which he eat; then I afked him, what countryman he
was? and he faid, Efpagnole; and, being a little re-
covered, let me know, by all the figns he could pombly
make, how much he was in debt for his deliverance;
Seignior, faid I, with as much Spanifli as I could
nuke up, we will talk afterwards, but we muft fight
K 3 now;
 
 
 
 
now: If you have any flrength left, take this piftoi and
fword, and lay about you, He took them very thank-
fully, and no fooner had he the arms in his hands, but
as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his
murderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces
in an inftanr; for the truth is, as the whole was a furprife
to them, fothe poor creatures were fo much frighted with
the noifc of our pieces, that they fell down for mere
amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt
their own efeape, than their flefh had to refill our fhot;
and that \v?s the cafe of thofe five that Friday fhot in
the boat jf for as three of them fell with the hurt they
received, fo the other two fell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand frill, without firing, being
willing to keep my charge ready, becaufe I had given the
Spaniard my piftoi and (word; fo I called to Friday, and
bade him run up to the tree from whence we fhfl fired,
and fetch the arms which lay there, that had been dis-
charged, which he did with great fvviftnefs; and then
giving him my rnufquet, 1 fat down myfclf to load all the
reft again, -and hade them come to me when they wanted:
While I was leading thefe pieces, there happened a fierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the favage?,
who made at him with one of their great wooden fwords,
the fame weapon that was to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it The Spaniard, who was as bold
and as brave as could be imagined, tho* weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut him two great
wounds on his head; but the favage, being a flout lufly
fallow, deling in with him, had thrown him down
(being faint) and was wringing my fword out of his
hand$ when the Spaniard, tho'undermofl, wifely quitting
his fword, drew the pillo! from his girdle, fhot the favage
through the body, and killed him upon the fpot, before
L who was running to help, could come near him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, purfued the flying
w etches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet;
and with that he difpatched thofe three, who, as I fa id
before, were wounded at iirft and fallen, and all the rdt
he could come tip with; and the Spaniard coming to
rn* for a g\:n, I gave hi in one of the fowling pieces,
with which he purfued two of the favage s, and wounded
than
 
 
them both; but as he was not able to run, they both
£ot from him into the wood, where Friday purfued
them, and killed one of them; but the other was too
nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet he
plunged into the fea, and (Warn with all his might off
to thofe who were left in the canoe, which three in the
canoe, with one wounded who we know not whether
he died or no, were all that efcaped our hands of one
and twenty. The account of the reft is as follows;
3 Killed at our fhot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next fhot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of thofe at fir ft wounded,
z Killed by dr.to, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard,
4 Killed, being found dropt here and there of then
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chace of them.
4 Efcaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not
dead.
21 In all
 
Thofe that were in the canoe, worked hard to get out
of gun-fhot; and tho' Friday made two or three fhotsat
tiiem, I did not find that he hit any of them: Friday
would fain have had me take one of their canoes, and
piii fue them; and indeed I was very anxious about thkir
efrape, left carrying the news home to their people,
they mould < one back, perhaps, with two or three hun-
dred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multitudes;
fo I confented to purfue them by fea; and running to
one cf their canoes, 1 jumped in, and bade Friday fol-
low me; but when I was in the canoe, I was furprifed
to Had another poor creature lie there alive, bound
hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the (laughter,
and almoft dead with fear, not knowing what the mat-
ter was; for he had not been able to look up over the
hde of the boat, he was tied fo hard, neck and heels,
and had been tied fo long, that he had really little life
in him.
& 4 I ironic-
 
 
I immediately cut the twilled flags, or nifties, which
they had bound him with, and would have help him up;
but he could not Hand, or fpeak, but groaned molt pite-
oufly, believing, it feems Hill, that he was only un-
bound in order to be killed.
When/Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling cut my bot-
tle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he fit
up in the boat; brt when Friday came to hear him fpeak,
and looked in his face, it would have moved any one to
tears, to have feen how Friday killed him, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, fung, then cried again, wrunp- his hands, beat
las own face and head, and then fung and jumped about
again, like a diilracled creature. I was a good while,
before I could make him fpeak to me, or tell me what
was the matter, but when he came a little to himfelfV he
told me, that it was his father.
It was not eafy for me to exprefs how It moved me, to
fee what extacy and filial affection had worked in this
poor favage, at the fight of his father, and of his being
delivered from death; nor indeed can I defcribe half the
extravagancies of his afFcclion after this; for he went into
the .boat and out of the boat a great many times: when
he went into him, lie would fit down by him, open his
breaft, and hold his father's head clofe to his boforn, half
an hour together, to nourilh it: then he took his arms and
ankles, which were numbed and (liff with the binding,
and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, per-
ceiving what the cafe was, gave him fome rum out of
my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal
of good.
This action put an end to our purfuit of the canoe
with the other favages, who were now gotten almolt out
of fight; and it was happy for us, that we did not;
for it blew fo hard within two hours after, and before
they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and conti-
nued blowing fo hard all night, and that from the north-
weft, which was again them, that I could not (uppou^
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their
own coaft.
But
 
 
 
But to return to Friday; he was fo bufy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for fome
time: but after I thought he could leave him a little, I call-
ed him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and
pleafed to the higheft extreme. Then I afked him, if he
had given his father any bread? He (hook his head, and
faid, None: ugly dog eat all upfelf. So I gave him a cake
of bread out of a little pouch I carried on purpofe ; I alio
gave him a dram for himfelf, but he would not tafte it,
but carried it to his father: I had in my pocket alfo two
or three bunches of my raifins^ fo I gave him a handful
of them for his father. He had no fooner given his father
thefe raifins, but 1 faw him come out of the boat and
runaway as if he had been bewitched. He ran at fuch a
rate (for he was the fwifteit fellow of his feet that ever t
faw) I fay, he ran at fuch a rate, that he was out of fight,
as it were in a infant; and tho* I called and hallooed
too after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I faw him come back again, tho' not
fo fa ft as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his
pace was flacker, becaufe he had fomething in his hand*
When he came up to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father fome
freih water; and that he had got two more cakes or
loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the water
he carried to his father: however, as I was very thirfty
too, I took a little fup of it: this water revived his fa-
ther more than all the rum or fpirits I had given him;
for he was juit fainting with thirft.
When his father had drank, J called him, to know if
there was any water left; he faid, yes; and I bade him
give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want
of it as his father; and I fent one of the cak?s, that
Friday brought, to the Spaniard, too, who was indeed
very weak, and was repofing himfelf upon a green place,
under the made of a tree, and whofe limbs were alfo
vcry ft iff, and very much (Welled with the rude bandage
he had been tied With: when I fr.v that upon Friday's
convng to him with the water, he fit up and drank, and
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him. and gave
km an handful of raifins; he looked up in my face with
ad the tokens of gratitude and thankfulnefs that could
K 5' 'appear
 
 
appear in any countenance; but was fo weak, notwith-
franding he had fo exerted himfelf in the fight, that he
could not Ib.nd up upon his feet; he tried to do it two
or three times-, bin was really not able, his ankles were
fo 1 welled and fo painful to him; fo I bade him lit 11 ill,
and caufed Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with
rum, as he had done his father's.
I obferved the poor affectionate creature every two n:i-
notes or perhaps lefs, all the while he was here, turned
his head about, to fee if his father was in the fame place
and pofture a he left him fitting; and at laft he found he
was not to be leen; at which he fhrted up, and without
fpeaking a word, flew with that fwiftnefs to him, that
one could fearee perceive his feet to touch the ground
as lie went: but when he came, he only found he had
laid himfelf down to eafe his limbs: fo Friday came back
to me prefently, and I then lpoke to the Spaniard to let
Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat,
and then he Ihould carry him to our dwelling, where I
would take care of him: but Friday, a lufly young fel-
low, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car-
ried him away to the boat, and fet him down foftlyupon
the fide or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
fide of it, and then lifted them quite in, and fet him dole
to his father, and prefently ftepping out again, launched
the boat off, and paddled it along the more fafter than I
could walk, tho' the wind blew pretty hard too; fo he
brought the nt both fafe into our creek ; and leaving them
in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he
pa/Ted me, I fpoke to him, and afked him, whither he
went? He told me, Go, fetch more boat; fo away he
went, like the wind; for fure never man or hen'e ran
like him, and he had the other canoe in the creek, alnsoil
as foon as I got to it by land; fo he wafted me over, ^? id
then went to help our new gueifo out of the boat, which
. he did; but they were neither of them able to wnlk; io
that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and
calling to Friday to bid them fit clown on the ban*
while he came to me, I foon made a kind of hand-
barrow to lay them Qn, r.nd Friday and I carried them
\m bpth together upon it between us: but when we ?,ot
 
them to the outfide of our wall o fortification, we were
at a worfe Jofs than before; for it was impoffible to get
them over; and I was refolved not to break it down;
fo I fet to work again; and Friday and I, in about two
hours time, made a very,handforne tent, covered witli
old fails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in
the fpace without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted: ami
here we made two beds of fuch things as I had; viz. of
good rice-ftraw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and
another to cover them on each bed.
My ifland was now peopled, and I thought myfelf
very rich in &ibje£fo; and it was a merry reflection which
I frequently made, how like a king I looked: Firfi of
all the whole country was my own mere property; fo
that I had an undoubted right of dominion: adly, My
people were perfectly iubiecled; I was ahlolute lord and
lawgiver; they ail owed their lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their lives, if there had been oecafion
for it, for me: It was remarkable too, I had but three
fuhjects, and they were or three different religions. My
man Friday was a proteftant; his father a pagan and a
canibal ;. and the Spaniard was a papilt: however, I
allowed liberty of confcience throughout my dominions:
but this by the way.
As foon as I had fecured my two weak refcued prifon*-
crs, and given them fheker, and a place to reft them
upon, I began to think of making fome pro vifipn forthem:
snd the firlt thing I didr 1 ordei ed Friday to take a year-
ling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular
ftockj to be killed; then J cut off the hinder quarter,
and, chopping it into finall pieces, I kt Friday to work,
to boiling and flowing, and made them a very gcod.difh,
I allure you, of #efh*and broth; having put fome bar-
ky ?.nd rice alio into the broth; and as I cooked it
Without doors (for I mad.*' no-fire within my inner wall)
fo I carried it all into the new tent; and having fet a
t^ble ther^ for them, I fat down and c&i my air.ner alio
vith them; and, a: well as I could, cheared tliem anden-
couraged them, Friday being my interpreter, efpecialiy to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spa-
*uard fpofcc the language of the lavages pretty well.
K 6 After
 
 
 
 
After we had dined, or rather flipped, I ordered Friday
to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our mufquets
and other fire arms, which for want of time we had left
upon the place of battle; and the next day I ordered
him to go and bury the dead bodies of the favages, which
lay open to the fun, and would prefently be ofFenfive;
and I alfo ordered him to bury the horrid remains of
th r"barbarous feaft, which I knew were pretty much,
and which I could not think of doing myfelf; nay, I
could not bear to fee them, if I went that way: all
which he punctually performed, and defaced the very ap-
pearance of the favages being there; fo that when I went
again, I could fcarce know where it was, othervvife than
by the corner of the wood pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with
my two new fubjects; and firit I fet Friday to enquire of
his father, what he thought of the efcape of the favages
in that canoe, and whether he might expeel a return of
them with a power too great for us to refill? His firit
©pinion was, that the fayages in the boat never could live
out the ilorm, which blew that night they went off, but
muft of neceifity be drowned or driven fouth to thofe
other fhores, where they were as fure to be devoured, as
they were to be drowned if they were cart away; but as
to what they would do if they came fafe on more, he
faid, he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they were
fo dreadfully frighted with the manner of being attacked,
the noife, and the fire., that he believed they would tell
*heir people they were all killed by thunder and light-
ning, and not by the hand of man; and that the two
which appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly
Ipirits or furies come down to deftroy them, and not men
with weapons. This, he faid, he knew* becaufe he heard
them all cry out fo in their language to one another;
for it was impofiible to them to conceive that a mart
mould dart fire, and fpeak thunder, and kill at a dii-
tance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now.
And this, old favage was in the right, for, as I underftocd
fmce by other hands, the favages of that part never at-
tempted to go over to the ifland afterwards. They were
fo terriSed with the accounts given by thofe four men
(for it fee ins they did efcape the fea) that they believed,
whoever
 
 
 
 
whoever went to that enchanted illand, would be defiroy-
ed with lire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under
continual apprehenfions for a good while, and kept al-
ways upon my guard, I and all my army; for as we
w ere now four of us, I would have ventured upon an hun-
dred of them fairly in the open field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing,
the fear of their coming wore off, and I began to take
my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into confi-
deration, being likewife affured by Friday's father, that
I might depend upon good ufagc from their nation on his
account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little fufpended, when I had
a ferious difcourfe with the Spaniard, and when I un-
derftood, that there were fixteen more of his country-
men and Portuguefe, who having been cad away, and
made their efcape to that fide, lived there at peace in-
deed with the favages, but were very fore put to it for
neceflarics, and indeed for life; I afked him all the par-
ticulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanifh
fhip, bound from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havanna,
being direeled to leave their loading there, which was
chiefly hides and filver, and to bring back what Euro-
pean goods they could meet with there; that they had
live Portuguefe feamen on board, whom they took out of
another wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned,
when nril the fliip was loll; and that thefe efcaped
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived almofl
ilarved on the Canibal coaft, where they expected w
have been devoured every moment.
He told me, they had fome arms with them, but they
were perfectly ufelefs, for that they had neither powder
or ball, the warning of the fea having fpoiled all their
powder, but a little which they ufed at their firft land-
ing to provide themfelves fome food.
I afked him what he thought would become of them
there; and if they had formed no deftgn of making any
efcape? He faid, they had many confutations about it;
but that having neither vefiel, nor tools to build one,
or provifions o? any kind, their counfels always ended in
tears and defpair.'
I a'ked
 
 
 
I afked hi 11 how he thought they would receive a pro-
pofal from me, which might tend towards anefcape; and
whether, if they were all here, it might not be done ? I
told him with freedom, 1 feared moflly their treachery
and ill ufige of me, if I put my life in their hands; for
that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of
man; nor did men always fquare their dealings by the
obligations th y had received, fo much as they did by
the advantages they expected: I told him, it would be
very hard, that i mould be the inflrumentof their deli-
verance, and that they mould afterwards make me their
prifoner in Mew Spain, where an Englilhman wascertain
to be made a lacrifire, what neceflity, or what accident
foever, brought him thither; and that I had rather be
delivered up to the favages, and be devoured alive, then
fall into the mercilefs claws of the priefts, and be carried
into the inquifition. J added, that otherwife I was per-
ijaded, if they were all here, we might, with fomany
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away
either to the Brands fouthward, or to the i (lands or Spa-
ri iih coafi northward : bui that if in requital they mould,
when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by
force among their own people, I might be ill ufed for
my kindnefs to them, and make my cafe worfe than it
was before. 
He anfv.vred with a great deal of candour and inge-
nuity, that their condition was fo miLn able, and they
were fo fenfible of it, that he believe ! they would abhor
the thought of tiling any man unkindly that mould con- ,
tribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pieaftd, he
would go to them with the old man, and difcourfe with
them about it, and return again, and bring me their an-
fwer: that he would make conditions with them upon
their folemn oath, that th*.y would be absolutely under
my leading, as their commander and captain; and thst
they thou Id Iwear upon the holy facraments and gofpel,
to be true to me, and -go to f udi cnliiaii country as I
fhould agree to, and no other; p.nd to be directed wholly
and abfoiutely by my orders till they were landed f/.ffiy
in fuch country as I intended ; and that he would bring a
contract from them under their hands for that pir r ofe.
Then he told mc, he would fiiil Avear iooichiuu^h
 
 
 
 
that he would never ftir from me as long as he lived,
till I gave him order; and that 1 e would take my fide
to the laft drop of blood, if there mould happen the
lead breach of faith among his countrymen,
He told me, they were all of them very civil honeft
men, and they were under the greateft diftrefs imagin-
able, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and difcretion of the fayages ,* out of
all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and
that he was fure, if I would undertake their relief, they
would live and die by me.
Upon thefe afliirances, I refolved to venture to relieve
them, if poffible, and to fend the old favage and this
Spaniard over to them to treat: but when he hd gotten
ali things in readinefs to go, the Spaniardhimfelf ftarted
an O' jeclion, which had f© much prudence in it on one
hand, and fo much fincerity on th-?. other hand, thst I
could not but be very well fitisfied in it; and, by his
advice, put off the d liveranee of his comrades for at
lealr half a year. The cafe was thus:
He had been with us now about a month; during
which time I had let him fee in what manner I had pro-
vided, with the aliiftance of Providence, for my fupport;
ani he faw evidently what flock of corn and rice I had
lain up; which, as it was more than fufficient for my-
ft If, fo it was not fufficient, at lea ft, without good hus-
bandry, for my family, now it was increafed to number
four: but much lefs would it be fufficient, if his coun-
trymen, who were, as he laid, fourteen ftill ai ve,
fhould come over; and leaft of all would it be fufficient
to virtual our veffel, if we fliould build one, for a voyage
to any ak the chriftian colonies of America. So he told
me? he - bought it would be moreadvifeable, to let him
and the other two dig and cultivate feme mere land, as
much as I could fpare feed to fow; and tlut we fhould
wait another har/eft, that we might have a fupply of
corn for his countrymen when they fhould come; for
want v ight be a temptation to them to cifagree, or not
to think themfelvcs delivered, otherwife than out of one
difficulty into * no-: her : yen know, fay?he, thee! J Id rent
of Ifeu, though -hey re joi: ed r.t ftrft at their being deli-
vered oiu of Egypt, yet reUikdevea agai^nft G odhimf If,
 
that delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wildernefs.
His caution was fo feafonable, and his advice fo good,
that I could not but be very well pleafed with his propo-
fal, as well as I was fatisfied with his fidelity: fo we fell
to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools
we were furnifhedwith permitted; and in about a month's
time, by the end of which it was feed time, we had got-
ten as much land cured and trimmed up as we fowed
twenty-two bulhels of barley on, and fix teen jars of rice,
which was, in fhort, all the feed we had to fpare 5 nor
indeed did we leave ourfelves. barley fufficient for our
own food for the fix months that we had to expecl our
crop, that is to fay, reckoning from the time we fet our
feed afide for fowing; for it is not to be fuppofed it is fix
months in the ground in that country.
Having now fociety enough, and our number being
futficient to put us out of fear of the favages, if they had
come, unlefs their number had been very great, we went
freely all over the ifland, where ever we found occafion;
and as here we had our efcape or deliverance upon our
thoughts, it was impolTible, at leaft for me, to have the
means of it out of mine; to this purpofe, I marked out
feveral trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I fet
Friday and his father to cutting them down; and then I
caufed the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on
that affair, to overfee and diredl their works: I fhewed
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large
tree into fmgle planks, and I caufed them to do the like
till they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from
two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour
it took up, any one may imagine.
At the fame time I contrived to increafe my little flock
of tame goats as much as I could; and to this purpofe I
made Friday and the Spaniard to go out one day, and my-
felf, with Friday, the next day, for we took* our turns:
and by this means we got about tvve*:ty young kids to
breed up with the reft; for whenever we mot the dam,
we faved the kids, and added -them to our flock : but
above all, the feafon for curing the grapes coming on, I
caufed fuch a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the
 
 
fun, that I believe, had we hern at Alicant, where the
ratios of the fun are cured, we ihould have filled fixty or
eighty barrels; and thefe with our bread, was a great
part of our food, and very good living too, I allure you;
for it is an exceeding nouriihing food.
It was now harveft, and our crop in good order; It
was not the moil plentiful increafe I ho I fcen in the illand,
hut, however, it was enough to anfwer our end; for from
twenty-two bufhels of barley, we brought in and threfhed
out above two hundred and twenty bufhels, and the like
in proportion of the rice, which was tfore enough for
our food to the next harveft, though all the ftxteen Spa-
niards had been on fhore with me; or, if we had been
ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have vic-
tualled our fnip, to have carried us to any part of the
world, that is to fay, of America. When we had thus
houfed and fecured our magazine of corn, we fell to work
to make more wicker-work ; viz. great bafkets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very ha.Kly and dex-
trous at this part, and often blamed me, that I did not
make fome things for defence, of this kind of work; but
I faw no need of it: and now having a fully fupply of
food for all the guefls expecled, I gave the Spaniard
leave to go over to the main, to fee what he could do
with thole he left behind him there; I gave him a lhicl
charge in writing not to bring any man with him, who
would not firft {wear in the prefence cf himfelf and of
the old favage, that he would no way injure, fight with,
or attack the perfon he mould find in the ifland, who was
fo kind to fend for them in order to their deliverance;
but that they would (land by and defend him againit all
fuch attempts; and where ever they went, would be en-
tirely under, and fubjeclecl to his command; and that
this ihould be put in writing, and fxgned with their
hands: how we were to have this done, when I knew
they had neither pen or ink, that indeed, was a ques-
tion which we never afked.
Under thefe initruclions, the Spaniard, and the old
favage (the father of Friday) went away in one of the
canoes, which they might be faid to come in, or rather
were brought in, when they came as prifoners to be de-
voured by the fovages.
I gave
 
I gave each of them a mufquet with a firelock on it,
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them to be very good hufbands of both, and not to uie
cither of them but upon urgent occafion.
This was a chearful work, being the firfr meaning
tifedby me in view of my deliverance for now 27 ye:;r-
and fome days; T gave them provifions of bread, and of
dried grapes, fuincicmt for therrfelves for many day?, and
fufheient for their countrymen for about eight days time;
and withing them a good voyage, I let them go, agree-
ing with them about a fignalthey mould hangout at their
return, by which I fhould know them again, when they
came back, at adiftancc, before they came on more.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that the
moon was at the full; by my account in the month of
Oclober; but ns for the exact reckoning of days, after I
had once loft it, I could never recover it again; nor h id
I kept even the number of years fo punctually, as to be
fure that I was right, though, as it proved, when I'after-
wards examined my account, I found I had kept a true
reckoning of years.
It was no lefs than eight days I waited for them, when
a ftrange and unforefcen accident intervened, of which
the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in hiflory. I
was fad afleep in my hatch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, Mailer,
mailer, they are come, they are come.
J jumped up, and, regardlefr of danger, I went out
a? foon a? I could get my clothes on, through my little
grove, which (by the way) was by this tinv: grown to
be a very thick wood:' I fiy, regardlefs of dinger, I
went without my arms, which was not my cullom to d:»;
but I was furprifed, when turning my eyes to the fea^ I
prefentlv £uv a boat at about a league and an halPs dis-
tance, ftanding in for the more, with a fhouldcr-or-
mutton fail, a.3 they call it, and tee wind blowing pretty
fair to bring them in; alio I obferved prefentlv, that tr^-y
did not come from that fide which the more lay on, but
from the fouthermoft end of the ifland: upon this I
called Friday in, and bid him Heciofe, forthefe were not
the people we looked for, and that wa did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies.
In
 
 
In the next, place, I went in to fetch my prcfpecHve-
gbfi-, to fee what I ecu Id make of them ; and having
taken the ladder out, 1 climbed up to the top of the hill ,
a:. I ufed to do when I was apprehenfive of anything,
at id to take my view the plainer without being dis-
covered.
I had fearcc fet my foot on the lull, when my eye
plainly dikovered a fh*p lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's dhiance from me, S. S. E. but
not above a league and an half from the fnc re, By my
obfervation it appeared pi airily to be an Engllfh ihip,
and the boat appeared to be an EngUfla long-boat,
i cannot exprefs the confufion i was in, though the
joy of feeing a Clip, and one whom 1 had reafon to
believe was manned by my own countrymen, and confe-
quently friends, was fuch as I cannot deferibe; but yet
I had. fome fecret doubts hung about me, I cannot tell
from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my
guard. In the firit place, it occurred to me to eonfider
whatbufinefs an EngHfh fhtp could have in that part of
the world; fmce it was not the way tar or from any
part of the world where the Englifn had any trafhek;
and I knew there had been no ftorms to drive them in
there, as in diflrefs; and that if they were Englifh really,
it was molt probable, that they we~e here upon no good
defign; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall
into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man defpife the fecret hints and notices of
danger, which fometiraes are given him when he may
think there is no poihbiiiiy cf its being real. That fuch
hmts and notices are given us, I believe few that
tave made, any obfervations of things can deny; that
they are c'Ttahi difcover.es of an invifible world, and
a converfe of fpirits, we c.?.nnot doubt; and if the
tendency of them feems to be to \s am us of dan-
ger, why mould we not fuppofe they are from fome
friendly agent (whether fupreme, or inferior and fubor-
toate, i/'not the queftion) and that they are gieen for
our good?
The prefent quellion abundantly confirms me in the
jufhee of this reafonin^; for had 1 not been made cau-
cus by this fecret admonition, come from whence it
will,
 
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far v/orfc
condition than before, as you will fee prefently.
i had not kept myieli long in this pofture, but I few
the boat draw near the (Lore, as if they looked for a
creek to thurft in at for the convenience of landing; how-
ever, as they did not come quite far enough, th*y did
not fee the little inlet where 1 formerly landed my rafts,
but run their boat on fhore upon the beach, at about
half a mile from me, which was very happy for me;
for otherwife they would have landed juft, as I may
fay, at my door, and would have foon beaten me out
of my cattle* and, perhaps,, have plundered me of all
I had.
When they were on more, I was fully fatisfied they
were Englifhmen, at leaft moil of them; one or two I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove fo: there
we're in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found
were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound; and when the
firft four or five of them were jumped on fhore, they
took thofe three out of the boat as prifoners: one of the
three I could perceive uttng the moft paffionate geftures
of intreaty, affliction, and defpair, even to a kind of
extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up
their hands fometimes, and appeared concerned indeed,
but not to fuch a degree as the firft.
I was perfectly confounded at the fight, and knew not
what the meaning of it ttiould be; Friday called out to
to me in Englim, as well as he could, O matter! you
fee Englilh mans eat prifoners as well as favage mans.
Why, faid I, Friday, do you think they are going to eat
them then? Yes, fays Friday, they will eat them. No, no,
faid I, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them in-
deed; but you may be fare they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but ftood trembling with the horror of the
fight, expecting every moment when the three prifoners
fhould be killed; nay, once I faw one of the villains
lift up his arm with a great cutlace (as the feamen call
it) or fword, to ftrike one of the poor men; and I
expected to fee him fall every moment, at which all the
blood in my body feemed to run chill in my vein?.
I wifced
 
 
I wifhed heartily now for our Spaniard, and the favage
that was gone with him; or that I had any way to have
come undifeovered within fhot of them, that I might have
refcued the three men; for I faw no fire arms they had
among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.
After I had obferved the outrageous ufage of the three
men by the infolent feamen, I obferved the fellows ran
flattering about the land, as if they wanted to fee the
country; I obferved alfo, that the three other men had
liberty to go where they pieafed; but they fat down all
three upon the ground very penfivc, and looked like men
in defpahv
This put me in mind of the firft time when I came
on more, and began to look about me; how I gave my-
felf over for loft, how wildly I looked round me, what
dreadful apprehenfions I had, and how I lodged in the
tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beafts.
As I knew nothing that night of the (apply I was to
receive by the providential driving of the {hip nearer the
land, by the ftorms and tides, by which I have fince
been fo long nourifhed and fupported; fo thefe three poor
defoJate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance
and fupply they were, how near it was to them, and
how effectually and really they were in a condition of
fafety, at the fame time they thought tnemfelves loft,
and their cafe defperate.
So little do we fee before us in the world, and fo
much reafon have we to depend chearfully upon the
great maker of the world, that he does not leave his
creatures fo abfohitely, defHtute, hut that in the worft
circumftances they have always fomething to be thank-
ful lor, and fometimes are nearer their deliverance than
they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliver-
ance by "the means by which they feem to be brought
to their defiru&ion.
It was jiifl at the top of high-water 'when thefe
people came on more, and while partly they flood
Pa*l}ing with the prifoners they brought, and partly
whiie they rambled about to fee what kind of place they
^ere in, they had carrLHy (hid'till the tide w?.s fpent,
and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat a ground.
They
 
 
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found
afterward*, having drank a little too much brandy, fell
afleep; however, one of them waking fooner than the
other, and finding the boat too fait a ground for him to
ftir it, hallooed for the reft who were ilraggling about,
upon which they all foon came to the boat; but it was
pail all their ftrength to launch her, the boat being very
heavy, and the more on that fide being a foft oufy land,
almoii like a quickiand.
In this condition, like true feamen, who are, perhaps
the leaft of all mankind given to forethought, they gave
it over, and away they ftrolled about the country again;
and I heard one of them iay aloud to another (calling
them off from the boat;) Why, let her alone, jack, can't
ye? .(he'll float next tide : by which I was fully confirmed
in the main enquiry, of what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myfelf clofe, not once daring to
ftir out of my caftle, any farther than to my place of
obfervation, near the top of the hill; and very glad
I was, to think how well it was fortified: I knew it was
no lefs than ten hours before the boat could bn on float
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might
be more at liberty to fee their motions, and to hear their
difcourfe. if they had any.
In the mean time I fitted myfelf up for a battle, as be-
fore, tho* with more caution, knowing I had to do with
another kind of energy than I had at firfi: I ordered Fri-
day alfo, whom I had made an excellent markfman with
his gun, to load himfelf with arms: I took myfelf two
fowling-pieces, and 1 gave him three mufquets : my figure,
indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-fkiu
coat on, with the great cap 1 mentioned, a naked f.vord,
two piitois in my belt, and a gun upon each moulder.
It was my defign, as I faid above, not to have made
any attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found that in fnort they
were all gone ftraggling into the- woods, and, as I
thought, were all laid down to fleep: the three poor
diftrefied men, too anxious for their condition to get
any fleep, were however fet down under the Inciter ot
a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, ana
as I thought, out of fight of any of the reft.
 
 
 
Upon this i refolved to difcover my felf to them, and learn
fcmething of their condition ; immediately I marched in
the figure above, my man Friday at a good diftance be-
hind me, as formidable-for his arms as 1, but not mak-
ing quite fo daring a fpe£re-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then,
before any of them law me, I called aloud to them in
Spanifh, What are ye, Gentlemen?
They ftertcd up at the noife, but were ten times more
confounded when they faw me, and the uncouth figure-
that 1 made : they made no anfwer at all, but 1 thought
I perceived them juft going to fly from me, when I fpoke
to them in Englifh: Gentlemen, faid I. do not be furpifed
at me; perhaps you mav have a friend near you, when
you did not expect it: He muft be fent directly from
heaven then, faid one of them very gravely to me, and
pulling off his hat at the fame time, for our condition is
paffc the help of man. All help is from heaven, Sir,
faid I: but can you put a ftranger in the way how to
help you? For you feem to me to be in forne great dif-
trefs: I faw you when you landed; and when you
feemed to make application to the brutes that came with
you, I faw one of them lift up his fword to kill you.
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one aftonifhed, returned, Am
1 talking to God or man? is it a real man, or an angel?
Be in no fear rbout that, Sir, faid I: if God had fent
an angel to relieve you, he would have come better
clothed, and armed after another manner, than you fee
me in; pray lay afide your fears; I am a man, an Eng-
lithman, and difpofed to arM you, you lee ; I have one
fervant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us
freely, can we ferve you r—What is your cafe?
Our cafe, faid he, fir, is too long to tell you, while
our murderers are io near ; but, in (liort, fir, I was com-
mander of that fhip, my men having mutined again ft
me they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder rne,
and at hi?: have fet me on fhore in this defoiate place, with
thefe two men with me, one my mate, the oiherapaffen-
ger, where we expected toperifh believing the piace to be
uninhabited, and know not ytt what to trunk of it.
Where are thofe brutes, your enemies? laid I; do
you
 
 
 
you know where they are gone? There they are, fir, faid
he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my heart trembles for
fear they have feen us, and heard you fpeak; if they have,
they will certainly murder us all.
Have they any fire-arms? faid I: he anfwered they
had only two pieces, and one which they kft "n the boat.
Weil then, fa id I, leave the reft to me; I fee they are all
afleep; it is an eafy thing to kill them all; but fhall we
rather take them prifoners? He told me there were two
defperate villains among them, that it was fcarce fafe to
ftew any mercy to; but if they were fecured, he believ-
ed all the reft would return to their duty: I afked him,
which they were? He told me, he could not at that dis-
tance defcribe them; but he would obey my orders in
any thing I would direct :Weil, faid ], let us retreat out
of their view or hearing, left they awake, and we will
refolve farther; fo they willingly went back with me, till
the woods covered us from them.
Look you, fir, faid I, if I venture upon your delive-
rance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?
He anticipated my propofals, by telling me, that both
he and the (hip, if recovered, mould be wholly directed
and commanded by me in every thing; and if the fhip
was not recovered, he would live and die with me in
what part of the world foever I would fend him; and
the two other men faid the fame.
Well, faid I, my conditions are but two: i. That
while you ftay on this ifland with me, you will not pre-
tend to any authority here; and if I put arms into yuur
hands, you will upon all occafions give them up to me,
and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this ifland,
and in the mean time to be governed by my orders.
2. That if the {hip is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England, paffage free.
He gave me ail the affurance that the invention and
faith of a man could devife, that he would comply with
thefe moft reafonabie demands, and befides would owe
liis life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occafions as
long as he lived.
Well then, faid I, here are three minuets for you,
with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is
proper to be done; he ft ewed all the teftimony of h<s
gratitude
 
 
 
 
gratitude that he was able; but offered to be wholly
guided by me; I told him, 1 thought it was hard ven-
turing any thing, but the heft method I could think of,
was to fire upon them at once, as they lay; and ii" a^v
were not killed at the firft volley, and offered to fuhniit,
we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon God's
providence to direct tin- fhot.
He f lid very modeftly, thit he was loth to kill them,
it he could help it; but that thofe two were incorrigible
villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in
the fhip; and if they ef apal, wc fhould be undone ftill;
tur*they would go on board, and bring the whole fhip'»
company, and deflroy us all r Well then, faidl, necellity
legitimates my advice; for it is the only way to fave our
lives. Mow-ever, feeing him ftili cautious of ihcdding
blood, I told him, they mould go themfclves, and ma-
nage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this difeourfe we heard fome of them
awake, and foon alter we law two of them on their feet:
I ::fkcd him, if either of them were the men who he had
f"id were the heads of the mutiny? He faid, No. Well
then, faid I, you may let them efeape, and Providence
items to have wakened them on purpofe to fave them-
fives: Now, faid I, if the reft efeape you, it is your fault.
Animated with this, he took the mufquet I had given
him in his hand, and piflol in his belt, and his two
comrades with him, with each man apiece in his hand;
the two men, who were with him, going firfh made fomc
noife, at which one of the feamen, who was awake,
turned about, and feeing them coming, cried out to the
ndi; but it was too late then; for the moment he crkd
out, they fired, I mean the two men, the captain wifely
referving his own piece: they had fo well aimed their
ftiot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the fpot, and the other verjr much wounded; but not
being dead, he flatted up on his feet, and called eagerly
for help to the other; but the captain, flepping to him,
told him it was too late to cry for help; he mould call
upon God to forgive his viliany; and with that word
knocked Him down with the flock of his mniquet, fo
that he never fpoke more: there we, c three more in the
company, and one of them was alfo nightly wounded;

ir-
by this time I was come; and when they faw their <k$t*
ge.r, .and that ii was. in vain to refill, they begged J or
mercy: the captnin told them, he would fpare thei
lives, if they would give him any aflhrance of thci • «u
horrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, aim
would fwear to be taithlul to him in rc<-o*a.-t ing the fnip,
and alter wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came; they gave him all the prou.fhtionj
€>f their fhkirity that could bedefhed, and he was will-
ing to believe then), and ipare their lives, which 1 was
not agaiuft; only I obliged them to keep them bound
hand and foot while they were upon the blind.
While this was doing, I lent Friday with the captain's
mate to the boat, with ordeis to feeure her, and being
awav the oais and fail, which they did; and by and bv,
three fledgling men, that were (happily for them) part-
ed horn the reft, came back upon hearing the guns
bred; and fecing their captain, who before was their
prifoner, now their conqueror, they fiibmitted to be
bound alio, and fo onr victory was complete.
It now remained, that the captain and I fhoukl enquire
into one another's eirc urn fiances: I began fix ft, and told
him mv whole hiflory, which he heard with an attention
even to amazement, and partk ularly at the wonder!ul
manner of my being furniihed with proviilons and am-
munition; and indeed, as my flory is a whole collection
of wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he refit etc d
from thence upon himfeif, and how I learned to have been
prefer ved there on purpofe to lave his lite, the tears ran
down bin face, and he could not fpeak a word moi e,
After this communication .was at an end, 1 earned
Inm and his two men into my apartments, leading them
in juft where I came out, viz. at the top of the houie;
where I refrefiied them with fuch provifions as I had,
and mewed them all the contrivances I had made du-
ring my long, long inhabiting that place.
All I Ihewed them, all I foid to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my lor-
tific-alien ; and how periectly 1 had concealed my ret. eat
with a grove of trees, which, having now been planted
near twenty years, and the trees growing much falter
than in England, was become a little wood, and fo
thick
 
thick, that it was unp.uTable in any put cf it, but at
that on:.: fine where I had referved my little winding
•|v.]iT-'<;ve in'o it: this I told him was my rrftle, and my
^ekdence; but th?t I had a feat in the country, as molt
princes have, whither I could retreat i:pon oc ailon, and
I won id fh.:w 1dm that too another tin v:; hut at pnf -nt
our luifineis was to oonrrk:r how to recover the fh:p:
he agreed with me as to that; but told nie, he was per-
fectly at a lot. what mrafure to take; for that there
were fHH fix and twentv hands on board, w!io hr.dng
entered into a cur fed conspiracy, by which they had r.i!
for,cited their lives to the law, would be hardened in
?f core by defberation; a:id would carry it on, knowing
that if they were reduced, they fhould be brought to the
gahows as foon as they came to England, or to any of
the Engfifh colonies; and that therefore there would be
no atia< kin*/, them with fo fmall a jiumber as we were.
I mrded for feme time upon what he had (aid, and
found ic was a very rational eoncJulion, and that there-
fo: ': form-thin^ was to be refolved on very fp:ed ily, as
we!) to draw the men on board into fome inane for their
iu.i'prize, r s to prevent their landing upon us, and de«
itro\ inc as: upon this it prefently occurred to me, that
in a jhrde while, the /hip's crew, wondering what was
her cm e of their comrades, and of the boat, would cer-
tain!) c ome on fkore in their other boat to lee for them;
and that then perhaps they might come aimod, and be
too ftn-a.g. for us: thn, he allowed, was rational.
Upon this I told him, the hrft thing we had, to do,
v r> to flave the boat, which lay upon the bca h, fa that
tb~y might nut carry her off; and, taking every thin:*;
out of her, leave her'lb far life!ef$ as not to befit to fvim;
accordingly we went on board, took the anus which,
were lift on board out of her, nul whatever eif we
foued there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another
of nun, a few bi feu it-cakes, an horn of powder, and a
treat lump of fugar in a pie~e of canvas; the fugar
was five or fix pounds; all which was very wcVome to
w, efpecially the brandy and fugar, of which 1 had had
none left for many years.
When we had carried all thefe things on f.iore (the
oars, niaft, fail, and rudder of the boat, were carried
L % away
 
 
 
away before, as above) we ki?ocked a great hole in her
bottom, that if they had come ftrong enough to mailer
us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the fhip; but my view was,
that if they went away without the boar, I did not mm h
queftion to make her fit again to carry us away to the
Leeward iflands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards
in my way, for I had them ft ill in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our defigns, and had
full, by main ftrength, heaved the boat up upon the
beach, fo high that the tide would not float her olf at
high-watermark; and, befides, had broken an hole in her
bottom, too big to be quickly flopped, <n nd were fat down
imifing what we mould do; we heard the fhip lire a gun,
and faw her make a waft with her ancient, as a fignal for
the boat to come on board; but no boat ftirred; and they
fired fevtral times, making other fignals for the boat.
At laft, when all their lignals and firings proved fruit-
less, and they found the boat did not flit", we faw them
(by the help of our glafles) hoift another boat out, and
row* towards the more; and we found as they approach-
ed, that there were no lefs than ten men in her, and that
they had fire arms with them.
As the fhip lay almoft two leagues from the fhore,
we had a full view, of them as they came, and a plain
light of the men, even of their faces; beeaufe the tide
having fet them a little to the eaft of the other boat, they
rowed up under fliore, to come to the fame place where
the other had landed, and where the boat lay.
By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the perfons and characters of all
the men in the boat; of whom he laid that there were
three very honeft fellows, who, he was fure, were led
into this confpiracy by the reft, being overpowered and
frighted.
But that for the boatfwain, who, it feems, was the
thief officer among them, mid all the reft, they were as
outrageous as any of the (hip's crew; and were, no
doubt, made defperate in their new enterprise; and ter-
ribly apprehend ve he was, that they would be too power-
ful for us.

Items to be but one thing amifs in all f.bq profpee'i of it.
What's that? fays he. \Vhy, f.iid I, 'th that, as you fay,
there are three or four honelt fellows among them, which
Ihould be fpared; had they been all of the wkkal part ot
the crew, I mouki have thought God's provid .nce had
fmgled thtm out to deliver them into your hands; for
depend upon it, every man of them that romes afho: e,
are our own, and. (hall die or live, a.s they behave toes.
As I fpoke thk with n ruhed \ oh e, and. rhcarfoi coun-
tenance, I fount! it gre.Uly encouraged him; fo we let
vigoroufly to our buhueis; we had, upon the fitfc ap-
pearance of the boat's coming from the Tiup, confidtred
of fepai ating our prifoncrs, and had indeed fecured than
effhclmdly.

out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding
their way out of the wools, if they could have d: Jivered
themfelves : here the*-' left em bound, but gave Vm provi -
lion*-, and promifed 'em, if they continued there quietly
to give 'em their liberty in a day or two; but that if they
attempted their efeape/thty fhbuld he put to death with-
out mercy. They prornifed f?itb.fully to b-tar their con-
finement with patience, and were very thankful that they
had fuch good ufage as to have proviiions, and a light left
'eni; for Friday gave 'em candles (fuch as we made our-
felves) for their comfort; and they did not know7 but that
he flood cent hie! over 'cm at the entrance.
The other prifoners had better ufage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, became the captain was not
tree to traft them; but the other two were taken into my
L 3 fervice
 
frrvio* upon their captain's reconamendath»n, and upon
their fohnn1}- enraging to live and die with us: fo,
with them and tin: tiircc iioneil men, we were fever, nicii
well armed; and I made no doubt we ihouki be able to
deal well enough with the ten that were a coming, con-
fidering that the r-r.pterin had faid, there were three or lour
honeft men among them alio.
As loon as they got to the place where their other
boat lav, they ran their boat into the beach, and came
all on iliore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was
glad to fze; for I was afraid they would rather have left
the I oat i t an an;!:or, fume difhnee from the flmre,
with feme hands in her to guard her; and fo we mould
net be able to feke the boat.
Being on more, the fir ft thing they did, they ran all
to the Other boat; and it was eaiy to ice they were under
a great fiirpnfe, to fhid her mapped, as above, of all that
was m her, and a great hole in her bottom.
After they bad mined awhile upon this, they fet up two
or three git.at fhoute, halleoing with all their might, to
try if they cor Id make their companions hear; but ah was
to no laarrde; then they came all. dole in a ring, and
iired a vollev of their fma!I amis, which indeed we
beau), and the echoes made the woods ring; but it was
ail one : thole in the rave, we were fit re, could not hear;
arm thofv in orr keeping, though they heard it well
enom;h, yet dnrft give no anfwer to them.
They were fo afhmiibcd at thefurprife of this, that, as
they told us afterwards, they refoived to go all on board
a; am to their fhip, and let them know there, that the
men vre e all murdered, and the long-boat fraved; ac-
cording, they immediately launched the boat again,
and got ?M of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even confer nd-
ed at this, believing they world go on board the fhip
"again, and fet fail, giving then comrades for loft, and
fo he ihould (fill lofe the fhip, which he was in hopes
we fhotdd have recovered; but he was quickly as much
frighted the other way.
They had not beenlong put off with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on more again ; but with this
new meafure in their conduct, which, it feems, they con-
 
felted together upon; viz. to leave three men in thu-
Ik-.'it. a 1 id the reft to go on Hi ore, and go up into the
<(uw;;y to look for their fellow?.
This w.is a i;n. at difappointment to us; for now we
were at a ink what to do; lor our fuzing thole ftwen men,
on fhore would be no advantage to us it we let the boat
ri'-ape. becaufe they would then row away to the ihin:
and then tlie veil or them would he fare to weigh, and let
Jail, and fo our recovering the (hip would be loft.
However, we had no ieinedy but to wait and ice what
the bf.;e oi thugs might prefcul: the feven men eanic
en Ihoi e, and the three who ixmained in the boat pat
her cUi*tu a .guod thihmce fi om d\c ihorc, and came to

hut when they were come to the brow of the hi!J.
where they could fee a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-eaft partr and
where the ill and lay low eft, they fhouted and hallooed
till they were weary; and not v.aring, it Teems, to ven-
ture iar from the Ikore, nor far from one another, they
fat down together under a t'-ee, to con (idea id* it: had
they thought fv> to hee-e gone to deep tkei e, a, the other
J^art.y of th: m lu.d done, they had done the j >b t-- u;
but rluy ware too full of apprehen^ons of ik\ngvvf to
venture to go to fh ep, though they oould u t tell what
the danger was they had to fear, neither.
The captain made a very juft pn-p/fd fo me upon
this <oufultatioii of theirs*; "'viz.1 that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to m ike
their fellows hear, and that we fhotdd ail tally upon
them, juft at the junchrre when their pieces were all
di/charged, and thev would certainly yield, and we
fnoukl have them without bloodflied; I liked the pro-
pofal, provided it was done while wt were near .enough.
 
 
 
 
 
to conic up to them, before they could load their pieces
again.
Bui this event did not happen, and we lay ftiil a long
time, very irrtrfolute what courfo to tike, at length I
told ther^, there would be nothing to be done in my
opinion till ni ht; and then, if they did not return to
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between
them-mid the more, and fo might ufe fomc flratagem
with them in the boat, to get them on more.
We waited a great while, though ver y impatient, for
their removing, and were very uneafv: when, after long
confutations, we faw them ftart all up, ;md n>a3rh d( wu
towards the fea: it feems, they liad fueh dreadful ap-
prehenhons upon them of the danger of the place, t!r*t
they refoived to go on i:card the fhip again, give their
companions over ior .lofr, and fo go on with their in-
tended voyage with the fhip.
A? icon as I perceived them go towards the more, I
imagined it to he as it really was; that they had given
over their lecuch, am! were for going bark again; and
the captain, as foon i>s I told him my thoughts, was
read}- to fhik at the apprehenfions of it; but I prdently
thought of a flratagem to fetch them back again, and
which anfwered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go over
the little creek weflward, towards the place where the
lavages r ime on more when Friday was rclcucd; and as
foon as they came to a little rifing ground, at about half
a mile's diitance, I bade the m halloo as 'loud as they
could, and wait till they found the feamen heard them;
that as fcon as ever they heard the feamen anfwer them,
they mould return it again, and then keeping out of
light, take a round, always aniwering when the other
hallooed, to draw them as far into the ifland, and among
the wood?, as pofiibb, and then wheel about again to
me, by fuch ways I directed.
They were juft going into the boat, when Friday and
the mate hallooed, and they pre fen thy heard them, ani
anfwering, rim along the ihore well ward, towards the
voice they heard, when they were prefently flopped by
the creek, where the water being up, they could not get
over, and called for the boat to come up, and fet them
over, *s indeed I expected. When
 
 
When they had fet themfelves over; I obferved that
the boat being gone up a good way into the creek, and as
it were in an harbour within the land, they took one of
the three men out of her to go along with them, and left
only two in the boat, having fattened her to the (tump
of a little tree on the Ihore.
This was what I wilhed for, and immediately leav ing
Friday and the captain's mate to their bufiueis, I took,
the reft with me, and, crofting the creek out of their
fight, we furprifed the two men before they were aware,
one of them lying on Ihore, and the other being in the
boat; the fellow on ihore was between fleeping and
waking, and going to ftart up, the captain, who was
foremoft, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and
then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a
dead man.
There needed very few arguments to perfuade a fingie
man to yield, when he faw five men upon him, and his
comrade knocked down; be fides, this was, it feems, one
of the three who were not fo hearty in the mutiny as the
reft of the crew, and therefore was eafily perfuaued net
only to yield, but afterwards to-join very flncereiy with in*
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate 10
well managed their bufinefs with the reft, that they drew
them, by hallooing and anfwering, from one hill taan-
other, and from one wood to another, till they not only
heartily tired them, but left them where they were very
fure they could not reach back to the boat before it was
dark; and indeed they were heartily tired themielves
alio by the time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in
the dark, and to fail upon them, fo as to make lure
work with them.
It was feveral hours after Friday came ha-k to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear
the foremoft of them, long before they came quite up,
calling to thofe behind to come along, and could alio
hear them anfwer, and complain, how krne arid tired
they were, and not being able to come any t^fhr, which,
was very welcome news to us. .
At length they crv." up to the boat; but it is impoftihle-
tc expreis their ce^aon, when they found the boar fait
L 5 a-giooijii
 
a ground in the creek. The tide ebbed out, and their
two men gone; we could hear them call to one another
in a molt lamentable manner, telling one another they
were gotten into an enchanted ifland; that either there
were inhabitants in it, and they mould all be murder-
ed; or cife there were devils or fpirits in it, and they*
mould be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names a great many times, but no anfwer:
rittr fome time, we could fee them, by the little light
there was, run about wringing their hands, like men in
defpair: and that fometimes they would go and fit down
in the boat to reft themfelves, then come afhore, and
walk about again, and lb the fame thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave to
fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to
tike them at feme advantage, fo to fpare them, and kill
as tew of them as I could; and efpccially I was unwil-
ling to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the
other were very well armed: I refolded to wait to fee
b thev did not feparate; and therefoi e, to make lure of
than, I drew my ambufcade nearer; and ordered Fri-
day iiiid the captain to creep upon their hands and feet
as cidfe to the giound as they could, that they might
not be diii ovei't-d, and get as near them as they could
eoilibly, l-d'ore they olfered to fire.
They had not been long in that poftnre, but that the
hoattVvdn. who was the principal ringleader of the mu-'
tiny, nnd had now lhewn himfelf the mod dejected ante,
di-'pinteJ of all the reft, came walking towards them
with two more of the crew ; the captain was fo eager, at
having the principal rogue lb much in his power, that he
con id h;;t\dv have pa..kavce to let him come fo near as to
be fure oi m.n; ?or they only heard his tongue before:
but when they cz: io nearer, the captain and Friday,,
darting up onYheir u;et, let fly at them.
The boatfwr.bi was killed upon tlie fpot; the next man
was fhet into the 1 ody, and fell juft ! y him, tho* he did
not die till an bom* or two alter; and the third run for it.
At the neiie oJ-the lire, .1 immediately advanced with
my whole army, which was now r ht men; viz. my-
ielf generaliiliiiio j Friday my lie^nant-general;. the

captain and his two men, and the three prifoners of war,
whom he had tndled with arms.
We eiinie upon them indeed in the dark, fo that thev
co1 ild not fee our number; and I made the man they had
left in the boat, who was now one of u^. to rail them by
mime, to try if I could bring them to a parley, ana fo
might perhaps reduce them to terms; which fell out Juli-
as we d-diced: for indeed it was eafy to think, as their
condition then was, they would be very willing to capinw
late; fo he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Torn Smith anfwered imme-
diately, Who's that! Rnbinfon! For it feems lie knew
his voice* The other anfwered, Av, av; for God's fake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yield, 01* vou

tain him elf then calls out; You, Smith, you know my
voice, if you lay down your arms immediately, and fu"li-
mit, you Ilia. 11 have your lives, idl but uili A duns,

that laid hold of the cap:du when tlicy /bit mutmed^
and ufed him baibaronfiv, in, tvinghK hands, and cpv-
ing him injurious language: how; .-er. the captain told

three, were ail but eight, came up and feized upon thenx

all , and upon their boat, only that I kept myfelf and
one more out of fight, for renfons of fiate.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of feizing the ibip; and as for the captain, now he had
leifure to parley with them, he expolhiJated with them
upon the villany of their practices with him, and at
length, upon the farther wickednefs of their deii^n; and
liow cert .-I j uly it muft bring them to mifery and diftreis
in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for
their lives; as'for that, he told them they were none of
his prifoncrs, but the commander's of the iiland; that
they thought they had fet him oji fhore in a barren unin-
habited ifland; but it had pleafed God fo to direct them,
that the ifland was inhabited, and that the governor was
an Englishman; that he might hang them all there if he
pleafed; but as he had given them all quarter, he fup-
pofed he would lend them to England, to be dealt with
there as juftice required, except Atkins, whom he was
commanded, by the-governor to advife to prepare for
death; for that lie would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
its*de fired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and
all the reft begged of him for God's fake, that they might
not be fenv to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a moft cafy thing
to bring thefe K tlows in to be hearty in getting poifef-
iion of the fhip; lb I retired in the dark from them, that
they might not ke what kind of a governor they had,
and called the captain to me; when I called, as at a
good diftance, one of the men was ordered to fpeak
again, and fay to the captain, Captain, the commander
cads for you; and prefently the captain replied, Tell his
excellency I am jufi a coining, i his more perfectly
amufed them; and they all believed, that the comman-
der was jaft by with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my pro-
jrctjor feizing the ibip, which he liked of wcndei fully
well, and revived to put it in execution ttic next morning.
Bat in order to execute It with'more art, and to be
•' fecure
 
feeure of luccefs, I told htm we moft divide the prifon-
ers, ana that he fhould go and take Atkins, and two more
of the vvorft of them, and fend them pinioned to the cave
where the others lay: this was committed to Friday, and
the two in en who came on fhore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prlfon; and
it was indeed a diiinai place, efpeciaily to men in their
condition.
. The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of
which I have given a full defcription; and as it was
fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was fecure enough,
couriering they were upon their behaviour.
To thefc In the morning I lent the captain, who was
to enter into a parley with them ; in a word, to try them,
and tell me,, whether he thought they might be trailed
or no, to goon board, and furprife the fhlp: he talked
to them of the injury done him, cf the condition they
were brought to; and that though the governor had given
them quarter for their lives, as to the prefent action, yet
that if they were fent to England, they would all be
hanged in chains, to be fure; but that if they would join
in fucli an attempt, a.-, to recover the fliip, he would have
the governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guefs how readily fuch a propofal wodhi
be accepted by men in their condition; they fell down
on their knees to the captain, and promised with the
deepeft imprecattens, that they would be faithful to him
to the -ait drop, and that they fhould owe their jives to
him, and would go with him all over the world; that
they would own him for a father to them as long as they
lived.
Well, fays the captain, I muft go and tell the govern
nor what you fay, and fee what I can do to bring him to
con fent to it: fo he brought me an account of the tcra-
per he found them ia; and that he verily believed they
would be faithful.
However, that we might be very fecure, I told him he
fhould go back again, and choofe out five of them, and
tell them, that they mould fee that they did not want
men ; but he would take out of thefe five to be his aiTul-
ants, and that the governcr would keep the other two,
and the three that wote fent prisoners to the caiUe, (my
leave
 
 
cave) as holhgcs, for the fidelity of thofc five; and that
if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hof-
tage:> iliould be handed in chains alive upon the more.
This looked fevcre, and convinced them, that the go-
vernor was in earned; however, they had no way left
them but to accept it; and it was now the hufinef; of the
prhoners, as much as of the captain,, to perfuade the
oilier five to do their duty.
Our ftrength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion: i. The captain, his mate, and paffenger. 2. Then
the two pri{oners of the full gangr to whom, having their
characters from the captain, I had given their liberty,
ard milled them with arms. 3. The other two whom
I kept till now in my bower pinioned; but. upon the
captain's motion, had now released. 4. Theie live rc-
leafed at; 1 a li; fo that they were twelve in all, be fides
five we kept prifoner.-j in the cave for hollagcs.
I af-.cd the captain if he was willing to venture with
thefe hand , on boa id the thip: for, as for m-? and my
man Friday, I did not thi.uk it was p opcr for 113 to- Mr,,
having feven men leit behind; and it was employment
trough fh-r i;s to keep them alunder, and fapply them
with vkiuals.
i\b to the five in the cave, I refolvcct to keep them
fill; but Friday went twice a day to then, to fuppTy
them with neceilaries; and f made the other two car. y
pro;* Tunis to a certain- dittanc, where Friday was to
lake iiT.
When I fliewcd mylelf to the two uodcj's, it was,
with tlie captain, v- Lo tel. J them, I was the p^non the
governor had ordered to look alter them, aud that it
was the governor's nleafare that they ihotildnot iiirany
where bat by my direction; that if they did, they ihoukJ'
be-fetched into the eallle, aud be laid in irons; fo that
as Wi never fuflkred tly;m to {ho me as governor,- fo I
now appeared to another p-:rf*m, and fpoke of the go-
vernor, the ganifoD, the- cuilte, and the like, upon all •
occafions*
Tiie captain now had no dltltc.ilty before him, but*
to farukh his two boatc, flop the breach of one, aud
man them: he made his pailanger captain of one, v.ith
four other men; and Limfeif, a:id his mace, and hve-
 
 
more, went in the oilier: and they contrived their bail"
nefs very well; for they came up to the* Ihip about mi U
night: as foon as they came vvi thin cail .of like iliip, he
made Robinfon hail them, and tell tiwm he had brought
off the men and the boat, but th.at it was a longtime
before they had found them., and the like ; holding them
in a chat, till they came to the ihip" s fide; when the
captain and the mate, ^entering firil with their arms, im-
mediately knocked down the fecond mrt e and carpenter
with the but end of their mufqucts, being very faithfully
feconded by their men; they fecured all the re it that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to
fallen the hatches to keep them down who were below,
when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, fecured the forecaftle of the fhip, and the fkuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prifoners.
When this was done, and all fife upon the deck, the
captain ordered the mate with three men to break into-
the round-houfe, where the new rebel captain lav, and,
having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and with two
men and a boy had gotten fire a^nis in their hands; and
when, the mate with a crow fp-.it open the door, the
new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with a muiquet ball, which broke
his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed,
nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rufhel, however, into the
roimd-houfe, wounded as he was, and with hk pi do!
mot the new captain through the head, the millets en-
tering at his mouth, and came out agam behind one of
his ears; fo that he never fpoke a word.; upon which
the relt yielded, and the fhip was taken efrc&ually,
without any more lives loft.
As foon as the iliip was thus fecu red, the captain or-
dered feven guns to be fired, winch was the n;;;md agreed
upon -with me, to give me notice of his fuccets; which
you may be fure I was very glad to hear, having kit
watching upon the more for it, till near two of the clock
in the morning.
H-u ing thus' heard the fignal plainly, I laid me down •
Sfend it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I heps
 
 
 
very found, till I was fbmething furprifed with the none
of a gun; and prekmly llarting up, I heard a man call
me by the name of governor, governor; and prcfently
I knew the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top
of the hill, there he flood, and pointing to the ihip, he
embraced me in his arms; My dear friend and deliverer,,
fays he, there's your fhip, for (he is all your's, and fo are
we, and all that belong to her. I call: my eyes to the
Hup, and there fhe rode within a little more than half a
mile of the more; for they had weighed her anchor as
foot) as they Were mafters of her; and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor jult againit the mouth
of a little creek; and the tide being up, the captain had
brought the pinnace in near the place where I fu ll landed
my rafts and fo landed ju'l at my door.
I was, at firlt, ready to fink down with the furprife:
for I faw my deliverance indeed vifxbly put into my hands,
all tilings eafy, and a large fhip juit ready to carry mc
away whither 1 pleafed to go: at firft, for fome time, I
was not able to anlwer one word; but as lie had taken
me in his arms, I held fail by him, or I fhould have
fallen to the ground.
He perceived the farprife, and immediately pulled a
bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial,
which he had brought on pnrpofe for me: after I drank
it, 1 fat down upon the ground, and though it brought
me to myfelf, yet it was a good while before I could
fpeak a word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an ec-
ftafy as I, -oaly not under any furprife, as 1 was; and he.
faid .a thouiand kind tender things to me,' to compofe
and bring" mc to my Calf; but liich was the Hood of joy
in my breait, that it put all my fpi- its into confufion; at
laft it broke into tears, and in a little wnile after I re-
covered my fpcech.
Then 1 took my turn, and embraced him as my de-
liverer; and we rejoiced togetta r: I told him, t looked
upon him as a tmn lent trom hraven to deliver me,
and that, the whole tran'aclbn fee-med to be a chain
of wonders; that fuch thines ;:.s thefe were the tef-
timonies we had of a f:cret hind of Providence go-
verning the world, and an evidence, that, the eyes of
 
 
an Infinite power could fearch into the rcinou-ii corner
of the world, and fend help to the iniicrabie whenever
lie pleafed.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfu'nefs to
heaven; and what hrart could f rbear to blefs him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for
one in fuch a wildernefs, and iri uiJ. a ddbht>c condi-
tion, but from wlicm every deliverance mail always be
acknowledged to proceed!
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me, lie
had brought me feme little refrrfhsienh, rt-;h as the
/hip afforded, and inch a? the wretchc;, who had been
fo long his .mafler^, hid not plbneeiv i him ..f: n^-n
this he called aloud to the boat. an J Lid I L njen b/i;,g
the things atho/e thai were for the gnveivo:-; a.,d indeed
it v/.u a prefent, as if 1 had been one, not thai was to be
carried along with them, but a5 if 1 had been to dwell
upon the ifiand ttitl, and they were to go without me.
Fir ft, he had brought me a crfe of bottks full of ex-
c llen.t cordial waters, fix large bottle" cf Madeira wine;
the bottles held two quarts apiece; two pounds of ex-
cellent eood tobacco, twelve goo I pieces of the Chip's
beef,, and. hx pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and
about an hundred weight of bi feu it.
He brought me alfo a box of fugar, a box of Hour, a
bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juke, and
abundance of other things: but befides thefe, and what
was a thoufhnd t imes more ufeful to 111?, he brought me
fix clean new ihistw fix very good neckcloths, two pair
of gloves, one pair of /hoes, an hat, and one pair of
ficckings, and a very good ink of clothes cf his own,
which had been worn but very little: in a word, he
clothed roe Lorn head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable prefmr, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumibnccs ; but never was
any thing in the world of that kind fo unpkafant, auk-
ward, and uneafy, as it was to nie to wear fuch clothes at
their frit putting on.
After thefe ceremonies pail, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began
to confalt what was to be done with the priioners we
had; for it was worth conlidering whether we might
* - •  * • venture
 
venture to take them away with us or no, dpeciallv two
of them, whom we knew to he incorrigible and refrac-
tory to the hr't d^rcv; an-A the camin fuo\ he knew
they were fuch rogues, that there was no obliging- them;
and if he did carry them away, it mult he m irons, a>
malm* tors, to he delivered over to jultice at the £r;t
Em;hih colony he could come ai:; and I found that the
captain fumf If was very anxicus about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he deilrcd it, I durft under-
v':!:c to brin-j the two men lie ipoke of, to make it their own
reaueft that he flmn!d icivr. thrri iipsntheuland : I mould
be \crf ghul of that, fays the captain, with all my heart*
WeiV'fud T» I will lend for them, and talk with them
for yon: fa I can fed Friday and the two ho It ages, for
they were now difchaiged, their comrades having per-
formed their pro mile; I fay, I caufed them to go to the
cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they wcrey
to the bower, and keep them there tin I came.
After feme time, I came thither drelied in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being all
met, and the captain with me, I can fed the men to be
brought before me, and i told them, 1 had had a full ac-
count of their villainous behaviour to the captain, and
how they had run away with the ihip, and were prepar-
ing to commit farther r'Mieries; but that providence
had enfnared them in their own ways, and that they were
fallen into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the fliip had
been lei zed, that fne lay now in the road, and they might
fee by and by, that their new captain had received the
reward cf his viMany ; for that they might fee him
harming at the van!-arm.
Tnat as to them, I wanted to know what they hr*l to
fav, why I ihould not execute them as parties taken in
the fait, a? by my cow million, they could not doubt J
had authority to do.
- One of them anfwered in the name of the reil, that
they had nothing to fay but*this, That when they were
taken, the captain promifed them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy: but I told them I knew
not what mercy to (hew them; for, as for myfelf, I had
refolved to quit the iiland with ail my men, and had
taken
 
 
 
taken paflage with the captain to go for Eo.glaml: amla«;
for the captain, he could not carry them to England,
other than as prifoners in irons to in ;-l It rei isr'
and running away with the ihip; the confluence (if
which, they mull needs know, would he the gallows;
fo that I could not tell which was bea for them, imlefj
they hat! a mind to take their fit.5 in the ifhmd, if they
dr fired that, i did not care, as 1 had liberty to leave-it;
.1 had fome inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could tbift on fhore. Thev feemed very
thankful for it; fa id they would much, rather venture ia
.fkiy there, than to be carried to England to be harmed;
fo J left it on that iffue,
ilgwever, the captain feemed to make fome difficulty
of it, as if he duril not leave them there: upon this J
feemed a little angry with the captain, and told him,
that they >vcre my prifoners, not his; am! leiar teeing f
had offered ihem fo much favour, j would be as good as
my word; and that if he did not think ft to confmt to
it, J would fet them at liberty as J found them; and If
he did not like that, he might take them again, if he
could cetch them.
Upon this they appealed very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly let them at liberty, and bade them retire into
the woods, to the place whence they came, and 1 wou'd
leave them fome fire-arms, fome ammunition, and fome
directions how they mould live very well, if they
thought lit.
Upon tub, I prepared to go on board the {hip; but told
the captain, that J would ilay that night to prepare my
tilings, and defired him to go on board in the mean time,
and keep all right in the Ihip, and fend the boat on more
the next dav for me; ordering him in the mean time, to
caufe the new captain who was killed, to be hemged at
the yard-arm, that thefe men might fee him.
When the captain was gone, 1 lent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered f erlonhy into diicourfe
with them of their circumflances: 1 told them, i thought
they had made a right choice ; that if the captain carried
them away, that would certainly be hanged: 1 (hewed
tnern their captain hanging at the yard-ana of the (hip,
and told them they had nothing te& to expect.
When
 
 
When they had all declared their willingnefs to flay, I
told them, J would let them into the ftory of rny living
there, and put them into the way of" making it eafy to
them: accordingly I gave them the whole hiitory of the
place, and of my coming to it; mewed them my forti-
fications, the way I made my bread, planted rny corn,
cured ray grapes; and in a word, all that was ncceffary
to make them eafy: I told them the Itory alio of the ilx-
teen Spaniards that were to he expected; for whom I
leU a letter, and made them promife to treat them in
common with thcmfelves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five mufquets, three
fowling-pieces, and three iworcb;: t had about a barrel
of powder left; for after the fir it year or two I uied but
little, and wafted none: I gave them a defer! prion of the
way I managed the geats, and direct-ions to milk and
fatten them, to make both butter and cheefe..
In a word, I gave them every part of my own ftory;
and told them, I would pre vail with the captain to leave
them two barrels of gunpowder more, and fome garden-
feed, which I told them the bag of pefls which the cap-
tain had brought me to eat, and bade them be lure to
few and increafe them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on beard the fhip: we prepared immediately to fail,
but did not weigh that night: the next morning early,
two of the five men came fwimming to the fhip's fide,
and, making a moil lamentable complaint of the other
three, begged to be taken into the ihip, for God's fake,
for they mould be murdered; and begged the captain to
take them on board, tho' he hanged them immediately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power with-
out rne; but after fome difficulty, and after their folcmn
prcmife of amendment, they were taken on board, and
were fome time after foundly whipped and pickled; after
which they proved very honeft and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, 1 went with the boat on more,
the tide being up, with the things promifed to the
men, to which the captain, at my intereeiuon, cauicd
their cherts and clothes to be added, which they took,
and were very thankful for: I aifo encouraged them, by
teilmg
 
 
 
telling them, that if it lay in my wj v to K-nd a veM to
take them ir, 1 would not forget them.
When I took leave of this illand, I carried on boar J
Jjpr reliques the great goat's (kin cap I kid made, m f
umbrella, and one of my pancts; alio J forgot not to
take the money 1 formerly mentioned, which had. lam
by me fo long U'elels, f?at it was grown rwiiv, or t?.r-
mflied, and could hardily pals for fiiver, till it hid been
a little rubbed and handled; and ado tie m jney I found,
m the wreck of the Spanilh ibip.
And thus I left the ifland the nineteenth of December,
as I found by the fhip's account, in the year1036. after I
had. been upon it eight and twenty years, two month.'.,
and nineteen days ; being delivered from the fecond cap-
tivity the fame day of the month that I firii made my
efcape in the Bareo lango, from among the Moors of
Sallee. #
in this vefTel, after a long voyage, I arrived in Eng-
land the eleventh of June, in the year 1687 ) having
been thirty and live years abfent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect 11:ranger to
all the world, as if 1 had never been known there; my
benefaelor, and faithful (reward, whom I had left in
trull with my money, was alive, but had had gre;?t mif-
f or tunes in the world, was become a widow the fecond
time, and very low in the world: I made Iter eafy as to
what me owed me, alluring her, I would give her no
trouble; but on the contrary, in grautuJe to her ter-
mer care and faithfulnefs to me, J relieved her as my
little Rock would afford, which at that time would in-
deed allow me to do but little for her; but 1 allured her,
I would never forget her former ktndncfs to me; nor did
I forget her, when I had fuiticicr.t to help her; as mail
be obferved in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkfnire; but my father
was dead, and my mother, and all the family extinct;
except that I found two tilbr% and two of the children
of one of my brothers: and as I had been long ago given
over for dead, there had been no provision made for me,
fo that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or afliit-
me; and that little money \ had, would no; do lb mucn
for me, as to fettling in the world.
I met
 
 
. 1 met with one piece cf gnitude Indeed, which I eld
not expect; and this was, chat the mailer of the ihip,
whom.I had fo happily delivered, and by the lame means
laved the ihip and cargo, h?vmg given a very handlers
account to the owners, of the manner how f had faved
the lives of the men, and the fhip, they inc ited me to
meet them, and feme other merchants concerned, and
z\V together made me a very hand fome compliment open
that fubject-, and a prcfent of a!mo*! two hundred pounds
lie i ling.
But after making ihveral reflations upon the circum-
Aanccs of my life, and how ihdc v ay tills would go to-
ward fettling me In the world, I reibivea to go to Liibon,
and lee if I might not come by fome information of the
Jt.ate in mv plantation in the Brands, and what was be-
come of my partner, who, 1 had rcalon to fuppofe, had
fl)i?"e years row giv en me over for dead.
With this view ] took (hipping for Lifbon, where I ar-
rived in April following; my man F rid ay accompany iv.g
me very honeilly in all thcte F*i-m>lmgs, and proving a
moll faithful fcrvant upon all cccanons.
When 1 came to .Liibon, I found out by enquiry, and
to my particular fatisfadiun, my old friend the captain
of the ihip, who fir it took me up at fea, off the fliore of
Africa; he was now grown old, and had left off the
fea, having put his fan, who was far from a young man,
into his fhip; and who fall ufed the Brafd trade. The
old man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly knew
him; but I foon brought myidf to his remembrance,
when I told him who I v/a-'.
After fome pailionaic eeepreiJIons cf our old acquaint-
ance, I enquired, you may be lure, after my plantation,
and my partner: the old man told me, he had not
been In the Braiils for about nine years; but- that he
could afiure me, that when he crime away, mv partner
was living; but the trustees, whom J had joined with him
to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that,
however, he believed that 1 wquld have a very good
account of the improvement of the plantation; for
that, upon the general belief of my being caft away ana
drowned, my truftees had given in the account of the
produce of my part of the plantations, to the procutor
Fifcalj
 
Fifcal; who had appropriated it, in cafe 1 never came to
claim it, one third to the King, and two thirds to the
monaherv ofSt. AuguiUne, to he; expended for the beneft
cf the poor, are! for the convcriion of tec indi.m.t to the
Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me,
to claim the inheritance, it would be reilored; only that
the improvement, or annual productic n, b. ing diifrdnHed
tochari'.eb'e life3, could not be reilored; but lie aifiKed
jy e, that the Me ward of the kieghi re* emu (fen: land,}
;.-ad the pro\cdore, or Howard of the monaderv, h:;J
taken great care ail along, that the incumbent, that is
to fay, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of
the produce, of which they received didy my moiety.
I a iked him, if he knew to what height of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation; and whether he
thought it niieyft be worth looking after: or whether,
on my going odthcr, I ihould meet with no obflruction
to my poffeiilng my juM right in the moiety.
He told me, he could not tell exaekly to what degree
the plantation was improved : but this hj knew, that my
partner was grown exceeding rich, upon the enjoying but
one half of it; and that, to the belt of his remembrance
he had heard, that the king's third of my part, which
was, it teems, granted away to fome other monandry,
or religious hoefe, amounted to above two hundred
moidores a year; that, as to , my being redored to a
quiet poflerfion of it, there was no queiHon to be made
of that, my partner being alive to witnefs my tide, and
rr.v name being alio inrolled in the register of tac country.
Alio lie told me, that trie larvivors of my two truflees
were very fair honefl people, ?. nd very wealthy, and he
believed I would not only have their afihtance for put-
ting me in pofVif on, hut would find a very cone.Lrable
fum of monev in their hands, for my account, being the
produce of i.Le farm, vvhile their father; held the trull,
and before it was given up, as above, which, as lie re-
membered, was about tweh e years.
I frewed nryielf a little con;e;eed and tineafy at this
account, and enquired of the old captain, how it came
to pafs, that the truiiees mould thusdiipolc or my eifects,
when he knew, that I had made my will, a.id had made
Mm, the Pcrtueuefe captain, my uiiivcriai uea*, ucc*
 
 
He told me, that was true,; .but that, as there was no
proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor,
until force certain account ihomd come of mv death;
arid that, beiides, he was rot willing to intermeddle with
a thin? fo remote: that it was true, he had re^iilered my
will, and put in his claim 5 and could he have given
any account of my being dead or alive, he would iuvs
acted by procuration, and taken poireJ.fion. of the ingenio
(fo they called the frtgar-houfe) and had given his fori*
who was now at the Brafils, order to do it.
But, fays the old man, i have one piece of news to
tell you, which perhaps may not be fo acceptable to yon
as the reft; and that is, that believing you were loft, and
all the world believing fo alio, your partner and trustees
did offer to account to me in your name, for fix or eight
of the mil years of profit, which I received; but there
being at that time, fays he, g/cat diiburfements for in-
creafmg the works, building an ingenio, and baying
flave?-, it did not amount to near fo much as afterwards
it produced: however, fays the old man, I mail give
you a true account of what i have teceived in all, and
how I have difpofcd of it.
After a few days farther conference with this aulient
friend, he brought me an account of the -fix hrit years
income of my plantation, figned by my partner, and the
merchant's truitees, being always delivered in goods;
viz, tobacco in roll, and fugar in chefts, bedides rnm,
melafles, &c. which is tlie confluence of a fugar-work;
and J found by this account, that every year the income
cotiiiderably increafed: but, as above, die diiburfcmcnt
being large, the fum at hrfi was final!; however, the
old man let me fee, that he was debtor to me 470 moi-
dores of gold, be fides 90 elicits fo fugar, and 15 double
rolls of tobacco, which were loft in his fhip, he hav-
ing been Ihipwrecked coming home to Liibon, about
eleven years after my leaving the place.
The good man then b egan to complain of his misfor-
tunes, and how he had been obliged to make ufe of my
money to recover his lories, and buy him a ihare in a
new ihip: however, my old friend, lays he, you (hall
not wunt a fupply in your necellity; and as foon as my
fon returns, you fhall* be fully fatisiied.
Upon
 
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me two
hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and giving me the
wrkings of his title to the fhip which his fon wa > gone to
the Brafik in, of which he was a quarter part owner, and
his fon another, he put them both in my hands for lecu-
rity of the reft.
I was too much moved with the honefty and kindnefs
"of the poor man to be able to bear this; and remem-
bering what he had done for me, how he had taken me
up at fea, and how gencroufly he had ufed me on all oc-
c^fions, and particularly how fmcere a friend he was
now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what lie
laid to me: Therefore aril: I aiked him if his circum-
flances admitted him to (pare fo much money at that
time, and if it would not irreighten him? He told me
he could not fey but it might irreighten him a little;
but, however, it was my money, and I might want it
more than he.
Every thing the good man faid was full of affection,
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he fpr ke. In
fhort, I teok one hundred of the moidores, and called for
a pen and ink to give him n receipt for them; then I
returned hi in the reft, and told him, if ever Ikklpofleflloa
of the plantation, I would return the ether to him alfo,
as indeed 1 afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of
fale of his part in his fon's fhip, I would not take if by
any means; but that if I wanted the money, 1 found he
was honeft enough to pay me; and if I did not, but
came to receive what he gave me reafon to expert, I would
never have a penny more from him.
When this was patted, the old man began to afk nie,
If he mould put me in a method to make my claim to
my plantation. I told him, I thought to go over to it
myfelf: He faid I might do fo if I pleafed; but that if 1
did not, there were ways enough to fecure my right,
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my ufe; and
as there were fliips in the river of Lifbon, juli ready to go
away to Bran!, he made me enter my name in a public
regifter, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that
I was alive, and that I was the fame perfon who
took up the land for the planting of the laid plantation
at firft?"
Vol J. 'M This
 
 
a66 AD.V ENTURES OF
This being regularly attefted by a notary, and a pro-
curation afhxM, he directed me to fend it with a letter of
hid writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the»
place; and then propofed my Haying with him till an ac-
count came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration; for in lefs than ieven
months I receiv'd a large packet from the furvivors of
my truftees, the merchants,, for whofc account I went
to fea, in which were the following particular letters and
papers inclofed.
Firft, There was the account current of the produce
of my farm, or plantation, from the year when their ,
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain, be-
ing for fix years; the balance appeared to be 1174
moidores in my favour.
. Secondly, There was the account of four years more
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the
government claimed the adminiftraticn, as being the
eHeels of a pcrfon not to be found, which they call Ci-
vil Death; and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increafmg, amounted to cruifadoes, which
made 3241.moidores*.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Auguftines ac-
count, who had received the profits for above fourteen
years; but not being able to account for what was dif-
pofed to the hofpital, very honeftly declared he had 872
moidores not diflributed, which he acknowledged to
ray account; As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing.
There was alfo a letter of my partner's, congratulating
me very affectionately upon my being alive; giving me
an account how the eft ate was improved, and what it
produced a year, with a particular of the number of
fquares or acres that it contained; haw planted, how
many Haves there were upon it; and making two and
twenty crofles for bleflings, told me, he had laid fo
many Ave Maria's to thank the Blefled Virgin that I
was alive; inviting me very paffionately to come ever
and take pofleffion of my own, and in the mean time
to give him orders to whom he ihould deliver my
effects, if I did not come myfelf i concluding with an
hearty
 
 
hearty tender of his friendfhip, and that of his fami-
ly; and lent me, as a prefent, feven fine leopards feins,
which he had, it feems, received from Africa by fome
other (hip which he had fent thither, and who, it
feems, had made a better voyage than 1: He fent
me alio five chefls of excellent fweetmea.es, and an
hundred pieces -of gold uncoined, not quite fo large as
moidores.
By the fame fleet my merchant-trultees fhipp'd me
.1200 chefts of fugar, 800 roils of tobacco, and the reft
of the whole account in gold.
I might well fay now, indeed, that the latter end of
Job was better than the beginning: Jt is impoflibfc to
exprels the flutterings of my very heart, when 1 looked
over thefe letters, and efpecially when I found all my
wealth about me; for as the Brafil mips come all in
fleets, the fame mips which brought my letters brought
my goods; and the effects were i'afe in the Tagus before
the letter came to my hand: In a word, I turn'd pale,
and grew fick; and had not the old man ran and fetcVd
me a cordial, I believe the hidden fur prize of joy had
everfet nature, and I had died upon the fpot.-
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was fo fome
hours, till a phyfickm being fent for, and fomething of
the real caufe of my illnefs being known, lie ordered
me to be let blood, after which I had relief, :md grew
well; but I verily believe, if it had not been eafed by
the vent given in that manner to the fpirits, I mould
have died.
I was now mailer, all on a fudden, of above 50 000 L
fterling in money, and had an ellate, as I might well
call it, in the Brafils, of above 'a. thoufand pounds a
year, as fure as an eflate of lands in England; and, in
a word, I was in a condition which I fcarce knew how
to understand, or how to compofe myfelf far the enjoy-
ment of.
The firfi thing I did, was to recompenfe my original
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been lint
charitable to me in my diftrefs, kind to me in the be-
ginning, and honeft to me at the end: I mewed him
ail ilm was fent me; I told him, that* next to the
M 2 pro-
 
 
 
providence of heaven, which dlfpofes all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which 1 would do an hundred fold: So I firft returnM to
him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then
I fent for a notary, and cnufed him to draw up a gene-
ral releafc or difcharge for the 470 moidores, which he
had acknowledged he owed me, in the fulled and firmeft
manner poffiblc; after which, I cauft ! a procuration to
be drawn, impowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my
partner to account to him, and make the returns by
the ufual fleets to him in my name: and a claufe in
the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to him
during his life, out of the eflects; and 50 moidores a
year to his fon after him, for his life: And thus I re-
quited my old man.
] was now to confider which way to fleer my courfe
next, and what to do with the eftate that Providence
had thus put into my hands; and, indeed, I had more
care upon my head now than I had in my filent itate
of life in the ifland, where I wanted nothing but what
I had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I
had now a great charge upon me, and my bufinefs was
how to iecure it: I had never cave to hide my money
in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key
till it grew mouldy and tarnifhed before any body would
meddle with it: On the contrary, I knew not where to
put it, or whom to trull with it; my old patron, the
captain, indeed, was honeft, and that was the only re-
fuge I had.
In the next place, my intereft in the Erafils feem'd to
fummon me thither; but now I could not tell how to
think of going thither till J had fettled my affairs, and
left my effects in feme fafe hands behind me: At firft I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was
honeft, and would be juft to me; but then Hie was in
years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be
in debt; fo that, in a word, I had no way but to go back
to England myfelf, and take my efFecls with me.
I was fome months, however, before I refolved upon
this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old captain
fully,
 
 
 
fully, and to fatisiacdion, who had been my former
benef^torr fo I began to think of my poor widow, whole
buPoand had been my firft benefactor, and (he, while it
was in her po wer, my faithful ftcward and initructor:
So the ihll thing i did, I got a merchant in Lifbon to
write to his. corr^fpondent in London, not only to pay
a bill, bat to go find her our, and carry her in money
an hundred pounds from me, and to ralk with her, and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her, fue fhould, if
I livM, have a farther fupph : At the fune lime I f*;it
my two irters in the country, each of them, an hundred
pound?, th-w being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circum .lances; one having been m:\ rried and
left a v- idow, and the other having an liuibani not To
kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relation* or acquaintances I couM
not yet pitch up'in one, to whom I durd commit the
grols of my flock, that I might go ay/ay to the Kraft I %
and leave things fife behind me: and this greatly per-
plexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone tc the Brand-, and have
fettled myielf there; for I was, as it were, naturalized
to the place; but I had fome little fcruple in my mind
about religion, which infenfibly drew me back, of which
I mall fay more prefently. However, it was not religion
that kept me from going thither for the prefer,t; and as
1 had made no fcruple of being openly of the religion of
the country, all the while i vat; among them, lb neither
did I yet; only that now and then having cf late the light
more of it than formerly, when I began to think of Irv-
ing and dying among them, I began to regret my hav-
ing profHVd mvadf a papill, and thought it might not
be the heft religion to die in.
But, as I have laid, this wa; not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Braids, but that really I did rot
know with whom to leave my effects behind m:; fo I re-
folv'd at lail to go to England with them, where, if I ar-
rived, I concluded i mould make fome acquaintance, or
find fome relations, that would be faithful to me; and ac-
cordingly I prcpar'd to go for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, I nril
(the Brafi! fleet being jult going away) refolved to .gtv#
M 3' anfvvexs
 
anfwers fuitable to the jufl and faithful account of
things I had from thence; and firft to the prior of St,
Auguftine I wrote a letter full of. thanks for his Jult
dealings, and the offer of the 872 moidores, which was
undifjxafed of, which I defired might be given, ;oo to
the monaftery, and 372 to the poor, :?sthe prior ihould
direct, defil ing the good Padres prayers for me, and the
like. - • 
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two tru flees,
with all the acknowledgment that fo much juflice and
honeily called for; as for fending them any pre-fen t>
they were far above having any occafion of it.
Laftly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his in*
ihiftry in the improving the plantation, and his inte-
grity in increnfing the ilock of the works, giving him
flruc'tkms for his future government of my part, ac-
cording to the powers I iiad left with my old pat! on, to
whom I deft red him to fend whatever become due to
me, till he fhould hear from me more particularly; af-
furing him, that it was my intention, not only to come
to him, but to fettle myfelf there for the remainder of
my life: To this I added a very handfome prefent of
feme Italian iilks for his wife and two daughters, for
fuch the captain's fon inform'd me he had; with two
pieces of fine Engiifh broad-cloth, the befl I could get
in Liibon, five pieces of black bays, and fome Flanders
lace of a good value.
Having thus fettled my affairs, fold my cargo, and
turn'd ail my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to go to England: I had
been accuilbmed enough to the fea, and yet I had a
ftrange averfion to go to England by fea at that time;
and though I could give no rcafon for it, yet the diffi-
culty increafed upon me fo much, that though I had
once fhipp.d my baggage in order to go, yet I alterM
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by fea, and
this might be one of the reafons: But let no man
flight the flrong impulfes of his own thoughts in cafes
of fuch moment: Tw o of the (hips which I had fiugled
out to go in, I mean, more particularly fingled out than
any other, that is to fay, fo as in one of them to put my
things
 
 
 
thines on board, and in the other to have agreed with
the captain; I fay, two of the is fhips mifcarried; viz.
one was taken by the Algsrines, and the other was cafe
away on the St.?rt, near Torbayy  and all the people
drowned except three; fo that in either of thofe vefl'e
had been made miferable, and in which moil* it was
hard to f.iy. *
Having been thus harraflbd in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, p relied me
eameftly not to go to fca; but either to ga by land to
the Groyne, and crofs over the bay of Bifcay to Rocheiie,
from whence it was but an eafy and fafe journey bv land
to Pari?, and fo to Calais and Dover; or to go up to
Madrid, and fo all the way by land through France.
In a word, I was fo prepoflbilcd again!! my going by
fea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that 1 refolvcil'
to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not la
hafte, and did not value the charge, was by much the*,
pleafanter way; and to make it more fo, my old captain?
brought an Kngliih gentleman, the Ton of a merchant
in Liibon, who was willing to travel with me: after•
which, we picked up two who were Englifti and mer-
chants alfo, ?nd two young PortugueG? gentlemen, the
lai'l going to Paris only; fo that we were in all fix of us,
and five fervants, the two merchants, and the two Porta*
guefe, contenting themfelves with one fervant between
two, to fave the charge; and as for me, I got an Eng-
Hhh failor to travel with me as a fervant, beiides my man
Friday, who was too much a itranger to be capable of
fupplying the place of a fervant upon the road.
In this manner I fet out for Liibon: and our compa-
ny being all very well mounted and armed, we made a
little troop, whereof they did me the honour to call me
captain, as well hecauie I was the oldeit man, as bc-
caufe I had two lervants. and, indeed, was the original
of the whole journey.
As I-have troubled you with none of my fea journals,
fo mail I trouble you with none of my land journal: but
fome adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey, I mutt not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us (Iran-,
gcrs to Spain, were willing to ftay fome time to fee the
M 4' court
 
 
 
 
 
court of Spain, and to fee what was worth obferying;
but it being the latter part of the fummer, we hauened
away, and fet out from Madrid about the middle of Oc-
tober: but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we
were alarmed at lcvcrai towns on the way, with an ac-
count that fo much (now was fallen on the French fide of
the mountains, that feveral travellers were obliged to
come back to Pampclunr, after having attempted, at art
extreme hazard, to pafs on.
When we came to F am pel una itfelf, we found it fo in-
deed; ami to me that had been always ufed to an hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could fcarce
bear any clothes on, the cold was irafufFerable; nor,
indeed, was it more plentiful than it was furjp'rifing, to
come but ten days before out of the Old Camle, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and im-
mediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains,
(b very keen, fo fevetely cold, as to be intolerable, and*
to endanger benumbing and perishing of cur fingers, and
toes, was very ftrange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the
mountains all covered with fnow, and felt cold weather,
which he had never feen or felt before in his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna*
it continued fnowing with fo much violence, and lb long,
that the people faid, winter was come before its time*
and the roads which were difficult before, were now
quite impafiable; in a wcrd, the fnow lay in feme
placer, too thick for us to travel; and being not hard
frozen* as is the cafe in northern countries, there was no
going without being in danger of being buried alive
every ftep: we ftaid no lefs then twenty days at Pampe-
lima; when (feeing the winter coming on, and no like-",
IIhood of its being better, for it was the fevereft winter
all over Europe that had been known in many years)
1 propofed that we fiioukl all go away to Fontarabia,
and there taking fhipping for Bourdeaux, which was a
very little voyage.
But while we were confidering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been flopped on the
French fide of the paffes, as we were on the Spanifh, had
found out a guide, who, traveling the country near the
head
 
 
head ofLanguedoc, had brought them over the moun-
tains by fuch way:;, that they were not much incommoded
with the fnow; and where they met with fnovv in any
quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to bear
them and their horfes.
We lent for this guide, who told us, he would under-
take lo carry us the fame way, with no hazard from the
fnow, provided we were armed Aifficicntly to protect uj
from wild beads; for, he laid, upon theie great fnows,
it was frequent for fome wolves to mew thernfcr.vs at the
foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of
food, the ground being covered with fnow: we told him
we were well enough prepared for fuch creatures as they
were, if he would infure us from a kind of two legged
wolves, which we were told we were in moft danger
from, especially on the French fide of the mountains.
He fitislied us there was no danger of that kind in the
way that we were to go: fo we readily agreed to follow
him; as did alio twel/e other gentlemen, with their
iervanti , fome French, fome Spanish, who, as I faid,
had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back
again.
Accordingly we all fet out from Pampciuna, with our
guide, cn the fifteenth of November; and indeed, £
was furprifed, when, inftead of going forward, he came
directly hack with us, on the fame road that we came
from Madrid, above twenty miles; when having pa/led
two rivers, and come into the plain country, we flmn-i
ourfclves in a warm climate again, where the country was.
plcafant, and no fnow to be fecn; but on a fudden, turn-
ing to the left, he annroached the mountains another
way; and though it h true, the hills and the precipice*
looked dreadfully, yet lie made fo many tours, fuch
meanders, and led us by fuch winding ways, we infen-
fibly parled the height of the mour tain:-, without hzlng
much Vie; timbered with the fnow; and all on a fadden
he mewed us the pleafant fruitful provinces of Langue-
doc and Gafcoigne, all green and t'ourimmg; though
indeed they were at a great diftance, and we had fome
rough way to yafs yet.
We were a little uneafy however, when we found it
fnowed one whole day and a night, io fail/ that we
M 5 could
 
 
 
 
 
could not travel; but he bid us be cafy, we mould foon
be pail it all: we found, indeed, that we began to de-
fcend every day, and to come more north than before;
and fo, depending upon our guide, we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our guide
being fomething before us, and not jutt in fight, out
jufhed three monlrrous wolves, and after them a bear,
out of an hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood ; two of
the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he been half a
mile before us, he had been devoured indeed, before we
could have helped him: one of them fattened upon his
horfc, and the Qther attacked the man with that violence,
that he had not time, or not prefence of mind enough^
to draw his pittol, but hallooed and cried out to us molt
luttiiy; my man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride
up, and fee what was the matter: as loon as Friday came
in light of the man, he hallooed, as loud as toother, O
matter! O mailer! But like a bold fellow, rode directly
up to the man, and with his pittol Ihot the wolf that at-
tacked him into the head. . .
Jt was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been ufed to that kind of crea-
ture in his country, had no fear upon him, but went
clofe up to him, and mot him, as above; whereas any
of us would have fired at a farther dittance, and have
perhaps either milled the wolf, or endangered (hotting;
the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than,
I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with
the ncife of Friday's pittol, we heard en both fides the
difmalieft bowlings of wolves, and the noife redoubled
by the echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there
had been a prodigious multitude of them j and perhaps
indeed there was not fuch a few, as that we had no caufe
f f apprehenfions
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that liaxl fattened upon the horfe, left him immediately,
and fled, having'happily fattened upon his head, where
the boifeofthe brS41e had ftuck in his teeth, fo that
he had net done him much hurt: the man, indeed, was
mptt hurt: for the nig in g creature had bit him twice,
tftce on the *rai* and the^ other time a little above his
knee;
 
knee; and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the
diforder of the horfe, when Friday came up, and fhot
the wolf.
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the noife of Friday's pif-
tol wc all mended our pace, and r'd up as fail as the
way (which was very diihcult) would give us leave, to
fee what was the matter: as foon as we came clear of the
trees, which blinded us before, we faw plainly what had
been the cafe, and how Friday had difcngaged the poor
guide; though we did not prcfently difcern what kind of
creature it was he had killed.
But never was a fight managed fo hardily, and in fuch
a furprifmg manner, as that which followed between
Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though at iJrll
we were furprifed and afraid for him) the greater! di-
version imaginable: as the bear is an heavy, clumfy
creature, and does not gallop as the wolf doc? , which is
fwitt and light; fo he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his. actions; firrl, as to men,
who are not his proper prey, I fay not his proper prey,
becaufe, though I can't fay what excefhVe hunger might
do, which was now their cafe, the ground being all co-
vered wit h fnow; yet as to men, he does not uiuaily at-
tempt them, unlefs they firft attack him: on the contra-
ry, if you meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle
with him, he won't meddle with you; yet then you muft
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road;
for he is a very nice gentleman, he wont go a irep out
©f the way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid,
your bed way is to look another way, and keep going
on; for fometimes, if you {top, and ftand ftill, and look
lledfaiily at him, he takes it for an affront; and' if yoa
throw or tols any thing at him, and it hits hiirr, though
it were but a bit of flick as big as your finger, he takes it
for an affront, and fets all other bivfinefs ande to purme
his revenge; for he will have fatisfadion in point of ho-
nour, and this is his hrft quality: the next is, that if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you night or day,
till he has his revenge, but follow at a good round rate
till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
«arne up to him, he was helping him o:F frcm his horfe;
M 6 for
 
 
 
 
 
for the man was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the
bJ! more thai the hnr.; when, on a fudden we efpyc.l
the Ix-nr come out of the wood, and a very monftrous oi:e
It was, the biggcit by far that ever 1 faw: we were all
a little furpri fed when we faw hira; but when Friday
faw him, it was eafy to fee joy and courage in the fel-
low's countenance : O! O ! O! fays Friday, three times,
pointing to Mm, O mailer! you give me te leave, me
makee te hand with* him, me makee you good laugh.
I vns {yrpvifed to lee the fellow fo pleated: You fori,
you, fild .f, he will eat you up. Eatee me up! eatee me
up! fays Friday, twice over again; me eatee him up:
me makee yen good laugh; you all ihiy here, me fhaw
you good laugh: fo down be fits, and gets his boots off
in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we call
the ilat ilioes they wear) and which he had in his poc-
ket, gives my other fervant his horfe, and, with hisgim,
away he new, fwift like the wind.
The bear was walking foftly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday, coming prettv near, calls to
him, as if the bear could unde riband him: Hark ye, hark
ye, fays Friday, me fpeakee wit you. We followed at a
diilance ; for new being come down to the Gafcoigne fide
of the mountains, we were entered a valt great foreil,
where the country was plain, and pretty open, though
many trees in it (battered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we fay, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great (lone,
and throws at Mm, and hit him juil on the head; but
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it again it
a wall; but it anfwered Friday's end; for the rogue
waf; fo void of fear, that he did it purely to make
the bear follow him, and mew us ibme laugh, as lie
called it. .
As foon as the bear felt the ftone, and faw him? he
tun $ about, and comes after him, taking devisifn long
iUides, and fhuffib-g along at a ftrange rate, fo as would
put4 an hoifc a middling gallop; away runs Friday,
and takes his courfe, as if he ia;a towards us for help;
fo we all rcfolved to lire at ence upon the bear, and de-
liver my man; though I was angry at him heartily for
bringing the bear back upon us, when, he was going
about
 
about his own bufinefs another way; and e{pcn:t)]y I
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then
runaway; and 1 called out, You dog, faid I, is this
your making us laugh? Come away, and take your
horfe, that we may moot the creature. He hears me,
and cries out,. No ihoot, no ihoot, (land ftiJI, you get
much laugh: and as the nimble creature ran two feet
fry- the bead's one, he turned on a fudden, on one fide
of us, and lleing a great oak-tree, f> for his purpofe,
he beckoned iv; to follow, and, doubling ids pace, he
gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or fix yards from the bottom of
the tree.
The bear foon came to the tree, and we followed at
a dillaiice; the firft thing he did, he ftopt at the gun,
fme.lt to it, but let it lie, and up lie fa ambles into the
tree, climbing like a cat, though fo rnonfrrons heavy;
I was amazed at the folly, as i. thought it, of my man,
and could not for my life fee any thing to laugh at yd,
till feeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer
to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out
to the fmall of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got
about half way to him: as foon as the bear got out to
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker. I la,
lays he to us, now you fee me teachee the bear dance;
jo he falls a jumping', and fir; king the bough, at which
the bear began to totter, but flood frill, and began to lock
behind him, to lee how be Ihould get back; then indeed
we did laugh heartily: but Friday had not done with him
by a great tLal; when he fees him (land in!i? he calls
out to" him again, as if he had Aippoftd the bear could
fpeak Engliih, What, you come no farther? Pray you
come farther. So he' leit jumping and making the
bough; and the bear, juft as if he understood what he
fai-C did come a little farther; then he fell a jumping
again, and the bear flopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him 0:1'
the head, and called to Friday to Hand* fl\!l, and we"
would (hoot the bear.; but he ci ied out earn? frly, O pray! *
O pray! no moot, me (hoot, by and then; lie would have
kid, by and by. Ho we ver, to ihorten the Itory, Friday
''• danced
 
 
 
 
danced fo much, and the bear flood fo ticklifh, that we
had laughing enough indeed, but flill could not imagine
what the fellow would do; for firft we thought he de-
pended upon making the bear off; and we found the
bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not get
out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fall with
his great broad claws and feet, fo that we could not ima-
gine what would be the end of it, and where the jell
would be at lafl. •
Eut Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for feeing the
bear cling fall to the bough, and that he would not be
perfuaded to come any farther; Well, well, faid Friday;
you no come farther, me go, me go; you no come to
me, me come to you: and upon this he goes out to the
fmallefl end of the bough where it would bend with his
weight, and gently lets himfdf down by it, Hiding down
the bough, till he came near enough to jump down on
his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up and
frauds till.
Well, faid I to him, Friday, what will you do now?
Wi.y don't you moot him? No (hoot, fays Friday, no
yet, me moot now me no kill; m flay, give you one
more laugh; and indeed fo he did, as you will fee pre-
fently; for when the bear faw his enemy gone, he comes
back from the bough where he flood, but did it mighty
leifurely, looking behind him every flep, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree: then,
with the fame hinder end foremofl, he came down the
tree, grafpin^ it with his claws, and moving one foot at
a time. very kifurely ; at this juncture, and j;:fl before he
could fet Ms hind feet upon the ground, Friday flepped
elofe to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear,
and mot him as dead as a flone.
Then the rogue turned about, to fee if we did not
4augh; and when he faw we were pleafed by our looks,
he falls a laughing himfe If very loud: fo we kill bear in
my country, fays Friday, So you kill them, faid f, why
you have no guns: No, fays he, no guns, but fhoot great
much long arrow.
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we
were ftili in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt,
and what to do we hardly knew; the bowling wolves
 
 
ran much in my head; and indeed, except the noife I
once heard on the fhore of Africa, of which I have fa id
fomething already, I never heard any thing that filled
Hie with ib much horror.
Thefe things, and the approach of night, called m
off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us we Ihould cer-
tainly have taken the ft in of this monftrous creature
off, which was worth faving; but we had three leagues
to go; and our guide haftencd us; fo we left him, and
went forward on our journey.
The ground was frill covered with fnow, tho* not fo
deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ra-
venous crea ures, as we heard afterwards, were come
down into the forefr, and plain country, prefTed by
hunger, to feek for food ; and had done a great deal of
mifeliief in the villages, where they fuprifed the coun»
try people killed a great many of their fheep and
horfes and fome people too.
We had one dangerous place to pafs, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country, we mould find them there; and this was a
fmall plain, furrounded with woods on every fide, and
a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to pafs to
get through the wood, and then we mould come to the
village wrhere we were to lodge.
I was within half an hour of (un-fet when we en-
tered the firil wood; and a little after fun-fet when we
came into the plain. We met with nothing in the firft
wooH, except that in a-little plain within the wood,
which was not above two furlong over, we faw five
great wolves crofs the road, full fpeed one after ano-
ther, as if they had been in chafe of fome prey, and
had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were
gone, and.out .oi fight, in a few moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched •
faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready pofhire; for
he believed thene wtiv more wolves a roming.
We.kept our arms fea'y, and our eyes about 119*
but we faw no more wolves til! we came through that*
wood, whi;h was near h If a league, and entered the
plain; as foon as we came into the pr in, we had oc-
caflon enough to look about us. Trie iii il object we met,
with
 
 
with was a dead horfc; that is to fay, a poor horfg
which the wolves had killed, and at lead a dozen of
them at work; we could not fay eating of him, but
picking of his hones rather; for they had eaten up all
the ft fh before.
We did rrnt think fit to difturb them at their feaft#
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday would
have let fly at them, but 1 would not fuffer him by any
means; for I found we were like to have more buiinef?
upon our hands than we were aware of. We wertf
not half gone over the plain, but we began to hear the
wolves howl in the woods, on our left, in a frightful
manner; and prefently alter we faw about an hundred
coining on direclly towards us, all in a body, and
moll of them in a line, as regularly as an army
drawn up by experienced officers: I force knew in
what manner to receive them ; but found, to draw oiu-
felves in a clofe line, was the only way: fo we formed
in a moment: but, that we might not have too much
interval, I ordered, that only every other man mould
fire; and that the others, who had not fired, mould
ftand ready to give them a fecrad volley immediately,.'
if thuy continued to advance upon us; and that then
thofe who had fired at fir ft, mould not pretend to load
their fulils again, but Hand ready, with every one a
piftol, for we were all armed with a fuiil, and a pair
of piitol, each rr.an; fo we were by this method able
to fire fix vo'leys, half of us at a time: however, at
prefent we had no nect.'^ty; for, uron firing the• firft
volley, the enemy made a full flop, being terrified, as
well with the r.oife, as with the fire; four of them,
beinu Ihot in the head, dropped; feveral others were
Wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the
fnow: I found they flopped, but did rot immediately
retreat; when upon remembering that I had been told,
tfcat the fierrift creatures were terrified at the voice of'
a man, I cawed.ail uur company to halloo as loud as
we could, and found the notion- not altogether niif-
taken; for, upon our ihout, they began to retire, and
turn about; then 1 ordered a. fecond volley to be fired
in their rear, whr h put then* to the gallop, and away
they went to the woods.
 
 
This gave us Ieifure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might Jofe 110 time, we kept doing; but we
had but little more than loaded our bthis, and put onr-
felves into readinefs, when we heard a terrible noife
in the fame wood, on our left; only that it was "farther
onward the fame way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the night began to
be dufky, which made it the worfe on our fide; but,
the noife increafing, we could eafily perceive, that it
was the howling and yelling of tbofe htllifh creatures;
and, on a fudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves, on our left, one behind us, and one on our
front; fo that we feemed to be fur rounded with them;
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way forward, as fail as we could make our horfes go,
which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
of the entrance of the wood, through which we were
to pafs, at the farther fide of the plain; but we were
greatly furpriled, when, coming near the lane, or pafs,
we faw a confufed.number of wolves {landing juft at
the entrance.
On a fudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the nolle of a gun; and, looking that way, out
rufhed an horfe, with a (addle and a bridle on him, fly-
ing like the wind, and fixteen or feventeen wolves after
him full fpeed; indeed the horfe had the heels of them;
but as we fuppofe, that he could not hold it at that rate,
we doubted not but they would get up with him at laft;
and no queflion but they did.
Here we had a moft horrible fight; for, riding up ta
the entrance where the horfe came out, we found the
carcafe of another horfe, and of two men devoured by
thefe ravenous creatures, and of one the man was no
doubt the fame whom,we heard fire a gun; for there
lay a gun juft by him fired off, but, as to the man, his
head, and the upper part of his body, were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
courfe to take; but the creatures refolved us foon;
for they gathered about us prefently, in hopes of prey;
and I verily believe there were three hundred of them:
It happened very much to our advantage, that at the
entrance
 
 
entrance into the wood, but a Tittle way from it, there
lay feme large timber-trees, which had been cut dowri
the fummer before, and I fuppofe lay there for carriage:
I drew my little troop in among thefe trees, and pla-
cing ourfelves in a line behind one Jong tree, I advifed
them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us, for
a breaft-work, ro ftand in a triangle, or three fronts,
incloling our horfes in the centre.
We did fo, and it was well we did; for never was £
more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in
this piace: they came on us with a growling kind of a
noife, and mounted the piece of timber (which, as I
faid, was our breaft-work), as if they were only milling
upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it leems, was
principally occafioned by their feeing out horfes behind
us, which was the prey they aimed at: I ordered our
rren to fire as before, everv other man; and they took
their aim fo fare, that indeed they killed fevera! of the
wolves at the firft volley; but there was a ncreiiity to
keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils,
thofe behind pufhing on thofe before.
When we had fired our fecond volley of our fuiils,
we thought they flopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came
forward again; fo we fired our volleys of our piftols,
and I believe, in thefe four firings, we killed feventeen
or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many; yet they
came on again.
I was loth to fpend our kit fhot too haflily; fo I called
my fervant, not my man Friday, for he was better em-
ployed; for, with the greatcfl dexterity imaginable, he
charged my fufil, and his own, while we we:e en-
gaged; but, as I faid, I called my other man; and, giv-
ing him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train, all
along the piece of timber, and ht it be a large train;
he did fo, and had but time to get away, when the
wolves came up to it, and fome were got up upon it;
when, I, fnapping an uncharged piflol, clofe to the pow-
der, fet it on fire; and thofe that were upon the timber
were fcorched with it, and fix or feven of them fell, or
rather jumped in among us, with the force and fright
of the fire; we difpatched thefe in an iiutant, and the
 
 
 
reft were fo frighted with th j light, which the night,
far now it was very near dark, made more terrible,
that they drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our la ft piftolstobefired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a fhout; upon this,
the wolves turned tail, and we fallied immediately upon
near twenty lame ones, which we found it niggling on
the ground, and fell a cutting them with our f words,
which anfwered our expectation; for the crying and
howling they made -were better underitood by their fel-
lows; fo that they fled, and left us.
We had, fidt'and laff, killed about thret-feore of
them; and had it been day-light, we had killed many
more: the field of battle being thus cleared, we made
forward ao-ain; for we had ftill near a league to go:
we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the
woods as we went, u vei al times; and fonutimes we
fancied we faw feme of t^m, but the ihow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain; fo in about an hour
more, we came to the town, where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arm'-; for
it feems, that, the night before, the wolves and fonie
bears had broken into that village, and put them in a*
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but efpeciaily in the night to preferve
their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was fo ill, and his limbs
fo fwelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he
could go no farther; fo we were obliged to take a new
guide there, and go to Tholoufe, where we found a
warm climate, a fruitful peafant country, and no fnow,
no wolves, or any thing like them; but when we told
our flory at Tholoufe, they told us it was nothing but
what was ordinary in the great foreft at the foot of the
mountains, efpeciai ly when the fnow lay on the ground:
but they enquired much what kind of a guide we had
gotten, that would venture to bring us that way infuch
a fevere feafon; and told us, it was very much we
were not all devoured: when we told them how we
placed ourfelves, and the horfes in the middle, they
blamed us exceedingly, and told us, it was fifty to one
but we had been all deftroyed; for it was the fight of
 
the horfes that made the v/olves fo furious, feeing their
prey; and that at other times they are really afraid of a
gun; hut they being excel7!ve hungry, and raging on
that account, the eagernefs to come at the horfes had
made them fenfclef, of danger; and that if we had not
by the continued hre, and at Lift by the ftratagem of
the train of powder, mattered them, it had been great
odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had
we been content to have fat frill on horfeback. and fired
as horftmeu, they would not have taken the horfes
fo much for their own, when men were on their
backs, 3s ythenvife: and withal they told us, that at
laii, if we had flood altogether, and left our horfes,
they would have beer: fo eager to have devoured them,
that we might have come, off fade, efpecially having
cur fire-arms in our hands, and being fo many in
number.
For my part, I was never fo fenfble of danger in my
life; for feeing above three hundred devils come roar-
ing and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing;
to flicker us, or retreat to, I give myfclf over for Jolt;
and as it war, I believe, I mall never care to crofs thofe
mountains again; I think i would much rather go a
thoufand leagues, by fea, though I were fure to meet
with a florm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of, in my
paiTagc through France; nothing but what other travel-
lers have given an account of, with much more advantage
thin I can: I travelled from Thouloufe to Pans, and
without any considerable ftay came to Calais, and landed
fafe at Dover, the fourteenth of January, after having
had a fevere cold f:afon to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had
in a little time all my new difcovcred cftate fafe about
me, the bills of exchange, which I brought with me,
having been very currently paid.
My principal guide, and privy c©unfeI!or, was my
good antient widttv, who, in gratitude for the money
I had fent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me; and I trufted her fo entirely
with every thing, that I was perfectly eafy as to the fe~
curity of my effects; and indeed i was very happy from
my
 
my beginning, and now to the end, in the unfpotted in-
tegrity of tliis good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my efRvh with
this woman, and fctting out for Liibon, and fo to the
Brafils: but now another fcruple cam-? in the wav, an«l
that was religion; for as i had entertained fome doubts
about the Roman religion, even while I was abroad, tfpe*
daily in my Mate of folitude; fo I knew there was no
going to the Bnifils for me, muchjefs !-*oing to fettle
there, unlefs I refolved to embrace the Roman Catholic
religion, without any rcferve; except on the other hand
I refolved to be a facrifice to my principles, be a martvr
for religion, and die in the inquifition; fo I refolved to
ftay at home, and, if 1 could find means for it, to difpofe
of my plantation.
To this purpofe I wrote to my old friend at Lifbon,
who in return gave me notice, that he could eahiy dif-
pofe of it there: but that, if I thought fit to give him
leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the
furvivors of my truftees who lived in the Brafds, who
muft fully underhand the value of it, who lived jaft upon
the fpot, and who I knew to be very rich, fo that he be-
lieved they would be fond of buying it; he did not
doubt, but I mould make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the
mora of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it to
them/ and he did fo; and, in about eight mouths more,
the {hip being then returned, he fentmc an account, that
they had accepted the offer, and had remitted 33,000
pieces of eight to a'correfpondent of theirs at Liibon, to
pay for it.
In return, I figned the inftrument of fale in the
form which they fent from Lifbon, and fent it to my cJl
man, who fent me the bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces
of eight for the eftate; referving the payment of icq
moidore? a year, to him, the old mar, during his life,
and 50 xuoidores afterwards to his fori for his life, whica
I had promifed them; and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent-charge. And thus I hive given
the firft part of a life of fortune and adventure, a
life of providence's chequer-work, and of a variety
which
 
 
 
which the world will It Worn be able to fhew the like off?
beginning foolilhly, but doling much more happily than
any part of it ever gave me leave fo much as to hope
for.
Any one would think, that in this ftate of complicated
good fortune, I was pa ft running any more hazards;
and fo indeed I had been, if other circumftances Had
concurred; but I was enured to a wandering life, had no
family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I
contracted much acquaintance; and though I had fold my
eftate in the Brafits, yet I could not keep that country
out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; efpecially I could not refill the ftrong in-
clination I had to fee my ifland, and to know if the poor
Spaniards were in being there; and how the rogues I
left there had ufed them.
My true friend the widow earneftly diflliaded me
from it, and fo far prevailed with me, that almoft for
feven years lhe prevented my running abroad; during
which time I took my two nephews, the children of
one of my brothers, into my care: the eldeft, having
fomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and
gave him a fettlement of fome addition to his eftate,
after my deceafe; the other I put out to a captain of a
ftiip; and after five years, finding him a fenfible, kold,
enterpriling young feilow, I put him into a good lhip,
and lent him to fea, and this young fellow afterwards
drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures my-
felf.
in the mean time, I in part fettled myfelf here: for,
firft of all I married, and that not either to my difad-
vantage or diflatisfacYion; and had three children, two
fons and one daughter: but my wife dying, and my
nephew coming home with good fuccefs from a voyage
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his importu-
nity, prevailed and engaged me to go in his lhip as a
private trader to the Kail-Indies: this was in the year
1694*
In this voyage I vifited my new colony in the ifland,
law my fuccefibrs the Spaniards, had the whole ftory of
their lives, and of the villains I left there; how at fir 11
they
 
 
they infulted the poor Spaniards, how they afterwards
agreed, difagreed, united, feparated, and how at hit the
Spaniards were obliged to ufe violence with them; how
they were fubjecled to the Spaniards; how hontftly the
Spaniards ufed them; an hiftory, if it wc,*e entered into,
as full of variety and wonderful accidents, as my own
part; particularly alfo as to their battles with the Carib-
beans, who landed feveral times upon the ifland, and as
to the improvement they made upon the ifland itfelf;
and how live of them made an attempt upon the main
land, and brought away eleven men and five women
prifoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the ifland.
Here I fhyed about twenty days; left them fupplies
of all neceflary things, and''-particularly of arms, pow-
der, mot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I
brought from England with me; viz. a carpenter, and a
fmith.
Befides this, I fhared the land into parts with them,
referved to myfelf the property of the whole, but gave
them fin h parrs, refpecti vely, as they agreed on; and,
having fettled all things with them, and engaged them
not to leave the place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brafils, from whence 1
fent a bark, which I bought there, with more people, to
the ifland; and in it, befides other fupplies, I lent feven
women, being fitch as I found proper for fervice, or for
wives to fueh as would take them: a* to the Engliihmen,
I promifed thera to fend them fome women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of neceilaries, if they would ap-
ply themfelves to planting which I afterwards could not
perform: the fellows proved very honed and diligent,
after they were mattered, and had their properties fet
apart for them. I fent them alio from the Brsfiis five
cowrs, three of them being big with calf, fome fheep, and
fome hogs, which, when I came again, were coniider-
ably increafed.
But all thefj things, with an account how 300 Carib-
bees came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations,
and how they fought with that whole number twice,
and were at firft defeated, and one of them killed; but
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at lafl a florm deftroying their enemies canoes, they fa-
mifhed or deftroyed ahnoft all the reft, and renewed and
recovered the pofletiion of their plantation, and ftill lived
upon the ifiand.
All thefe things, with fome very furprifmg incidents hi
fome new adventures ot my own, for ten years more, I
may, perhaps, give a farther account of hereafter.
