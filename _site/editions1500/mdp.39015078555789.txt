PREFACE.
If ever the story of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth making
public, and were acceptable when published,
the Editor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the life
of one man beipg scarce capable of a greater
variety.
The story is told with modesty, with serious-
ness, and with a religious application of evesfl^
to the uses to which wise men always applg
them, viz. to the instruction of other3 by this. -
example, and to justify and honor the wtsdgftt
of Providence in all the variety of our chrculn-
stances, let them happen how they wilL
The editor believes this narrative to lii^4
just history of fact; neither is there mf topjpjffii
ance of fiction in it: and tho' he is w^v&W&le

singular preservations the author met with, will
give it the name of romance; yet, in whichev-
er of these lights it shall be viewed, he ima-
gines, that the improvement of it, as well as
the diversion, as to the instuction of the read-
er, will be the same; and as such, he thinks,
y/ithout farther compliment to the world, he
does them a great service in the publication.
THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born at York, in the year 1632,
of a reputable family. My father was a native of Bremen,
who by merchandising at Hull for some time, gained a
very plentiful fortune. He married my mother at York,
who received her first breath in that country: and as her
maiden name was Robinson, I was called Robinsox
KreuTznaer: which not being easily pronounced in the
English tongue, we are commonly known by the name
of Crusoe.
I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was
a lieutenant colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but slain
the Spaniards: what became of the other, I could Bejer
learn.
No charge or pains were wanting in my education.—^
My father designed me for the law; yet nothing woujjd
serve me but I must goto sea,both against the will o£nw
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties oC
friends. One morning my father e$postul||g&F .

pressed, or forsaken, you may wish you had taken your
poor despised father's counsel.—He pronounced these
words with such a moving and paternal eloquence, while
floods of tears run down his aged cheeks, that it seemed
to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But this soon wore
off, and a little after I informed my mother, that I could
not settle to any business, my resolutions were so strong
to see the world; and begged she would gain my father's
consent only torgo one voyage; which, if I did not prove
prosperous, I $vould never attempt a second. But my de-
sire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother passi-
onately expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling me,
u That as she saw I was bent upon my own destruction,
^ contrary to their will and my duty, she would say no
<; more, but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased."
I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine, going along
with his father, who was master of a ship, to London ; and
acquainted him with my wandering desires; he assured
m« of a free passage, and a plentiful share of what was ne-
cessary. Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking
fttvewell of my parents, I took shipping on the first of Sep-
tember, 1651. We set sail soon after, and our ship had
scarce left the Humber a-stern, when there arose so vio-
lent a storm, that, being extremely sea-sick, I concluded
tfoe judgment of God deservedly followed me for my dis~
obedience to my dear parents. It was then I called to
tftfe good advice of my father; how easy and com-
ftiKabie was a middle state of life ; and I firmly resolved,
if-it pleased-God to set me on dry land once more, I
tfOuld return to my parents, implore their forgiveness,
and bid a final adieu to my wandering inclinations*
Such were my thoughts while the storm continued; but
these good resolutions decreased with the danger;. more
especially when my companion came to me, clapping me
©n the shoulder: " What Bob i" said he, u sure you wa^
*' not frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind?"
** And do you," cried 1,4% call such a violent storm a cap-
* ful of wind?" "A storm, you fool you," said he,u this
*• is nothing; a good ship and sea-room always baffles
li such a foolish squall of wind as'tttat: but you're a fresh
u .water sailor: Come boy, turn out, see what fine weather
* we have now, and a good bowl of punch will drowi>all
"your past sorrows/' "in short, the punch was raa4&|
was drunk, and in one night's time drowned both my re-
pentance and ray good resolutions, forgetting entirely the
vows and promises I made in my distress: and whenever
any reflections would return on me, what by company, and
what by drinking, I soon mastered those fits, as I derid-
ingly called them. But this only made way for another
trial, whereby I could not but see how much I was be-
holden to a kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind-bound with some New-castle
ships; and there being good anchorage, and our* cables
sound, the seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and
spent the time as merry as if they had been on shore. But
on the eighth day there arose a brisk gale of wind, whtcJk
prevented our tiding it up the river; and stiii increajslsif^
our ship rode forecastle in, and shipped several large seas-
It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
3clves, and I heard the master express this melancholy
ejaculation, u Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all
u lost and undone !" For my part, sick unto death, I kept
my cabin till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehen*
sions of our speedy fate made me get upon deck ; asMti
there I was affrighted indeed. The sea went mountains
high ; I could see nothing but distress around us j two
ships had cut their masts on board, and another wasfomid*
ered; two more that had lost their anchors, were fojcefl:
out to the mercy of the ocean ; and to save our lives we
were forced to cut our foremast and mainmast quite away*
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dr^aB**
ful condition? I was but a fresh-water sailor, and therefore
it seemed more terrible. Our shjpwas very good, but
overloaded ; which made the sailors often cry out, **. She
"would founder \n words I then was ignorant of.this
while the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the.
master and the most sober part of his men went to pray*
ers, expecting death every moment. In*the middle of the
night one cried out, "We had sprung a leak ;** anoihe$y

LIFE AND ADVENTURES-
or some dreadful thing happened, fell into a swoon. Even
in that common condition of woe, nobody minded me, ex-
cepting to thrust me aside with their feet, thinking me
dead, and it was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal given, they
ventured out their boats to save our lives. All our pump-
ing had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been,
had they not come to our ship's side, and our men past
them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, which after
great labour they go? hold of, and we hauling them up to
us got into the boat, and left our ship, which we perceived
sink within less than a quarter of an hour; and thus I
learned what was meant by foundering at sea. And now
tfy^men incessantly laboured to recover their own ship;
bti'f the sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that
they thought it convenient to hale within shore; which,
"With great difficulty and dangei\ at last we happily effect-
• eci, landing at a place called Crdmcr, not far from Winter-
ton light-house ; from whence we all walked to Yarmouth,
Where, as objects of pity, many good people furnished us
•with necessaries to carry us cither to Hull or London.
? Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not
return to my father; who, hearing of the ship's calamity,
* for a long time thought me entombed in the deep. No
jdoubt but I should have shared on his fatted calf as the
Scripture expresseth it; but my ill fate still pushed me on in
spite of the powerful convictioi>of reason and conscience.
Whea we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my
©.k! companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and speech
were altered, and injfc melancholy manner asked me how
I <p4»;. jteiiing his father who I was, and how I had made
tA&.VOJ^ge only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Up-
*d8which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said,
feian, you ought never to go to sea any more, but
f to take this for a certain sign that you never will pros-
& per in a seafaring condition." ct Sir," answered I,kt will
« y<ju take the same resolution ?" *' It is a different case,"
said hej " it is my e&lling, and consequently my duty;
"but as you have mate t|m voyage for a trial, you see
"what iil success Heaven has set before your eyes; and
"perhaps our miseries have been on your account, like
« Jonah in the ship of Tamkhh. But pray what are you,
« and oa what accouM did you go to sea'r'* Upon which
\ very freely declared my whole story : at the end of which
he made this exclamation : " Ye sacred powers ; what had
"I committed, that such a wretch should enter into my
"ship to heap upon me such a deluge of miseries!" But
soon recollecting his passion, "Young man,"said he, " if
a you do not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go, you
"will meet with disasters and disappointments till your
"father's words are fulfilled unto you." And so we parted.
I thought at first to return home; but shame opposed
that good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by
my neighbours and acquaintance. So strange is the na-
ture of youth, who are norashamed to sin, but yef asham-
ed to repent; and so far from being ashamed of those ac-
tions for which they may be accounted fools, they think it
folly to return to their duty, which is the principal mark
of wisdom. In short, I travelled up to London, resolving
upon a voyage ; and a voyage I soon heard of, by my ac-
quaintance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go
to the coast of Guinea. Having some money* and appear-
ing like a gentleman, I went on board, not as a common
sailor or foremost man ; nay, the commander agreed I
should go that voyage with him without any expence;
, that I should be his messmate and companion, and I was
'very welcome to carry any thing with me, and make tbc
best merchandise I could.
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my
captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends f&
Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent to me, the greatest
part of which my dear father and mother contributed to*
with which I bought toys and tribes, as the captain di-
rected me. My captain also taught me navigation, how to
keep an account of the ship's coursertake an observation*
and led me into the knowledge of several useful branches
of the mathematics. And indeed this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant; for 1 brought home £ve
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my ad venture, which
produced, at my return to London, almost three hundred
pounds. But in this voyage I was extremely sick, belf*j£
thrown into a violent calenture through the e^xeejssuve
heat, trading upon the coast from the latitude of i*fb*€» de-
grees north, everf to the line itself.
But alas i my dear friend the captain soon deJ^fcetTthifc.
Hfe after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to tftig ^ yet
I resolved to go another voyage with his mate^ itifllfr
now got command of the ship, This proved a very unsuc-
cessful one ; for though I did not curry quite a hundred
pounds of my late acquired wealth (so that I had two hun-
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the captain's wi-
dow, who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my misfortunes
in this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sail-
ing towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Sa-
lee rover; and in spite of all the haste we could make, by
crowding as much canvas as our yards could spread, or
our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and
•we had but twelve. About three in the afternoon there
was a desperate engagement, wherein many were killed
and wounded on both sides; but finding ourselves over-
powered with numbers, our ship disabled, and ourselves
too impotent to have the least hopes of success, we were
forced to surrender; and accordingly were all carried pri-
soners into the port of Salee. Our men were sent to the
Emperor's court to be sold there ; but the pirate captain
taking notice of me, kept me to be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable-
creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father came
afresh into my thoughts. However, my condition was bet-
ter than I thought it to be, as soon will appear. Some
hopes indeed I had that my new patron would go to sea*
again, where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portu-
guese man of war, and then I should be set at liberty. But,
in this I was mistaken ; for he never took me with him,
bat left me to look after his little garden, and do the drud-
gery of his house, and when he returned from sea, would
make me lie in the cabin, and look after the ship. I had
Do one that I could linnmunicutc my thoughts to, which
were continually meditating my escape; no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman here, but myself; and for two
years T could see nothing practicable, but only pleased
myseli with the imaginati6n.
After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew
so poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual; and
then he used constantly, once or twice a w etk, if the wea-
ther was fair,.to go out a fishing, taking me and a young
Moresco boy to row the boat; and so much pleased was
he with me for my dexterity in catching the fish, that
he would often send me with a Moor, who was one of
his kinsmen, and the Moresco youth, to catch a dish of
fish Ujy him.
11
One morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such
a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore ; and rowing we
knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length, and made
the greater haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly
sharp and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to buiid a little
state room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a
place behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet, with
other conveniences to keep him from the weather, as also
lockers to put in all manner of provisions, with a hand-
some shoulder of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a fishing; and one
time inviting two or three persons of distinction to go with
him, made provision extraordinary, providing also three
fusees with powder and shot, that they might have some
sport at fowling along the sea-coast- The next morning,
the boat was made clean, her ancient and pendants out,
and every thing ready ; but their minds altering, my pa-
tron ordered us to go a fishing, for that his guests would
certainly sup with him that night.
* And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed- la ,
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions
on board, as not daring to meddle with our patron's ; and
heiaking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk biscuit*,
and three jars of water. Resides, I privately conveyed
into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a
hammer, hatchet and a saw ; and, in particular, some
bees-wax, which was a great comfort to me, and served to
make candles. I then persuaded Muley (for so was the
Moor called) to. procure some powder and shot* pretend-
ing to kill sea-curleus, which* he innocently and readily a-
greed to. In short, being provided with all things neces-
sary, we sailed out, resolving for my own part to make my
escape, though it should cost me my life.
When we had passed the castle, we fell a fishing; but
though I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the matter
in order to put further out to sea. Accordingly we ran "a
league further ; when giving the boy;the helm, and pre-
tending to stoop for something, I seized Muley surprise
and threw him overboard. As lie was an exceHig^ swlgi-'
a\er,l:C soon arose,and made towards the boat; Up6iirwjb^K
I took oat a fusee, and presented at him : " Muley/*
"I never yet designed to do you any harm, and seek ns-
« thing now but my redemption. I know you are able
"enough to swim to shore, and save your life; but if you
"arc resolved to follow me to the endangering of mine,
"the very moment you proceed, I will shoot you through
"the head." The harmless creature ffrthese words, turn-
ed himself from me, and I make no doubt got safe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at
the action; but I put him out of all fear, telling bim, that
if he would be true and faithful to me, I would do well by
him. "And therefore," said I, "you must stroke your
"face to be faithful; and, as the Turks have learned you,
"swear by Mahomet, and the beard of your father, or else
"I will throw you into the sea also." So innocent did the
child then look, and with such an obliging smile consent-
ed, that I readily believed him, and from that day forward
began to love him entirely.
We'then pursued our voyage ; and lest they should think
me gone to the Straits' mouth, I kept to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast; but, in the dusk of the evening,
I changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E.
that I might keep near the shore, and having a fresh gale
of wind, with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next
day-1 was one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Empe-
ror of Morocco's dominions. Yet still having the dreadful
apprehension of being retaken, I continued sailing for five
days successively, till such time as the wind shifting to the
southward, made me conclude, that if any vessel was in the
chase of me, they would proceed no further. After so
much fatigue and thought, I anchored at the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what or where ; neither did I see
any people. What I principally wanted was fresh* water;
and I was resolved about dusk to swim ashore. But n»
sooner did the gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed the
declining day, when we heard such barking, roaring and
howling of wild creatures, that one might have thought the
very strongest monsters of nature, or infernal spirits had
their residence there. Poor Xury, almost dead with fear,
entreated me not to go on shore that night. " Supposing I
v* don't, Xury," said I, " and in the morning we should see
es men who are worse than those we fear, what then ?" " O
u den we may give dem de shoot gun/1 replied Xury$_ ^
laughing, "and de gun make dem all run away." The 'wit* s
and broken English which the boy had learned among th& (
captives of our nation, pleased me entirely ; and, to add to
hrs cheerfulness, I gave him a dram of the bottle : we could
get but little sleep ail thenight for those terrible howlings
they made ; and, indeed, we were both very much affright-
ed, when, by the r^ings of the water, and other tokens,
we justly concluded one of these monsters made towards
our boat. I could not see till it came within two oars
length, when taken my fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I
hit him or no, I cannot tell; but he made towards the
shore, and the noise of my gun increased the stupendous
noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get
fresh water, and venture my life among the beasts or sav-
ages, should either attack'me. Xury said, he would take
one of the jars and bring me some. I asked him, why he
would go, and not I? The poor boy answered, u If wild
s( mans come, they eat me, you go away." A mind
scarcely now to be imitated, so contrary lo self-preserva-
tion, the most powerful law of Nature. This indeed in-
creased my affection to the child. "Well, dear Xury,"
said I, u we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and
"they shall eat neither of us/' So giving Xury a piece of
rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we waded ashore, carrying
nothing with us but our arms, and two jars for water. I
did not go out of sight of the boat, as dreading the savages
coming down the river in their canoes ; but the boy seeing
a low descent or vale about a mile in the country, he wan-
dered to it: and then running back to me with great pre-
cipitation, I thought he was pursued by some savage ov
wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving to perish
or protect'him from danger. As he came nearer to me,
I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which was a
creature he had shot like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer le^s ; however, we were glad of it, for it prov-
ed wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added to
our joy was, my boy assured me there was plenty of wa-
ter, and that he sec no ^viui wans. And greater still **
our comfort, when we found fresh water in the creek
we were when the tide was cut, without gohif
into the country.
In this place, I began to consider that the Ca
Cape dc vcrd islands lay not far off; but having u
merit, I knew not what latitude, or when to sta
sea far them; yet mv hopes were. I should m^et$?
B
 
the English trading vessels, who would relieve and lake
us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild country, in-
habited only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the negroes. It is filled with
wild beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly.—.
From this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain
Tencriff in the Canaries; which made me try twice to
attain it; but as often was I drove back, and so forced to
pursue my fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high; and the tide beginning to
Sow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in
a soft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest we
should be devoured. u For look yonder, mayter," said he,
"and see de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de
"hill." Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a
fearful monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that
lay cn shore, coveied as it were by a shade of a piece of
the hill, "Xury," said I, " You shall go on shore and kill
him" But the boy looked amazed: "Me kill him !" says
he, "he cat me at one mouth meaning one mouthful.
Upon which I bid him lie still, and charging my biggest
gun with two slugs, and a good charge of powder. I took
the best aim I could to shoot him thro' the head, but his
leg lying over his nose, the slug broke his knec-bone.
"The lion awaking with the pain, got up, but soon fell
down, giving the most hedious groan I ever heard: but
taking my second piece, I shot him through the head, and
then he lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury took heart
and desired my leave to go on shore. u Go then," said I.
Upon which taking a little gun in one hand, he swam to
shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a
period to ^is life, by shooting him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the hesh
t being good to cat Xury was like a champion, and
eson board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of bis^
\; but not having strength to perform it, he cut off
^ht me a foot. I bethought me, however, that
"onId be of use. This work cost Xury and me a
y ; when spreading it on the top of our cabin, the
.ms of the sun effectually drieu it in two days lime,
-utcrwards i.^rv-xl me for a bed to lie on.
 
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our
provisions, and went no oftener on shore than we were
obliged for fresh water. My design was to make the ri-
ver Gambia or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de
Verd, in hopes to meet some European ship. If Providence
did not so favor nie, my next cource was to seek for the
islands, or lose my life among the negroes. And in a
word, I put my whole stress upon this, "Either that I
"must meet with some ship or certainly perish."
One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black and stark naked- I was inclined to go on shore,
but Xury cried, " No, nohowever, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the shore by me a good way.
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held
a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by
signs and made them sensible I wanted something to eat;
they beckoned me to stop my boaU while two of them ran
up into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dried ilesh,
and some corn, which we kindly accepted; and to prevent
any fears on either side, they brought the food to the shore,
laid it down, then went and stood a great way off till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them, being all
we could afford, two mighty creatures came from the
mountains; one as it were pursuing the other with great
fury, which we were the rather inclined to believe, as they
seldom appear but in the night; and both these swiftly par-
sing by the negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swim-
ming about, as tho' the diversion of the waters had-put*
stop to their fierceness. At last one of them coming near-
er to my boat than I expected or desired, 1 shot him, cfi-
rectly through the head ; upon which he stink
ly, yet rising again, would have willingly mack?the sh&re-;
but between the wound and the strangling of thv wa*etS
he died before he could reach it. - - T

and the negroes seeming to covet the carcase, I freely
gyve it to them. As for the other leopard, it made to shore,,
and ran with prodigious swiftness out of sight. The negroes'
having kindly furnished me with water, and with what'rooter
and grains their country afforded, I took my leave, and,'
after eleven days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Ver<J,.
and those isands called by Us name. But the great dist-
ance I was from it, and fearing contrary winds would pre-,
vent my reaching them, I began to grow melancholy and
dejected, when, upon a sudden, Xury cryed out," Maslcr !.
"Master ! a ship with a sail!" and looked as affrighted as
if it was his master's ship sent in search of us. But I soon
discovered she was a Portuguese ship, as 1 thought bound
to the coast of Guinea for negroes. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But vain had it been, if
through their perspective glasses they had not perceive^
me and shortened their sail to let me come up. Encour-
aged at this, I set up my patron's.ancient, and fired a gun,
both as signals of distress,; upon which they very kindly-
lay to, so that In three hours time I came up with them.
They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and French,
but neither of these did I understand ; till at length a Scots
sailor called, and then I told him I was an Englishman^
who had escaped from the Moors at Sallee; upon which
they took me kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at
this happy deliverance! who from being a late miserable
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favor
with the master of the ship, to whom, in return for my
.deliverance, I offered all I had. trGod forbid," said he,
"that I should take any thirtg from you. Every thing
"shall be delivered to you when you come to Brazil, If
i( I have saved your life, it is no more than I should ex-
.il pect to receive myself from any other, when in the same
"circumstances I should happen to meet the like deliver-
"ance. And should I take from you what you have, and
"leave you at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away
"a life I had given. My charity teaches me bettetv
w Those effects you have will support you there, and pro-
"vide you a passage home again." And indeed, he acted
with the strictest justice,in what he did, taking my things
into his possession, and giving mean exact inventory,
even to my earthen jars. He bought my boat of me for
the ship's use? giving me a note, of eighty pieces of eigi4?
payable at Brazil; and if any body offered more, he would
make it up. He also gave me sixty pieces for my boy
Xury. It was with great reluctance I was prevailed upon
to sell- the child's liberty, who had served me so faithfully;
but the boy was willing himself; and it was agreed, that
after ten years he should be made free, upon his renounc-
ing Mahometanism, and embracing Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty-
two days after. And here 1 cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for %he leopard's skin,
and thirty for the lion's. Every tning he caused to be de-
liveied, and what I would sell he bought. In short I made
about 220 pieces of my cargo; and with tikis stock 1 en-
tered once more, as I may say into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with,
him till such time as I was informed of the manner of thetiv!
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well .they
lived, and how suddenly they grew'rich, I was filj^d with
a desire to settle among them and resolved to getlhy mo-
ney remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation* . ;;
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door lo an hon-
est and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, oi English parents,
whose plantation joining to mine, we improved it very
amicably together. Both our stocks were low, and for
two years we planted only for food: but the thirds^ear
we planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large
piece of ground the ensuing year for planting cane$. But
now I found how much 1 wanted assistance, and repented
the loss of my dear boy Xury. ?i
Having none to assist me, my father's words came^j^:"
my mind; and I used to ask myself, if what I sought*£8|tV.
only a middle station of life, why could it not ^jb well be
obtained in England as here? When 1 ponder^Ji^.this
with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook
me. 1 had none to converse with but i&y neighbour ; no
work to be clone but by my own hands; jt^often matle
me say, my condition was like to that of a man cast upon
a'desolate island. So unhappy are we in our reflections,
so forgetful of what good things we receive our^elve^; and
so unthankful for our deliverance from those o4^*t§es ^
that-.others endure.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I was in some measure settled, before the captain who ,
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went
to him, and told him what stock I had in London, desir-
ing his assistance in getting it remitted; to which the
good gentleman readily consented, but would only have me
send for half my money, lest it should miscarry; which,
if it did, I might still have the remainder to support me:
and so taking letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble
myself no farther about it.
And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me;
for he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon
my captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a car-
go proportionable to my condition. He alsb sent me over
tools of all sorts, iron work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, which proved tQ be of the greatest use to me
in my business. f|
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon sue-
cess crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rest-
ed happy in that middle state of life my father had so often
recommended; yet nothing would content me, such was
my evn genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a
foolish ambition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast my-
self into the greatest gulph of misery that ever poor crea-
ture fell into. Having lived four years in Brazil, I had
n6tonly learned the language, but contracted acquaint-
ance with the most eminent planters, and even the mer-
chaats of St. Salvadore; to whom, once5 by way of dis-
burse, having given an account of my two voyages to the
jcfcaSt of Guinea, and the manner of trading there for mere
trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with negroes,
they gave such attention to what I said that three of them
came one morning to me, and told me they had a secret
proposal to make. After enjoining mc to secrecy (it be-
ing an infringement on the powers of the kings of Portu-
gal and Spain) they told'me they had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with
negroes, which as they could not be publicly sold, they .
would divide among them; and if I would go their super-
cargo in the ship, to manage the trading part, I should
have an equal share of the negroes, without providing r.ny
stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I bean in
another condition! But I, born to be my own destroyer,
could not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer upon
condition of their looking after my plantation. So making
a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good friend
the captain, as my universal heir ; but obliged him to dis-
pose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set
sail the first of September, 1659, being the same day eight
years I left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sail-
ed northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till
we made Cape Augustine ; from whence going farther in-
to the ocean, out of sight of land, we steared as though
we were bound for the isle of Fernand de Norenba, leaving
the islands on the east; and then it was that we met with
a terrible tempest, which continued for twelve days suc-
cessively, so that the winds carried us wheresoever they
pleased. In this perplexity one of our men died, and one
man and a boy were washed overboard. When the weath>
er. cleared up a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees
north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the
captain gave reasons for returning ; which I opposed, coui>
selling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which,.a$ I sup-
posed, might be attained in fifteen days. So altering pur
course, we sailed north-west and by,west, in order to reach
the Lee-ward islands; but a second storm succeeding,drove
us to the west-ward; so that we were justly afraid of fail-
ing into the hands of cruel savages, or the paws of der
vouring beasts of prey. .
In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn-
ing cried out, " Landvland 1" which he had no sooner di-
ed out, but our ship struck upon a sand bank, and in a mo-
ment the sea broke ever her in such a manner that we ex*
pected we.should all have perished immediately. We knew
nothing where we wcre,or upon what land we were driven;
whether an island or the main, inhabited or notinhfabitetij
and we could not so much as hope that the ship wj^uld held
out many minutes, without breaking in pieces*^|p|ept the
wind by a miracle should turn about immed^telVi While
we stood looking at one another,espectingdeat8wery,nio»
ment. The mate lays hold of the boat, and with the, help of
the rest got her flung over the ship's side, and getting all
into heiybeing eleven of us, committed ourselves totGod's
mercy and the wild sea. And now we sawubtft this last ef-
fort would not be a sufficient protection fromx$euth£~5oh%h
did the sea rise, that it was impossible the bo&t should live*
As to .making sail, we hud none; neither if we had>.conl4
we make use of any. So that when we had rowed, or rather
were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-stern of us, and took us
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being
swallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call up-
on the tremendous name of God; much less to implore,
in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive our
departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when struggling
in the pangs of death ; but.while 1 wasoverwhelmed with
water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable.
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death.
I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal
gulph unknown, and as yet unperccived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more! Could I
even have thought of annihilation, or a total dissolution of
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of [laving no far-
ther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an e-
ternal quietus, without life or sense : even that, I say, would
have been enough to strike me with horror and confusion?
I strove, however, to the last extremity, while all my com
pinions were overpowered and entombed in the deep : and
it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till the wave
spent itself, and retiring backdeft me on the shore half dead
with the water I had taken in. As soon as 1 got on my feet,
1 ran as fast as I could, lest another w ave should pursue me,
#nd carry me back again. But for all the haste I made, I
coyld not avoid it: for the sea came after me like a high
mountain, or furious enemy; so that my business was to
liold my breath, and by raising myself on the water, pre-
serve k by swimming. The next r'rc.dful wave buried me
at once twenty or thirty feet deep, tut at the same time car-
ried me&*£h a mighty force and swiftness toward the shore;
when raising myself, 1 held out as well as possible, till at
length the Water having spent itself, began to return, at
which I struck forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I
took-to my heals again. Thus being served twice more, I
was at length dashed against a piece of rock, in such a
manner as left me senseless; but recovering a little before
the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would then have
overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those succeed-*
ing waves abated j and then fetching another raii> was
overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered.
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the
main land, where clambering up the cliffs of the shore,
tired and almost spent, I sat down on the grass, free from
the dangers of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstacies and transports that
my soul felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve
to.a dying- malefactor, with a halter about his neck, and rea-
dy to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, and
often lifted up my hands, with the profoundesf humility, to
the Divine Powers, for saving my fife, when the rest of my:
companions were all drowned. And now I began to ca9t
my eyes around, to be lipid what place I was in, and what I
Inid next to do. I could see no house nor people; I was
wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to eat or drink ; no weapon to destroy anjr
creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself against de-
vouring beasts ; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobac-
co-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The darksome
night coming on upon me, increased my fears of being de-
voured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged in des-
pair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life before
me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I had
lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I-could,
find any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy; and
taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got .up into,
a thick bushy .tree, and seating myself so that I could not
fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried
my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I awaked;
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was a*
bout a mile from the place where I was. When I came
down from my appartment in the tree, I perceived the
ship's boat two miles distant on my right hand, lying on
shore, as the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to.
her; but there being an inlet of water of about half a mile's
breadth between it and me, I returned again towarcjMfee
ship, as hoping to find something for my more imififefi^i
subsistence, about noon, when the sea was calm, t^tX
could come within a quarter of a mile of her, it w»4 *
grief I perceived, that, if we had kept on board all <pui4i^e;l*
bad be^en saved. These thoughts, and my soHttider&<e3&
tears from my eyes, though all in vain.So resolving to get to
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water,, when swim-
ming round her I was afraid I should not get any thing to
lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy a small
piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by
the help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into the
fore-castle of the ship* Here I found that the ship was bulg-
ed, and had a great deal'of water in her hold; her stern
was lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the
water. All her quarter and what was there, was free and
dry. The provisions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things; I also found some rum, of which I
took a hearty dram ; and now I wanted for nothing except
a boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was
needful for me.
Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se-
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and slung
as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying every
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away.
This'done., I went down to the ship's side, and tied four of
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and lay-
ing tw oor three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise,
I tcund it would bear me, but not any considerable weight.
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal
of labour and p.iins. I then considered what I should load
>t with, it being not able to be^r a pondrous burden. And
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it ail the plunks
and boards I rouid get; next I lowered down three of the
seamep's chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice,
three 'Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's Hesh, and
some i^uropean com, what little the rats had spared ; and
for iiqtlSrs, I found several cases of bottles belonging to
our skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four
or five gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By
this tiiiie the tide beginning to flow, 1 perceived my coat,
waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I had left on shore;
as for my linen-breeches and stockings, 1 swam with them
to the ship; but 1 soon found clothes enough, though I
jook no more than I wanted for the present. M jfceves
were chiefly on tools to work with; and, after a long spxvcX*
I found out the carpenter's chest, which I got suic d^^te
my raft. I then looked for arms and amirmniUor,>,ittl|p^'
the great cabin found two good fowling pieces, twc pistols,
several powder horns filled, a small bag of shot, and iwo old
rusty swords. I likewise found th ree barrels of powder, two
of which were good, but the third had taken water, also two
or three broken oars, two saws, an ax. and a hammer. I
then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three encour-
agements. 1. A smooth calm sea. 2. The tide,rising and
setting into shore. 3. The little wind there was blew to-
wards the land. After I had sailed about a mile, I found
the raft to drive a little distance from the place where I
first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of th®+
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: irf^~
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft "skx
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, fotrnear
half an hour, kept my baek straining ag.tinst the uhe^sis to
keep my effects in their places, ail I had would have gone
into the sen. But after some time, the rising of the water*
causea aie raft to float again, and coming up a little river'
wLh land on both sides, 1 landed in a little govs; as re©$r
the mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any
such providentially passed that way. . \:
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendo^iielgbt, stnS
rounded with lesser hills about it, and t&||ffr
solved to go and view the country, that I mlt
part was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly
myself with a pistol, a fowling piece, x>r-wder~anM
ascended the mountain. 1 here 1 perceived 1 was
island, encompassed by the sea ; no distant lands tft'be*
but 'scattering rocks that lay to the west t
to he a barren place, and, as I thought; inhabite&tii
wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but
of what kind, or whether good for nourishment;!^
one of them at my return, which occasioned a. c<k
screaming among the other birds, and I ioUlg|#t$
lours and beak, to be a kind of hawk3 but-its
feet carrion."
When 1 came to my raft, I brought
which work sj-ent th*a day entirely; iearin&S

; h t on shore. ri' ft
and ilie. next morning *^§fc-^clti
make a further attempt on tie slnf
luring away what necessaries I could find, before another:
storm should break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on
board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice
than the first, upon which I brought away the carpenter's
stores, two or three ba^> full of nails, a great jack-screw*
a dozen or two. of tiatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took
away several things that belonged to the gunner, particu-
larly two or three iron crows, two barrels of musket-bul-
lets, another fowling piece, a small quantity of powder*
and a large bagfull of small ajiot. Besides these, I took
all the men's clothes I could nnd, a spare top-sail, a ham-
friock, and some bedding; and thus completing my se-
cond cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing
some wild beast might destroy what I had there already.
Uut 1 only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the
chests, which seeming not to fear me or the gun that I
presented at her, I threw her a piece of biscuits which
she instantly ate, and departed.
When I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to
work in order to make me a little tent with the sail and
some poles which I had cut for that purpose ; and having
finished it, what things might be damaged by the weather
I brought in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a
circle, the better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of
man or beast. After this, 1 blocked up the doors with some
hoards, and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I
then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
ground, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as though
I had been in a Christian country.
Now> though I had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet dispairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammu-
nition and provision might be spent before such thing hap-
pened, I coveted as much as I could ; and so long as the
%hip remained in that condition, I daily brought away one
• -necessary or other; particularly the rigging sails, and cor-
dage, some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a
barrel of meal, three casks of rum, and, what indeed was
\nost welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-sail-yaref; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden I had tup-
on u, and net being able so dexterously to guide it, as the
forraen, both my cargo and I were-overturned. For in*
part, ali the damage I sustained was a wet skin; and at
low water, after much labour in diving, I got the most of
the cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven
times on board, bringing away all that was possible; and,
I believe, had the weatherbeen calm, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece. As I was going the
twelfth time, the wind began to rise ; however, I ventured
at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found
several razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives and
forks ; and in another thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight,
silver and gold. "Ah I simple vanity," said I, " whom
"this world so much dotes on, where is now thy virtue,
"thy excellency to me ? You cannot procure me one thing
"needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to £*
"place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteem-
"ed, is to me more preferable than all this heap. E'eit
"therefore remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as
"unregarded, even as a creature whose life is not worth
"preserving." Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it
up in a piece of canvas, and began to think of making an-
other raft; but I soon perceived the wind began to arise,
a fresh gale blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast
with clouds and darkness; so, thinking a raft to be in vaifc*
I let myself into the water with what things I had shout
me, and it was with much difficulty I got ashore, 'whefc
soon after it blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little tentf,sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur-
prised me for the present; yet, when I considered 1 had
lost no time, abated no pains, and had got^every tiling*use*
ful out her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and
entirely submitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend &§#&eimm
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any sucVwere in
the island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at
another I was for erecting a tent, and, at length, I resolved
to do both: the manner or form of which will not, Mope,
be unpleasing to describe. - ~, -
When I considered the qround where I was, thafritj£&s
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, ray resolutions
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered*, \v%^jij[
might not only be sheltered from the sun's scoyojhh^^^
 
but be more conveniently situated, as well as to be secured
from wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to dis-
covenany distant sail, should it ever so happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. I
found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
which being as steep as a house side, nothing could descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolv-
ed my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
lightful green before my door, with a pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-
side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was shel-
tered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I
drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diame-
ter, and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows
of strong stakes, not six inches from each other. Then
with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board, I re-
gularly laid them in a circle between the piles up to their
tops, which were more than five feet out of the earth, and
after drove another row of piles looking within side against
them, between two or three feet high, which made me
conclude it a little impregnable castle against men and
beasts. And for my better security I would have no door,
but entered ki and came out y the help of a ladder, which
I also made.
. Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried
all.my riches, ammunition, and stores. After which, work-
ing on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, I not
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-hoi se, and this cost me many days labour and
pains. One day in particular a shower of rain falling,
\ ihun^er and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
V fey powder should take lire, and not only hinder my neces-
v sary subsistence, by killing me food, but even blow up me
aixl my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to making
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
1501b. weight. And thus being established as king of the
jslaml,every clay I went out with my gun to see what I could
kill that v as fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers ofgfc^ts,
but very shy,yet having watched them narrowly,anftsee^Bfeg
Icoukl better shoot off the rocks than when in tjie taw1
grounds,! happened to shoot a she-goat suckling a youn^
kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her uncon-
cerned; and when I took the dead creature up, the young
one followed me even to the enclosure. I lifled the kid oyer
the pales, and would willingly have kept alive ; but finding
it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to slay it also
for my subsistence.
Thus entered into as strange a scene of life as ever any
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions con-
cerning my deplorable condition : and many times the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered
how I was debarred from all communication with human
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem
to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would
interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, sup-
posing you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally
perish ? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the
rest destroyed? Why should you complain, when not on-
ly your life is preserved, but the ship driven even into your
reach, in order to take what was necessary out of her for
your subsistence ? But to proceed. It was, by the account
I kept, the 30th of September, when I first landed on this
island. About twelve days after, fearing lest I should Josfc
my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath-days,
for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife tip-
on a large post, in great letters, and set it up, in the simili-
tude of a cross, on the sea-shore where I landed, Itameon
shore, September 30, 1659. Every day I cut a notch wkh
my knife on the skies of this square post, and that oil the
Sabbath was as long again as the rest, and every first day
of the month as long again as that long one. In this
manner I kept my calendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly
reckoning of time. But had I made a more strict search (as
afterwards I did) I needed not have set up this,mark j for
among the parcels belonging to the gunner, carffenjg^^d
captain's mate, I found those very things I wanted'i^^^^^;
larly pens, ink, and paper; also I found two or three ZQtfi-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials,p|^^^ve
glasses, books of navigation, three English Bible%i|p^
veral other good books, which I carefully put.i^y^Ki^|;
I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and r^^S^^
hoard, whom I made inhabitants with me in-'J^^^^;
Xhough one might think I had all the neqe^r^^it
were desireable, yet still I found sevemit^i^s^^i&ffe.
My ink was daily wasting; I wanted needles, 'pii^a^
 
thread to mend or keep my clothes together; and parti-
eularJy a spade, pickaxe, or shovel, to remove the earth.
It was a year before I finished my little bulwark; and
having some intervals of relaxation, after'my daily wan-
dering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan, alter-
nately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me of the mise-
ries and blessings of my life, under so many various cir-
cumstances.
Evil.

I must here add, to the description I have given of my
habitation, that having raised a turf wall against the outside
of it,I thatched it so close, as might keep it from the inclem-

my cave, and made a passage and door in the rock, win;!*
came out beyond the pale of my fortification, I next pro-
29
ceeded to make a chair and a table, and so began to study-
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practicable. When
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my
hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as possible, and
then smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs:
yet though I could make no more this way than one board
out of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to
shelter all my stores, every thing being regularly placed,
and my guns securely hanging against the side of the rock.
This made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the re-
sult of vast labour and diligence; which leaving for a
while, and me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the read-
er an account of my Journal from the day of my landing,
till the fixing and settling of my habitation, as heretofore-
shown.
JOURNx\L
SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659,1, unhappy Robinson Cm-
soe, having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this deso-
late Island, which I named the Desolate Island of despair,
my companions being swallowed up in the tempestous
ocean. The next day I spent in consideration of my
happy circumstances, having no prospect but of death,
either to be starved with hunger, or devoured with beajst&
or merciless savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort,I beheld the
ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had, that when therstoriVi
was abated, I might be able to get some food and necessa-
ries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be-
cause the ship did.stand upright. At this time |lamemed
the loss of my companions, and our misfortuno-ln ^ayiBg'
the vessel. When I perceived the ship as it were lifedry^?
I waded through the sands, then swam on board, the
weather being very rainy, and with scarcely any vdnch
To the 14th of this month, my time was empl^^^t^
making voyages, every tide getting what I coaldV^^^
the ship. The weather very wet an4 uaeer|tftinv v ~ ^j :'.
Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods therexjh: \^$$yiar
set j yet I recovered most again at low w axe& ^ ,
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night a|H^py|:.i^%
the- ship went in pieces, so that nothing ;w-aB^^&^^^
but the wreck at low water. This day I secured my
goods from the inclemency of the weather.
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could find a place
convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the even-
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf*
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up
my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night.
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber,
chests, and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling clucks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the morning I al-
lowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my gun;
I then worked till near eleven o'clock, and afterwards re-
freshed myself with what I had to eat. From twelve to
two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weath-
er. In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild
cat with a soft skin, but her fiesh was good for nothing.
The skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return,
I perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made ofT to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but omit-
ed'the 11th, which, according to my calculation I suppos*
fcd tobe Sunday.
'Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which however, m$fch
ccjled the air; with thunder and lightning, caused ivfme
n terrible surprise. The weather clearing, I secure^S^
powder in separate parcels. ** *>
Nov. 14—16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodg-
ing item in several places. I also shot a large fowl, whkh
^dv6d excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to
desist for want of a pick-ax, shovel, and wheel-barrow,
Iron crows I caused to supply the place of the first; but
with ail my art I could not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling
what Brazilians call an iron tree. I had like to have spoil-
ed my ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly
heavy; yet with much labour and industry, I made $
sort of a spade out of it. -
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily carried on my
business; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave,
that it might not only serve me for a warehouse, but
kitchen, parlour, and cellar, I commonly lay in the tent,
unless the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry. So
wet would it be at certain seasons, that I was obliged to
fcover all within the pale with long poles, in the form of
rafters, leaning against the rock, and loaded them with
flags and large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished,
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it
was a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasion-
eel a great deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could
make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove nails and .
staples in the wall and posts to hang things out of the way. c
Dec. 20, Every thing I got into its place, then made a
sort of a dresser, and another table.
Dec. 24—25. Ram in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one,
and wounded another.* I led it home in a string, bound up
its leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became
so tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and feJloW
me where I pleased. This put me in mind to brin^ip
tame creatures, in order to supply me with foodaft^^l;^
ammunition was spent. ~ .^aStfe***
Dec. 28-29-30. The weather being excessivel;^^pt,r
with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep witfe
in doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry, however, obliged by necessity, I went
out with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the
valleys; they were exceedingly shy, nor could my dog
hunt them down.
Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was toimish
the wail before described, and search the island. I discov-
ered a kind of pigeons like our house-pigeons in a nest a-
mong the rocks. I brought theft home, nursed them till
they could fly, and then they left me. After this^ I shot
Some, which proved excellent food. ^©$ne time I spent
vainly in contriving to make a cask ; X masiy Weil s&ylf w££
vain5 because I could neither joint the $t&v$8*;«*)&;fix vihe
bearls, so as to make it tight: So, teaying^fi^!t;oofc^n|e
goat's tallow I had about me, and a little ^^umf e ^
 
 
wick, and provided myself with a lamp, which served me1
instead of candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For being in
the height of my search, what should come into my hand,
but a bag, which was used to-hold com (as I supposed) for
the fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in
it, I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock,
little expecting what the consequence would be. The rain
had fallen plentifully a few days before ; and about a month
after, to my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I came to view
it more nicely, every day as it grew, I found about ten or
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same
shape and make as that in England.
I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this
sight* Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and
fortune. But now, the appearance of this barley, flourish-
ing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving
how it should come there, made me conclude, that miracles
were not yet ceased: nay, I even thought that God had ap-
pointed it to grow there without any seed, purely for my
sustenance in this miserable and desolate island. And in-
deed such great effect this had upon me, that it often made
me.melt into tears, through a grateful sense of God's mer-
cies; and the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of barley some rice stalks,,
also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in the island; and therefore made a diligent
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to
find any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I had
shaken the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my ad-
miration ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being,
as thinking it was but natural, and not to be conceived a
miracle; though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful event of
God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of this
corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully together with
20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap the
fruit of my labour; yet lour years were expires before t
could allow myself to eat dr. bari^y iue\n\ar/. much lon-
ger time before I had any rice. AUu ai^wth h^ieLoiga-
ble pains and industry, for three or four months, at last I
finished my wall on the 14th of April, having no way to
go into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where I had space
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack'me,
without scaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the
blessing of God does not crown our labours? Or who can
^tand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth his
arm ? For one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only
the roof of the cave came rumbling about my ears, but the
posts seemed to crack terribly at the same time. This
put me in great amazement; *r.<! running to the ladder,
and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an
earthquake, the place I stocn' on sustaining three terrible
shocks in less than three minutes. Bui judge of my ter-
ror when I saw the top of a great rock roll into the sea;
I then expected the island would be swallowed up every
moment: and what made the scene still more dreadful,
was to see the sea thrown into the most violent agitations
and disorders by this tremendous accident.
For my part I stood like a criminal tit the place of exe-
cution ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I
was as.it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid lest the
rock, under which was my fence and habitation, should
overwhelm it and myself in a lasting tomb.
When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spi-
rits began to revive; yet still I would not venture to as-
cend the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing v\hat
I should do. So little grace had I then, as only to say
Lord have mercy upon me ! and no sooner was the earth-
quake over, but that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose,
at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind, *The
sea seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled s^ttft^
petuously, that nothing could be perceived but frotfi^nd
foam. Three hours did this storm continue, andin-<s|o?i*
olent a manner, as to tear the very trees up by the roots,
which was succeeded by abundance of rain. When the
tempest was over I went to my tent : but the Thin eb^ikig,
onin n, furious manner, I was obliged to take shelje^jlf
 
the cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through 1117
fortification to let the water out. It continued raining all
that night, and some time the next day. These accidents
made me resolve, as soon as the weather cleared up, to
build me a little hut in some open place, walled round to
defend me from wild creatures and savages; not doubt-
ing but at the next earthquake, the mountain would fall
upon my habitation and $ne, and swallow up all in its bow-
els.
April 16—20. These days I spent in contriving how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.-
When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found
in its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I
should move or not; but at length resolved to stay where
I was, till I found out a convenient place where I might
pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolutions in prac-
tice, I was stopped for want of tools and instruments to
Work with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless,
occasioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my grind-stone
of use to me, and at last I found out a- way to turn it about
with my foot, by help of awheel and a string.
April 2$, 29. These days were spent in grinding my
tools.
April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but
ohe biscuit a day.
May L As I walked along the sea shore, I found a bar-
rel of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea
bad flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship,
whose stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This I suppose was-
occasioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my
old place of abode; awc^also to go to the ship that day,
but then found it impossible. #
..May 3, This day I went on board, and with my saw
Sawed off one of the beams, which kept her quarter-deck.,
I then clearpd the sand till flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they were not whole-
sotne. The same day I also catcheda young dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck, and*sa*r-
cd another piece of timber, and when the flood came, I
made a tioat of three great planks, which were -drivel
.ashore by the tide.
35
- May 6,7, 8, 9. These days I brought off the iron bolts,
opened the deck wit h the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, having made way into the very middle of the
wreck.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. All this time I spent in bring-
ing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
off some lead From the roll, but all in vain, for it lay too
iow un#er water.
May 16. 1 omitted going to the wreck this day, for em-
ploying myself in looking for pigeons, I out-staid my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship.
May* 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the
crow, that at the first flowing tide several casks floated out,
and many of the seamen's chests,yet that day nothing came
to land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had
some Brazil pork in it. I continued working up to the 15th
of June ^ (except necessary times for food and rest) and
had I known how to have built a boat, I had timber and
planks enough : I had also near JOG weight of sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the sea side, F
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen
on the island, though, as I afterwards found, there were
many on the other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found m her
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and pleas-
ant I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continu-
al rain ; and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than,
usual.
June 19. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a tremb-
ling and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked with pain
and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the-di&mai
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre*
quently, but very confusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in mjf ^iacU
June 23. Again relapsed much as before. /W \
June 24. Merited a second time. ^; ^f-S- «
June 25. A violent ague for sevets hours, caMan*^&
#is7succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak, yet I scrambled out.,
shot a she goat, brought it home and broiled some of it;
I would willingly have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague ; thirs-
ty, yet could not help myself to water: Prayed to God
in these words: "Lord,in pity look upon me: Lord have
"mercy upon me: have mercy upon me I" After .this I
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me^hen I
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this
strange and terrible sort of dream.
JVIe thought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at
the outside of the wall where Psat whe^p the storm blew
after the earthquake ; and that I saw » man descending
from a great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He
Was all over as bright as a flash of fire that a little before
surrounded him ; his countenance inccmceiveably terrible;
the earth as it were trembled when he stept upon the
ground, and flashes of fire seemed to fill all the air. No
sooner I thought him landed upon the earth, but with a
long spear, or other weapon, he made towards me; but
first ascending a rising ground, his voice added to my
amazement, when I thought I heard him pronounce these
dreadful words, " Unhappy wretch! seeing all these
u things have not brought thee to repentance, thou shalt
"immediately die." In pronouncing this dreadful sen-
tence, I thought he went to kill mc with a spear that was
in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to express the
horrors of my mind at this vision : and even when I awak-
ed, this very dream made a deep impression upon my
mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I received from
my father's instructions, and that, was worn out by an un-
interrupted series of sea faring impiety for eight years
space. Except what sickness forced from me, I do not
remember I had one thought of lifting up my heart to-
wards God, but rather had a certain stupidity of soul, not
having the least sense or fear of the Omnipotent Being
when in distress, nor of gratitude to him for his deliver-
ances. Nay, when I was on the desperate expedition on
the desert African shore, I cannot remember I had one
thought of what would become of me|or to beg his con-
solation and assistance in my sufferings and distress. Wte^
the Portugal captain took me up? and honorably used m4
nay, further, when I was even delivered from drowning by
escaping to this island, I never looked upon it as a judg-
ment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog, and that's
ail. Indeed, some secret transports of soul I had, which
was not through grace, but only a common flight of joy,
,that I was yet alive, when my companions were all drown-
*ed, and no other joy coutd I conceive but what is common
with the sailors over a howl of punch, after they had es-
caped the greatest dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni-
ences, might have called upon me for a thankful acknow-
ledgement to Providence. Indeed, the growth of my corn
touched me with some sense ; but that soon wore off again.
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin-
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no lonr-
ger than its duration. But now, when my spirits beg^n.
to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and" I
could leisurely view the miseries of death present theiffe-
selves before my eyes, then my awakened conscience be-
gan to reproach roe with my past life, in which I had so
wickedly provoked the justice of God to pour down his
vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as these oppressed me even in the vio-
lence of distemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only
proceeded from the fear of death. But when I considered
my father's advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weep-
ing; for he told me, a That if I did persist in my folly, I
"should not only be deprived of God's blessing, but have
<£ time enough to reflect upon my despising his instruo
"tions, and this, in a wretched time, when none could
st help me." And now concluding it to be fulfilled, having
no soul in the island to administer any comfort to me, I
prayed earnestly to the Lord, that he would help me in
this my great calamity. And this, I think, was the first
time I prayed in sincerity for many years. But now I
must return to my journal.
June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a
.great consternation; and fearing that the ague might return
/the succeeding day, I concluded it time to get something
to c#mfurt TOe.y|l|led a case bottle with Water> an&setit
""Tun reach olfm|>ed; and, to make it more nourishing
 .less chilly, I pit some rum in it. The next thing! did
co broil me a piece of goal's flesh, of which I ate Wt
D
 
 
little. 1 was very weak; however, walked about, dreading
the return of my distemper; and at night I supped on
three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, beg-
ging God's blessing therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of
doors with my gun; but was so weak, that I sat down, and
looked at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I
continued here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, of
which I have seen so much ? From whence came myself,
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made?
Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty
invisible Power, who framed the earth, and sea, and air,
and all therein. But what is that power?
Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet,
said I, if God has made all this he must be the ruler of them
all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the Power
that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide and
direct them. And if this be so (as certainly it must) nothing
can happen without his knowledge and appointment. Then
surely, if nothing happens without God's appointment, cer-
tainly God has appointed these my sufferings to beful me.
And here I fixed my firm belief that it was his will that
if should be so ; and then proceeded to inquire, w hy should
.God deal with me in this manner? or what have I done
thus to deserve his indignation?
. Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a
blasphemer; crying with a loud and piercing voice, uUn-
"worthy wretch I how dare you ask what you have done?
"Look on your past life, and see what you have left un-
"done? Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the
u merciless hands of death? Why not drowned in Yar-
"mouth roads, or killed in the fight, when the ship was
"taken by the Sallee man of war? Why not entombed in
"the bowels of wild beasts on the African coast, or
"drowned here when all thy companions suffered ship-
"wreck in the ocean r"
Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pensive
manner, being so thoughtful that I could not go, to sleep;
and fearing the dreadful return of my djstempeiy|Lcaus-
ed me to remember, that the Brar/iliaj^fiise tobacco fo^l-
most all diseases. 1 then went to my #est in order to^*
some) where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to findao#v
for both soul and body ; for there ,1 found one of the Bib!
<
 
which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor inclination
to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of the
chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece of leaf,
and chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost
stupified me. Next I steeped it in some rum an hour or
two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it: and
in the third place, 1 burnt some over a pan of fire, holding
my nose over it as long as I could endure it without
suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to me
these words, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
H deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'*
At first this sentence made a very deep impression on
my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered
the word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children
of Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can
"God spread a table in the wilderness ?" In like manner I
began to say, w Can God himself deliver me from this de-
u solate island ?" However, the words would still return to
my mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had doze4 my
head, I was inclined to sleep; but before I would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that Go4
had made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called
"upon him in the day of trouble he would deliver me.?
With much difficulty I afterwards drank the rura,wb£re*
in I had steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head)
threw me into such a profound sleep, that it was three
o'clock the next day before I awaked; or rather, I believe,
I slept two days, having certainly lost a day in my account,
and I could never tell any other way. When I got np%
my spirits were lively and cheerful; my stomach much
better, being very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, which was the 29th, but found myself much
altered for the better.
The 50th, I went abroad with my gun, but not
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand gopse> which,
however, I cared not to eat when I brought them hfcf&i*
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the ev#n»
ihg l i^newed tny medicine, excepting that I did not lite
so large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the
1st of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again
took my medicine as I did the first time.
^ July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this con-
dition, I often thought of these words, "I will deliver
"thee and while, at some times, I would think of the
impossibility of it, other thoughts would reprehend me for
disregarding the deliverances I had received, even from
the most forlorn and distressed condition. I asked my-
self, what regard have I had to God for his abundant mer-
cies? Have I done my part ?" Me has delivered me, but
"I have not glorified him —as if I had said, I had not
owned and been thankful for these as deliverances, and
how could I expect greater? So much did this sensibly
touch my heart, that I gave God thanks for my recovery
from sickness in the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on
what is written in the New Testament, resolving to read
a chapter every morning and night as long as my thoughts
would engage me. As soon as I set about this work seri-
ously, I found my heart deeply affected with the impiety
of my past life; these words that I thought were spoken
to me in my dream revived, "All these things have not
"brought thee to repentance.'* After this, I begged of
God to assist me with his Holy Spirit in returning to my
duty. One day in perusing the Scriptures, 1 came to these
words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give re-
upentance and to give remission Immediately I laid
down the book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly
Cried, "O blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou
H exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance 1" And
now indeed I prayed with a true sense of my condition,
and a more certain hope, founded on the word of God.
Now I had a different sense of these words, <w Call on me'
a and I will deliver thee," that is from the dreadful load of
guilt which oppressed my sinful soul, and not from a soli-
tary life, which might rather be called a blessing, seeing I
wanted neither food nor raiment, when compared with
Jiving among the human race, surrounded with so much
oppression, misery, and affliction: in a word, I came to
this conclusion, that a deliverance from sin was a much
greater blessing, than a deliverance from affliction. Bui
again I proceed to my journal*
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little
and a little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments
I used were perfectly new: neither could I recommend
them to any one's practice. For though it carried off the fit,
it very much weakened me, and I had frequently convul-
sions in my nerves and limbs for some time. From this
I learned, that going abroad in, rainy weather, especially
when it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind,
was most pernicious to health. I had now been about tea,
months in the island; and as I never had seen any of the
human kind, I therefore accounted myself sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my
mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in or-
der to make new discoveries.
The 5th of July, I began my journey; I first went to
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore ; and
travelling further, found the tide went no hitrher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of
which I did not understand. I searched a long time, for
the Cassava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes; though at that time I knew not what they -
were ; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect
for want of cultivation* With these few discoveries, -I
came back that night, and slept contentedly in my little
JHpmext day, being the 16th, going the same way, but
Mprer than the day before, I found the country more
adorned with woods and trees. Here I perceived different
fruits in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this dis-
covery, yet ate very sparingly, lest I should throw.myfcelf
into a tlux or fever. The grapes I f©und of excellen%^^
for when I had dried them in the sun, which pr«?f#^^
them as chied raisins are kept, they proved ve'ry-i^^fe./;-
some and nourishing, and served me in those s©|g£8&
i¥hen no grapes were to be had.
 
 
D2
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had
lain out my habitation. And when the morning came, I
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about
four miles, as I imagined, by the length of the valley, di-
recting my course northward, there being a ridge of hills
on the south and north side of me. At the end of this val-
ley, I came to an opening, wjiere the country seemed to de-
scend to the west; there I found a little spring of fresh
"water, proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crys-
tal streams running directly east. And indeed, here my
senses were charmed with the most beautiful landscape na-
ture could afford ; for the country appeared flourishing,
green, and delightful, that to me it seemed like a planted
garden. I then descended on the side of that delicious
vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and
citron trees, but very wild and barren at that time.
As for the limes, they were delightful and wholesomer
the juice of which I after used to mix in water, which made
it very cooling and refreshing. And now I was resolved
to carry home and lay up a store of grapes, limes, and lem-
ons, against the approaching wet season. So laying them
up in separate parcels, and then taking a few of each with
me, I returned to my little castle, after having spent three
days in this journey. Before I got home, the grapes were
so bruised that they were utterly spoiled; the limes in-
deed were good, but of those I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten, which made
me conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To pre-
vent this happening again, I gathered a large Qu^^te °£
the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches Ijfike
tree? both to keep them unhurt, and that they might'^^e
and dry in the sun ; and having well loaded myself with
limes and lemons, I returned once more to my old place of
residence.
And now contemplating on the fruitfulness of this val-
ley, and pleasantness of its situation, its security from .
storms, and the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I con-
cluded I was settled in the worst part of the country, and.
therefore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I considered again, that though it was plea*
santj it was off from the sea-side, where there was £ p<?s*-
 
sibility, sometime or other, a ship might either be driven
or sail by; and that to inclose myself among hills and
woods must certainly put an end to my hopes of deliver-
ance; I resolved to let my castle remain where Provi-
dence had first assigned it. Yet so ravished was I with
this place, that I made me a little kind of bower, surround-
ing it with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, welJ
staked and filled with bullrushes: and having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the first of August
before I began to enjoy my labour.'
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them
from the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of
the sun: the most of which I carried to my cave; and
happy for me 1 did so; by which 1 saved the best part of
my winter food.
Aug. 14. This clay it began to rain ; and though I had
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter of a
hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to re-
treat to, I was obliged to return to my old castle. The
rain continued more or less every day, till the middle of
October ; and some times so violently, that I could not stir
out of my cave for several clays. This season I found my
family to encrease; for one of my cats that ran away from
me, and which I thought had been dead, returned about
August, with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which
I thought strange, because both my cats were females,
and the wild cats of the island seemed to be of a different
kind from our European cats; but from these cats pro-
ceeded such nennbers, that I was forced to kill and destroy,
them as I would do wild beasts and vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir out, it rain-
ing incessantly; when beginning to want food, I was com-
pelled to venture twice, the first of which I shot a goat,
and afterwards found a very large tortoise. The manner
of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of rai-
sins served me for my breakfast, a piece of goat's flesh
or turtle boiled for my dinner, and two or three turtle's
eggs for my supper. While the rain lasted, I worked dai-
ly two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by de-
grees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the
outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,, which
came beyond my fence or wall, and so I came in ^ii put
this way. But after I had done this, I was troubled |&ge0
myself thus exposed ; though 1 could not peri€^^^p;
thing to fear, a goat being the biggest creature I had seen
upon this island.
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which
amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the anniversary
of my landing ; and therefore humbly prostrating myself
on the ground, confessing my sins, acknowledging God's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus
Christ to have mercy upon me, I fisted for twelve hours
till the going down of the sun ; and then eating a biscuit
and a bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great
comfort took my night's repose. Till this time I never
had distinguished the Sabbath-day ; but now I made a
longer notch than ordinary for the dnys of rest, and divid-
ed the weeks as well as I could, though I found I had lost
a day or two in my account. My ink failing soon after,
I omitted in my daily memorandum things of an indiffer-
ent nature, and contented myself to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life. The rainy and dry
seasons appeared now regular to me, and experience
taught me how to provide for them ; yet in one thing I
am going to relate, my expedience very much failed mc.
You may call to mind what I have mentioned of some bar-
ley and rice which I had saved; about tnirty stalks of the
former and twenty of the Utter ;%nd at that time, the sun
being in its southern position, £oing from me, together
with the rains, made me conclude it a very proper season
to sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground with my
wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, sowed about
two thirds of my see J, preserving by me about a handful
of each. And happy it was I did so; for no rains falling,
it was choaked up, and never appeared above the earth till
the wet season came again, and then part of it grew as if
it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking
for a moister piece of ground near my bower. I there sow-
ed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the ver-
nal equinox; which having the rainy months of March
and April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up
very pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not
during to venture all ; and by the time I found out the
proper seasons to sow it in, and that I might expect every
year two seed times and two harvests, my stock amounted
to abov e half a peck of each sopt of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I
had cut from the trees, shot out like willows the first year
after lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut
them from: but they grew so regularly beautiful, that
they made a most lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut more of them;
and these soon growing made a glorious fence, as after-
wards shall be observed.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner:

Dry, sun running south of the Line*
The wet seasons would continue longer or shorter, as
the winds happened to blow. But having found the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care foe*
forehand to furnish myself with provisions; and during
the wet months sat within doors as much as possible* ^|
this time I contrived to make many things that I wanted
though it cost me much labour and pains, before I could
accomplish them. The first I tried was to mate a bas»
ket; but all the twigs I could get proved so brittle^ that I
could not then perform it.
It now proved of great advantage to me that when a
boy, I took a great delight in standing at a basket-maker's
in the same town where my father lived, to view them at
work; and, like other boys, curious to see the manner of
their working these things, and very officious ^ assist*. I
perfectly learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but
the tools. And it coming into my mind, that the twigs of
that tree of which I made my stakes, might be as tough
as a sallow willow, or osiers, growing in England, 1 re-
solved to make an experiment, and went the next day to
lny country-seat, and found some fit for my turn; and af-
ter cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, 1 dried them
in my pale, and, when fit to work with, carried them to
my cave, where I employed myself in making several
sorts of baskets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever
I pleased. It is true, they were not cleverly made* yet
they served my turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask
to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almost full of rum,
a few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bot-
tles, neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large
Icettle unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I want-
ed likewise afcthe beginning of this dry season a tobacca
pipe, but for this I afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook, I had a mind to see the whole island, I now resum-
ed my intention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of l^pins, with a larger quan-
tity of powder and shot than usual, I began my journey.
Having passed the vale where my bower stood, I came
within view of the sea lying to the west; when it being a
clear day, I fairly descried land, extending from the West
to the S, W. about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded;
but could not say whether it was an island or a continent.
Neither could I tell what this place might be; only
thought it was part of America, and where I might Ivvve
been in a miserable condition, had 1 landed. Again I con-
sidered that if this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one
time or other, I should see some ship pass by: and if it
was not* then it must be the sava coast, between the
Spanish country and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals
or man-eaters.
As i proceeded forward I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine, the fields fragrant, adorn-
ed with sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with
several very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty}
which made me long for one to be my companion ; ,bu^
it was with great difficulty I could knock one down with.
my stick ; and I kept him at home some years before I
could get him to call me by my name.
In the low grounds, I found various sorts of hares and
foxes, as I took them to be, but much different from those
in England. Several of these I killed, but never ate them;
neither indeed had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leaden hall
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey I did
not travel above two miles a-day, because I took several
turns and windings, to see what discoveries I could maket
returning weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or in a place
which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature
might suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea
shore, I was amazed to see the splendour of it. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful fish, and conM
stantly abounding with innumerable turtle#and fowls oS
many kinds, which I was ignorant of, except those called
penguins. I might have shot as many as I pleased, but
was sparing of my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a
she-goat, which I did with much difficulty, on account of
the flatness of the country.
Now though tikis jourd^ produced me the most pleas-
ing satisfaction,yet my habitation was so much to my liking
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island. I Continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the East, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour-
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east
from my castle, and so round till I came to my post again.
As I had a constant view of the country, I thought I could
not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three miles,
when I descended into a very large valley, so "surrounded
with hills covered with wood, that having no guide but
the sun, nor even this, nless I knew well the position of
it at that time of the day; and to add to my misfor-
tune, die weather proving very hazy, I was obliged to re-
turn to my post by the sea side, and so backwards the
same way I came. In this journey my dog sj^rffted a
kid, and would have killed it, had I not pre^pited hifii*
As I had often been thinking of getting a kid o^iffe, art3
so raising a breed of tame goats to supply me Ettlgr
ammunition was spent, I took this opportunity of begin>
lung: and having made a collar for this little creature?
 
with a string made of rope yam, I brought it to my bow-
er, and there inclosed and left him ; and, having spent a
month in this journey, at length I returned to my own
habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned
to my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock.
After my journey I rested myself a week, which time
I employed in making a cage for my pretty poll.
I now began to consider the poor kid I had left in the
bower, and immediately went to fetch it home. When I
came there I found the young creature almost starved; I
gave it some food, and tied it as before, but there was no oc-
casion, for it followed me like a dog; and, as I constantly
fed it, it became so loving, gentle and fond, that it com-
menced one of my domestics, and would never leave me.
, The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept^ne 30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual, it being the third year of my abode in
the island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable, and less sinful, th^n that of human society;
and for the communications of his grace to my soul, in sup-
porting, comforting, and encoujaging me to depend upon
his Providence, and hope for nR eternal presence in the
world to come.
Indeed I often did consider how much*more happy I was
in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of living I
formely used; and some times when hunting, or viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul would break out upon
me, and my very heart would sink within me, to think of
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in ; and how
I was a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and,
bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without"
hopes, and without redemption. In this condition I would,
often wring my hands, and weep like a child: and evet\
some times, in the middle of my work, this fit would take
me; and then I would sit down and sigh, looking on tfee
ground for an hour or two together, till such time as my
grief got vent in a flood of tears.
One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner,
I opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes up-
on these words," I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee?*
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me, or else
why sliould they appear just at the moment when I am be*
moaning my forlorn condition ? and if God does not for-
sake, what matters it, since he can make me more happy
in this state of life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splendor
in the world? Bat while I was going to return God thanks
for my present state, something seemed to shock my mind,
as if it had thus said: Unworthy wretch, can you pretend
to be thankful for a condition, from which you would pray
to be delivered! here I stopt :—and tho' I coujd not say,
I thanked the Divine Majesty for being there, yet I gave
God thanks for placing to my view my former course of
life, and granting me a true knowledge of repentance.
And whenever I opened or shut the Bible, I blessed kind
Providence, that directed my good friend in England to
send it among my goods without any order, and for assist-
ing mc to save it from the power of the raging ocean..
And now beginning my third year, my several daily em-
ployments were these: First, My duty to Heaven, a||d di-
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures, whiclf I did twi^or
thrice every day : Secondly, seeking provision with my gun,
which commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning: Thirdly, the ordering, curing^pre-
serving and cooking what I had lulled, or catchectfor my
supply, which took me up great part of the day: foriaHhc
middle of the day, the sflh being in its height, it was.so
hot, that I could not stir out; so that I had-only but foixv
hours in the evening to work in, and then the want of tools*
of assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a
board fit for a long shelf, which two sawers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut oft" the same tree in half
a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be broad.
I was three days in cutting it down, and two more in lop-
ping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of timber.
This I hacked and hewed off each side, till it became light*
to move; then turned it, made one side of it smooth &ixl
fiat as a board from end to end, then turned it downward*
cutting the other side, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any body
may judge my great labour and fatigue in such a piece
of work; but this I went through w ith patiinfce, as; also
many othgr things that my circumstances made necessa-
ry..for rn&lo do.
The harvest months, November and December* j#ere
now at hapdj in which I had the pleasing prospect of a
E J'
good crop. But here I met with a new misfortune; for
the goats and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the
blade, kept it so short that it had not strength to shoot up
into a stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge,
and by day shot some of its devourers; and my dog which
I had tied to the field gate, keeping barking all night, so
frightened those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.
* But nq sooner did I get rid of these, than other enemies
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds, who
only waited till my back was turned to ruin me. So much
did this i rovoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors; and afterwards served them as they do noto-
rious thieves in England, hung them up in chains as a ter-
ror to others. And indeed, so good an effect had this that
they not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the isl-
and, so long as these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber, which was my second harvest,! reaped it with a scythe,
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut-
ting down my first crop it was so slender. The ears I car-
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead
of thrashing it: ajicl when the harvest was over, found
my half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice,
and two bushels and a half of bSrley.
w -And now I plainly foresaw, that, by God's goodness I
should be furnished with bread; but yet wras concerned,
because I knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn,
nor bread, neither knew how to bake it. I would not, how-
ever taste any of the crop, but resolved to preserve it
against next season, and in the mean while, use my best
endeavours to provide myself with other food.
But where were my labours to end? the want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to digit, I conquer-
ed by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow
i supplied myself, with dragging over the corn a great
bough of a tree. When it was growing, I was forced to
fence it; when ripe to mow it, carry it name, thrash i<-,
part it from the chaff, and save it. And after all, I wanted
a mill to grind it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make
it into bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my brains
to work to find some expedient for every one of these ne-
cessaries against the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
me more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of
51
eround near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sow-
ed my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took
me up three months; by which time the wet season com-
ing on, and the rain keeping me within doors, I found se-
veral occasions to-employ myself: and while at work,
used to divert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him
to know and speak his own name Po//, the first welcome
word I ever heard spoke in the island. I had been a long*
time contriving how to make earthen vessels, which I
wanted extremely: and when I considered the heat ofthe
climate, I did not doubt but if I should find any such clay
I might botch up a pot, strong enough,- when dried in the
sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry,
as corn, meal, and other things.
To be short, the clay I found; but it would occasion the
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward ways I
took, and what ugly misshapen things I made ; how many
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun,
and fell in pieces when they were removed; so that-I think
it was two months time before I could perfect any thing:
and even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earth-
en jars. These, however, I very gently placed in wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them, and between the pot
and the baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley straw, and
these I presumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps
the meal when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller
things, I made them with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers and pipkins, the sun bak-
ing them very hard.
Yet still J wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and
that was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but
also to bear the fire, which none of these could do. It once
happened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein
a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as a rock,
and red as a tile. This made me think of burning some
pots ; and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them
with lead, I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in:
the inside red hot, and found that they were not cracked
at all: and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let one
of them stand in the fire about five or six hours, tillth&
 
fire by degrees, till the redness abated; and watching
them till the morning, I found I had three very good pip-
kins, and two earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my
turn as I could desire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery.
For after this, I may say, I wanted for no sort of earthen
ware. I filled one of my pipkins with water to boil mc
some meat, which it did admirably well, and with a piece
of kid I made me some good broth, as well as my circum-
stances would afford me at that time.
The next concern I had was to get me a stone-mortar
to beat some corn in, instcathof a mill to grind it. Here
indeed I was at a great lossv.as not being fit for a stone
cutter; and many days I spent to Find out a great stone
big enough to bear the weight of a pestle, and that would
break the corn without filling it with sand. But all the
stones of the island being of a mouldering nature, render-
ed my search fruitless; and then I resolved to look out
for a great block of hard wood, which having found, 1
formed it with my ax and hammer, and then, with infin-
itive labour, made a hollow in it, just as the Indians of
Brazil make their canoes. When I had finished this, I
made a great pestle of iron wood, and then laid them up
against my succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make me a sieve, to sift my
meal, and part it from the bran and husk. Having no
fine thin canvas to search the meal through, I could not
tell what to do. What linen I had was reduced to rags:
1 had goats* hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor
did I know how to spin it: At length I remembered I
Ii&d some neckcloths of calico or muslin of the sailors,
which I had brought out of the ship, and with these I
made three small sieves proper enough for the work.
I come now to consider the baking part. The want of
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very
broad but not deep. When \ had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which I had made
myself: and when the wood was burnt into live coals, I
spread them over it, till it became very hot; then sweep-
ing them away, I set down my loaves, and whelming down
the earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes, and coals all
around the outsides of the pots to continue the heat: and
in this manner I baked my barley loaves, as well as if I
had been a complete pastry-cook, and also made of the-
rice several cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder that these things took me up the best
part of the year, since what intermediate time I had was
bestowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry;
for in the proper season I reaped my corn, carried it home,
and laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till I had
time to rub instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my
corn increased so much, that it produced me twenty bush*
els of barley, and, as much rice, that I not only began to
use it freely, but was thinking now to enlarge my bams,
and resolved to sow as much at a time as would be sufcv
cient for me for a whole year. ^
All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it.—
For, allowing that I had attained that place, I run the haz-
ard of being killed and eaten by the llev^jiui^g cannibals;
and if they were not so j yet I might be slain, as other Eu-
ropeans had been, who fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran continually upon that
shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat
with the shoulder of mutton sail: I went to the ship's boat
that had been cast a great way on the shore in the lata
storm. She was removed but a little ; but her bottom be-
ing turned up by the impetuosity, and fury of the waves
and vvind, I fell to work with all the strength I had, with
levers and rollers I had cut from the wood, to turn her,
and repair the damages she had sustained^- This work
took me up three or four weeks, when finding my little
strength all in. vain, I fell to undermining if by digging
away the sand, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall. But after this
was done, 1 was still unable to stir it up, or to get under
it, much less to move it forward towards the water, and
so I wast forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I
began to think whether it was not possible for me to make
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk
of a tree. But here 1 lay under particular inconveniences;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it m
the water when it was made. However, to work J wfcnt
upon it, stopping all the inquiries 1 could make, with this
simple answer I made to myself, Let's first makeiv
FJ1 warrant I'll find some vvaf or other to get it along
when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and
four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two
feet, after which it lessened for a space, and then parted
into branches. Twenty days was I a hacking and hewing
this tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the
branches and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like
the bottom of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks
"with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in such a manner, as
that it was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much
bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and conse-
quently sufficient to transport me and all my effects to that
wished-for shore I so ardently desired.
Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest diffi-
culty to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with
wonderful pains and labour I dug into the bowels of the
earth, and made a declivity. But when this was done, all
the strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it
was when I attempted to remove the boat. I then pro-
ceeded to measure the distance of, ground, resolving to
make a canal, in order to bring the water to the canoe,
since I could not bring the canoe to the water. But as this
seemed impracticable to myself alone, under the space
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into some sort of
consideration : so that I concluded this also to be impossi-
ble, and the attempt altogether vain. 1 now saw, and not
before, what stupidity it is to begin work before we reckon
its cost, or judge rightly our own abilities to go through
with its performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At tins time I did not
forget my anniversary ; but kept it with rather greater de-
votion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated,
I looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do
with ; and very well might I say, as Father Abraham said
unto Dives," Between thee and me there isagulph fixed."
And indeed I was separated from its wickedness too, hav-
ing neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, mv
the pride of life ; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king,
and emperor over the whole country I had in possession
without dispute and without controul: I had loadings of
corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes
above measure. What was all the rest to me ? the money
I had laid by me as despicable dross, which 1 would freely
have given for a groce of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to
grind my corn: in a word, the nature and experience of
these things dictated to me this just reflection: That the
good things of this world are no farther good to us, tfaSn
they are for our use; and that whatever we may hear/up«
to give to others, we can but enjoy as much as we use,
and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usu-
al. Every time I sat down to meat, 1 did it with thankful-
ness, admiring the Providential hand of God, who, in this
wilderness had spread a table to me. And now I consider-
ed what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted, compared
my present condition with what I first expected it should
be ; how should I have done, if I had got nothingout of the
ship; that I must have perished before I bad caSgbt £sh
or turtles ; or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage,
by eating them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my
claws, like a beast. 1 next compared my station to that
which I deserved: how undutiful I had been to my pa-
rents ; how destitute of the fear of God ; how void of every
thing that was good; and how ungrateful for those abund-
ant mercies I had received from Heaven, being fed as it
were, by a miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by
ravens; and. cast on a place where there is no venomous
creatures to poison or devour me ; in short, making God's
tender mercies matter of great consolation, I relinquished
all sadness, and gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as posMble, 1 used to minute down the days &t
the month, on which any remmkable event happenexK—
. And,"
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go
to sea, the same day afterwards in the next year, I was
taken and made a slave by Sahee rovers:
That the very day I escaped out ot ihe wreck of the ship
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the same day, I made
my escape from the Sailec in my pation's fishing boat:
And, on the 30th of September, being the day of the
year I \y#s born on, on that day twenty-six years after,
was I miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this hlmid,
56
LIFE AND ABVENTURE-S
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the biscuit
which I had brought out of the ship, and though I allowed
myself but one-cake a-day, for above a twelve month, yet
I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got any
corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen had been gone long before. However, I had preserv-
ed about three dozen of the sailors chequered shirts which
jp-poyed a great refreshment to me, when the violent beams
^^the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seaman's
hihvy watch-coats ; which made me turn tailor, and, after
a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets.
To preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat skins,
with the hair outwards to keep out the rain ; which indeed
served me so well, that afterwards I made me a waist-
coat and open kneed breeches of the same: and then I
contrived a sort of an umbrella, covering it with skins,
which not only kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also.
Thus being easy, and settled in my mind, my chief hap-
piness was to converse with God, in most heavenly and
comfortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure
my raisins, and plant my barley and rice, both of which I
had a years provision before hand* But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it at intermediate,
times, my business to make a second, of much inferior
size; and it was two years before 1 had finished it. But
as I perceived it would no wise answer my design of sail-
ing to the other shore, my thoughts were confined to take
a tour round the island, to see what further discoveries I
could make. To this intent, after having moved her to
the water, and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail of the ship's sail that lay
by me. I then made lockers or boxes at the end of it, to
put in necessaries, provision and ammunition, which
would preserve them dry, either from rain or the spray of
the sea; and in the inside of the boat, I cut me a long hol-
low pUce to lay my gun in, and to keep it dry made a flag,
to hang over it. My umbrella 1 fixed in a step in the
stern, tike a mast, to keep the heat of the sun off mjB^
And now resolving to see the circumference of mjHUUg,
kingdom, I victualled my ship tor the voyage, pufti^g^^
two dozen of my barley bread loaves? an earthen pot fuJP^C
 
jarclied rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder
and shot, and two watch coats.
It was the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign,
or captivity, that I set out in this voyage, which was much
longer than I expected, being obliged to put farther out,
by reason of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea.
And indeed so much did these rocks surprise me, that £
was for putting back, fearing that if I ventured farther it
would be out of my power to return. In this uncertainty^
I came to an anchor just off shore, to which I waded wigp
my gun on my shoulder, and then climbling up a hull
which over-looked that point, I saw the full extent of it9
and so resolved to run all hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a violent cur-
rent running to the east, coming very close to the point;
which I the more carefully observed, thinking it danger-
ous, and that when I came tait, I might be drove into the
sea by its force, and not able to return to the island; and
certainly it must have been so, had I not made this obser-
vation ; for on the other side was the like current, with this
difference, that it setoff at a greater distance; and I per-
ceived there was a strong eddy under the land; so that
my chief business was to work out of the first current,
and conveniently get into the eddy* Two days I stakl
here, the wind blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being
contrary to the current, leaves a great breach of the sea
upon the point; so it was neither fit for me to keep too
near the shore, on account of the breach ; nor stand at t<m
great a distance, for fear of the streams. That night th©
wind abating, it grew so calm, that I ventured out; and
here I may be a monument to all rash and ignorant pilots V
for I was no sooner come to the point, and not above the
boat's length from shore, but was got into a dflfep water,
with a current like a mill, which drove my boat along so
violently, that it was impossible for me to keep near the
edge of it, but forced me more and more out from the
eddy to the left of me ; and all I could do with my paddles
were useless, there being no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, sinee as
the current run on both sides of the island, I was very cer-
tain they must join again, and then I had no hopes but of
perching for want in the sea, after what provision I had
was%ent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of my mind at
this calamity ? with longing eyes did I look upon my little
kingdom, and thought the island the pleasantest place in
the universe. Happy, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I
never see thee more? wretched creature I whither am I
going? why did I murmur at my lonesome condition,
when now I would give the whole world to be thither
again^? while I was thus complaining, I found myself to
be .driven about two leagues into the sea; however, I la-
^9tn?ed till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as
iaJMnorth as possibly I could, to that side of the current
where the eddy lay on.
About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind spring up
from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart; and was still
|more elated, when, in about half an hour, it blew a gently
fine gala. Had any thick weather sprung up, I had been lost
another way; for having no compass on board, I should
never have found the way to steer towards the island, if
once it hadvdisappeared ;.but it proving the contrary, I set
up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away north-
ward, as much as I could, to get rid of the current. And no
sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceived,
by the clearness of the water, a change of the current was
near, for where it was strong, the water was foul; and
where it was clear, the current abated. To the east, I soon
saw, about, half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks,
which caused it again to separate; and as the main force
of it drove away more soutbwardly,leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other came back by the repulse of the
rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned back again-
to the north-west with a very swift stream-
They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved up-
on the lad||er,or to be saved from thieves, just going to take
#way theitMives, or such as have been in the like calamities,
with my own, may guess my present excess of joy ; how
heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy, and how
joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind, standing
cheerfully before it, with a smart tide*under foot. By the
assistance of this eddy, 1 was carried above a league home
again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt the
two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within g
league of the island, and perceived the points, of the rock*
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed hm
iorc,to the southward, which throwing off the current more
southwardly had occasioned another eddy to the north.
But having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this eddy,
and in an hour came within a mile of the shore, where I
soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an^hum-
ble prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a
resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought
my boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to talp&a
welcome repose. When I awoke, I was considering
I might get my boat home; and coasting along tfi« si
I came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or bnwik^
where finding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if She
.had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her. ::,
I now perceived myself not far from the place wheffe
before I had travelled on foot; so taking nothing with me,
except my gun and umbrella, I began my journey, and in
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down
to rest. 1 had not slept long before I was awakened in
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin! Where
u are you, Robinson Crusoe? Where are you? Where
"have you been
So fast was I asleep at first, that i did not awake tho-
roughly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I
dreamed that somebody spoke to roc. But, as the voice re-
peated Rbinso?i Cnisoe several times, being terribly af-
frighted, I started up in the utmost confusion; and no
sooner were my eyes fully open, but 1 beheld my pretty
Poll sitting on the top of the hed^e, and soon knew that
it was him that caled me; for just such bewailing lan-
guage I used to talk and teach him ; which he so exactly-
learned, that he would sit upon my finger, and Jay his bill
close to my face, and cry," Poor Robinson Cru^e, where
4t are you? where have you been? how came you here i**
and such like prattle I had constantly taught him. //: *
But even though I knew it to be the Parrot, it was%%reat
while before I could adjust myself; being amazed h&#.the
creature got thither, and that he should fix about tiiat telace,
and no where eJse. But now being assured it cj^& be no
other than my honest Poll, my wonder ceased, anil reaching
out my hand, and calling familiarly Poll, the creature eagle

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
bird was overjoyed to see me; and so I took him home
along with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea;
yet I could wish my boat, which had cost me so much
trouble and pains, on this side the island once more, but
which indeed was impracticable.
I therefore began to lead a very retired life, living near a
twelvemonth in a very contented manner, wanting for no-
'% *" g except conversation. As to mechanic labours, which
necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could, upon oc-
on, make a tolerable carpenter were the poor tools I
^had to work withal but good. Besides,, as I improved in
my earthen ware, I contrived to make them with a wheel,
which I found much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But I think, I
was never so elevated with my own performance or pro-
ject, than for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which
though it proved an awkward clumsy thing, yet it was
very sound, and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my
great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, making me abund-
ance of necessary baskets, which though not very hand-
some, were very handy and convenient to fetch things
home in, as also for holding my stores, barley, rice and
other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made mc examine after
what manner I should kill the goats or birds to live on af-
ter it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways
to ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive,
particularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire,
for making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I
found one morning, in one of them, an old he smu and
in the other three kids, one male, the other two _ nates.
So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him
away. But I forgot the old proverb, "that hunger will
c< tame a lion:" For had I kept him three or four days
without provisions, and then giving him some water, with
a little corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid.
The other creatures I bound with strings together; but I
had great difficulty before I could bring them to my habi-
tation. It was some time before they would feed, but throw-
ing them sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they
began to be tamer. From hence I concluded, that if 1 de*
signed to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammu*
 
mtion was spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock
of sheep, about my settlement, was the only method I
could take. I concluded also I must separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would ahvuys run wild as they
grew up; and the best way for this, was to have some in-
closed piece of ground, well fenced, either with a hedge
or pale, to keep them so effectually, that those within
might not break out, or those without break in. Such an
undertaking was very great for one pair of hands; but aft;
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first cmB
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and
cover to keep them from the sun.
Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land so
large, that had I inclosed it, the hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles about. Indeed had it been ten
miles, I had time enough to do it in ; but then I did not
consider that my goats would be as wild in so much com-
pass, as if they had had the whole island, and consequent-
ly as difficult for me to catch them. This thought came
into my head, after I had carried it on, I believe, about fif-
ty yards; I therefore altered my scheme, and resolved to
inclose a piece of ground about one hundred and fifty-
yards in length, and one hundred in breadth, sufficient
enough for as many as would maintain me, till such time
as my flock increased, and then I could add more ground.
I now vigorously prosecuted my work", and it took me
about three months in hedging the first piece ; in which
time I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, feed-
ing them as near me as possible, to make them familial*:
and indeed I very often would carry some cars of barley
or a hateful of rice, and feed them cut of my hand ; by
which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was fin-
ished, and I hud let them loose, they would run after me
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end;
and in a year and a half's time 1 had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years after, they
amounted to forty-three, besides what I had taken and kil-
led for my sustenance. After which I inclosed five seve-
ral pieces of ground to feed them in, v%ith pens to drive
tIio*$into, that I might take them as I had occasion,
Ii&this project I likewise found additional blessings; for
I ns&anly had plenty of goat's fic^Iu but milk too. Mhidi
1 - * F
in my beginning I did not so much as think of. And,
indeed, though I had never milked a cow, much less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some es-
says and miscarriages, I made me both, and never after-
wards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities?
Kow can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons ; "what
a bounteous tabic was here spread in a wilderness for me,
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger.
Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner.
There sat my royal majesty, and absolute prince and ru-
ler of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, v horn
if I pleased, I could cither hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had
done. Pod) as if he had been my principal court favorite,
•was the only person permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who
had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat
on my right hand ; while my two cats sat on each side of
the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal
ttvark of my royal favor. These were not the cats 1 had
brought from the ship; they had been dead long before,
and interred near my habitation by mine own hand. But
one of them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a
couple of their young I had made tame; the rest run wild
into the woods, and in time grew so impudent as to return
and plunder me of my stores, till such time as I shot a
gleat many, and the rest left me without troubling me
arty more. In this plentiful manner did I live, wanting
for nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concern*
mc, the want of my boat; I knew not which way to
get her round the island. One time I resolved to go
along the shore by land to her ; but had any one in En-
gland met such a figure, .it would either have affrighted
them, or made them burst into laughter; nay, 1 could not
but smile myself at my habit, which I think in this *>lace
will be very proper to describe.
The cap I woie on my head, was great, high, and sl;a|c-
Icss, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or pent-house k&J|g-
ing down behind, not only to keep the stin ft cm mt* ®|;
to'shoot the rain off from running into my neck, r,oili%g
being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh
in these climates. I had a short jacket of goat's skin,
whose hair hung clown such a length on each side, that it
reached down to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and
stockings, I had none, but made a semblance of something,
I know not what to call them; they were made like bus-
kins, and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, barbarous-
ly shaped like the rest of my habit. I had a broad belt
of goat's skin dried, girt round me with a couple of thongs*
instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply the de-
ficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and saw'.
I had another belt, not so broad, yet fastened in the same
manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the end of
it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, made of goat's
skin, to hold my powder and shot. My basket I carried
on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, which,
however, next to my gun, was the most necessary thing
about me. As for my face, the colour was not so swar-
thy as the Mulattoes, or might have been expected from
one who took so little care of it, in a climate within nine
or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time my beard
grew so long that it hung down about a quarter of a yard;
but as I had both razors and scissors in store, I cut it all
olf, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair of Ma-
hometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore by
some Turks at Sallee, not long enough indeed to hang a
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence nere, there being
none to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, without
fear and without controul, I proceeded on my journey, the
prosecution of which took me up five or six days. I first
travelled along the sea-shore, directly to the place where
I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks;
but now having no boat to take care of, I went overland a
nearer way to the same height that I was before upon;
ivhen looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being
no ripling motion, nor current, any more than in other
pfep.es. This made me ponder some time to guess the
treason of it, when at last I was convinced that the ebb se t-
ting from the west5 and joining with the current of w^i#£
irom some great river on shore, must be the occasion of
these rapid streams ; ami that, consequently, as the winds
blew more westwardly, or more southwardly, so the cur-
vent came the nearer, or went the farther from the shore.
To satisfy my curiosity, I waited there till evening, when
the time of ebb being made, I plainly perceived from the
rock the current again as before, with this difference, that
it ran farther off, near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my expedition, it set close upon ft, furiously
hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done. And now I was convinced,
that, by observing the ebbing and flowing of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the inland again. But
when I began to think of putting it in practice, t::e re-
membrance ofthc late danger struck me with honor, that
i changed my resolution and formed another, which was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was to make
another canoe, and so have one for one side of the island,
and one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the first my
little fortification, fort or castle, with many large and spa-
cious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the
cave behind me with several little caves, one with another,
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with
which I made my "wall were grown so lofty and great as
obscured my habitation. And near this commodious and
pleasant settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved
torn-fields, which kindly yielded me their fruit in the pro-
per season. My second plantation was that near my
country-seat, or-iittle bower, where my grapes flourished,
and where, having planted many stakes, 1 made inclo-
sures. for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much stronger than a wall, and conse-
quently impossible for them to break through. As for my
bower itself; I kept it constantly in repair, and cut the
trees in such a manner, as made them grow thick and wild
and form a delightful shade. In the centre of this stood
my tent, thus cre^ed. I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece ofthc ship's sail; be-
neath which I made a sort of a couch with the skins of
the creatures I had slain, and other things; and having
laid thereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had sav-
ed from the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with
a-great watch-coat, I took up this place for nsy county
retreat.
Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And some1
times I would venture in her a cast or two from shore, but
no farther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from
the island as before. But now I entreat your attention,
whilst I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surpris-
ing scene of life which here befel me.
You may easily suppose that after having been here so
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a hu-
man creature.
One day it happened, that going to my boat, I saw the
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evident on
the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of it. Had I seen
an apparition in the most frightful shape, I could not have
been more confounded. My willing ears gave the strictest
attention. I cast my eyes around, but could satisfy neither
the one nor the other. I proceeded alternately to every
part of the shore, but with equal effect; neither could I see
any other mark, though the sand about it was as suscepti-
ble to take impression, as that \\ hich was so plainly stamp-
ed. Thus struck with confusion and horror, I returned to
my habitation, frightened at e very bush and tree, taking
every thing for men ; and possessed with the wildest ideas I
that night my eyes never closed. I formed nothing but the
most dismal imaginations, concluding it must be the mark
of the devil's foot which I had seen. For otherwise how
could any mortal come to this island? where was the ship
that transported them? and what signs of any other foot-
steps? though these seemed very strong reasons for such
a supposition, yet (thought I) why should the devil make
the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can see, when he
might have taken other ways to have terrified me? why
should he leave his mark on the other side of the island,
and that too on the sand, where the surging waves of the
ocean might soon have eraced the impression.
Surely this action is not consistent with the subtility of
Satan, said I to myself; but rather must be some danger-
ous creature, some wild savage of the main land over
against me, that, venturing too far in the ocean, has been
driven here, either by the violent currents or contrary
"winds; and not caring to stay on this desolate island, has
gone back to sea again.
F 2
Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the sava-
ges had seen me in that place: yet I was not altogether
without fear, lest, having found my hoat, they should re-
turn in numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all
my corji and destroy my flock of tame goats. In a word,
all my religious hopes vanished, as though I thought God
would not now protect me by his power, who had so won-
derfully preserved me so long.
What various chains of Providence are there in the life
of man? How changeable are our affections, according to
different circumstances? we love to-day, what we hate
to-morrow, we shun one hour, what vs c seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous man-
ner; for I who before had so much lamented my condition,
in being banished from all human kind, was now even
ready to expire, when I considered that a man had set his
foot on tins desolate island. But when I considered my
station of life decreed by the infinitely wise and good pro-
vidence of God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's
sovereignty, who has an unbounded ri>>lit to govern and
dispose of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and that
his justice and mercy could eitiier punish or deliver me:
I say, when I considered all this, I comfortably found it
my duty to trust sincerely in him, pray ardently to him,
and humbly resign myself to his divine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, these words of the sa-
cred writings came to my mind, " Call upon me in the day
k< of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt $»Iori-
"fy me." Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully
from my bed, I offered up my prayers in the most hea-
venly manner; and when I had done, taking up my Bible
to read, these words appealed hrst in my sight:—" Wait
"<M the Lord, and be of good cheer, and he shall streni»th-
{i en thy heart: Wait, I say, on the Lord.*' Such divine
comfort did this give me, as to remove all cause of sadness-
upon that occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked my goats one of which was almost spoiled for wanfr
of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and
milked my flocks there also; when, growing bolder I went
down to the shore again, and measuring- the print of the*
foot to mine, to sec, perhaps, whether I myself had not
occasioned that mark, I found it much superior in large-
ness, and so returned home, now absolutely convinced that
either some men had been ashore, or that the island must
be inhabited, and therefore that I might be surprised be-
fore I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my security, and
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur-
pose. I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and
turn my tame cattle wild into the woods that the enemy
might not fbd them, and frequent the island in hopes of
killing the same.- Secondly, I was for digging up my
com fields, for the very same reason. And lastly, I con-
cluded to demolish my bower, lest, seeing a phtce of hu-
man contrivance, they might come farther and findoutand
attack me in my little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me; and*
I looked 1 thought like the unfortunate king Saul, when
not only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by
God himself. And it is strange, that a littie before, having-
entirely resigned myself to the will of God* I shomd now
have little confidence in him, fearing those more who
could kill this fading body, than him who could destroy
my immortal soul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature, spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the
next morning, and then joining reason with fear> I consi-
dered that this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entii ely forsaken as I might think; but that the inhabi-
tants from the other shore might bail, either with design or
from necessity, by cross winds; and if the latter circum-*
stance, I had reason to believe they ^ould depart the first
opportunity. However my fear made $ne think of a place
for retreat upon an attack. I now repented that i had i%ade
2uy door to come out beyond my fortification; to remedy
which, I resolved to make me a second one: I fell to work,
therefore,and drove betwixt that double row of trees* which
I planted above twelve years befoie, several strong piles,
thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
strengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of
my cave; I also made me seven holes, wherein I planted
my muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resem-
bling carriages. This being finished with indefatigablein-
^stry\ for a great way every where, I planted sticks of
c^sier Use a wood, about twenty thousand ot them, leaving* %
ia%e space between them and my wall, that 1 might have
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
room to see an enemy, and that they might not be shelter-
ed among the young trees, if they offered to approach the
outer wall. And indeed, scarce two years had passed over
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and
in six years it became a thick wood, perfectly impassable.
For my safety, I left no avenue to go in or out; instead of
which I set two ladders, one to a part of a rock which wa3
low, and then broke in, leaving room to place another lad-
der upon that; so that when I took these down, it was im-
possible for any man to descend without hurting himself;
and if they had, they would still be at the outside of my
outer wall. But while I took all these measures of hu-
man prudence for my own preservation I was not altogeth-
er unmindful of other affairs. To preserve my stock of
tame goats, that the enemy should not take all at once, I
looked out for the most retired part of the island, which
was the place where I had lost myself before-mentioned,
and there finding o clear piece of land, containing three
acres, surrounded with thick woods, I wrought so hard,
that in less than a month's time, I fenced it so well round,
that my flocks were very well secured in it, and put there-
ill two he-goats and ten she ones.
<\A11 this labour was occasioned purely by fearful appre-
hensions, on account of seeing the print of a man's foot j
and not contented yet wiih what I h id done, I searched for
another place towards the west point of the island, where I
might also retain another flock. Then wandeiing on this
errand more to the west of the island than ever 1 had yet
done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, me thought I
perceived a boat at a great distance; but could not possibly
tell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I con-
sidered then,it was no strange thing to see the print of a-
man's foot; and concluding them cannibals,blessed God for
being casto>i the other side of the island, where none of
the savaged, as I thought, ever came. But when I came
down the hill to the shore, which was the S, W. point of
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor can
any one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw
the ground spread with sculls, hands, feet and bones of
human bodies; and, particularly, I perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a (ire, -.tbout whiclt
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrifi*-
ced and devoured their fellow creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle*
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from
my stomach in an excessive manner* I then returned to-
wards my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave
God thanks for making my nature contrary to these
wretches, and delivering me 50 long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here had assur-
ed me, that these savages, never came up to the thick woody
part of the country^hd that I had no reason to be appre*
hensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that for two years after, I confined myself only to
my three plantations; I mean my castle, country-seat,
and inclosure in the woods. And though in process of
time my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet
my eyes were more vigilant for fear of being surprised*
and I was very cautious of firing my gun, lest being heard
by those creature^, they sfioulcl proceed to attack me. I
resolved, however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and
went armed with three pistols stuck in my girdle, which
added to the description I have given of myself before,
made me look with a very formidable appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed; and when I compared my condir
tion to others, I found it fa* from being miserable. And,
indeed, would all persons compare their circumstances,
not with those above them, but with tlpse innumerable
unhappy objects beneath them, I am stijp- we should ttot
hear those daily murmurings and compFainings that are
in the world. For my part, I wanted but few things. In-
deed the terror" which the savages had put me in, spoiled
some inventions for my own conveniences. One of my
projects was to brew ma some beer; a veiy wi.imsical
one indeed, when it is considered that I had neither c isks
sufficient, nor could I make any to preserve it in; neither
had I hops to make it keep, yeast to mt.ke it work, nor a
copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after
some years I might bring this to bear, as i had done oili-
er things. But now my inventions weie placed another
way ; and day and night I could think ot nothing but how
I might destroy some of these cannibals, when proceeding
to their bloody entertainments; and so saving a, victim
from being sacrificed, that he might after become my ser-
vant* M&ny were my contrivances after thter purpose*
and as many more objections occurred, after I hatched
them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and put therein five .or six
pounds of gunpowder, which would consequently blowup
all those that were near it; but then I was loth to spend
so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain ex-
ecution I could desire, and but only afnight, and not kill
ihem. Having laid this design aside, I again proposed to
myself to lie privately in ambush, in some convenient
place, with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at
them in the midst of their dreadful ceremony ; and hav-
ing killed two or three of them at every shot, fall upon
the rest suddenly with my three pistols, and not let one
mother's son escape. This imagination pleased my fancy
so much, that I used to dream of it in the night time. To
put my design in execution, I was not long in seeking for
a place convenient for my purpose, where unseen I might
behold every action of the savages. Here I placed my two
muskets, each of which was loaded with a pair of slugs,
and four or five smaller bullets about the size of pistol bul-
lets; the fowling piece was charged with near a handful
of the largest swan-shot, and in every pistol were about
four bullets. And thus all things being prepared, no soon-
er would the welcome lip ht spread over the element, but,
like a giant refreshed with wine, as the Scripture has it,
would I issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty hill
three miles distant, view if I could see any invaders ap-
proach unlawfully to my kingdom. But having waited in
vain two or three months, it not only became very tire-
some to me, but also brought me to some consideration,
and made me examine myself, what right I had to kill
these creatures in this manner.
If, argued I to myself, this unnatural custom of theirs
be a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine
Being, who alone has the vindictive power in his hands,
to shower down his vengeance upon them. And perhaps
he does so, in making them become one another's execu-
tioners. Or, if not, if God thinks these doings just, ac-
cording to the knowledge they conceive, what authority
have 1 to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence,
"which has permitted these actions for so many ages, per-
haps from almost the beginning of the creation? The/
never offended me, what right have I then to concern ray *
self in their shedding one another's blood? And indeed 1
have since known, they value no more to kill and devour
a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox or eat mut-
ton. I then concluded it necessarily followed, that these
people were no more murderers than Christians who ma-
ny times put whole troops to the sworcl, after throwing
down their arms.—Again, I considered that if I fell upon
them, I should he as much in the wrong as the Spaniards
who had committed the greatest barbarities upon these
people who had never offended them in their whole lives;
as if the kingdom of Spain was eminent for a race of men
without common compassion to the miserable, a princi-
pal sign of the most generous temper: these considera-
tions made me pause, and made me think I had taken
wrong measures in my resolution : I now argued with
myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to remain
undiscovered as long as I possibly could; that an opposite
conduct would certainly prove destructive; for it was not
to be supposed I could kill them all, and might either be
overpowered by the remaining, or, some escaping, might
bring thousands to my certain destruction. And, indeed,
religion took their part so muc.h as to convince me how
contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding hu-
man blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they
arc to one another; that I had nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said be-
fore, (o do therein what seemed convenient to his heaven-
ly wisdom. And, therefore, on my knees i thanked A1-.
mighty God for delivering me from blood-guiltiness, and
begged his protection that I might never fall into their
hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly began,
I never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: I
only removed my boat, which lay on the other side of the
island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards.the
cast, into a little cove, that there might not be the least
shadow of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.—
My castle then became my cell, keepingalvvays retired on-
ly when I went out to milk my she-goats, and order my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out of danger;
for sure I was that these savages never came here with
expectations to find any thing, and consequently never
wandered from the coast; however, as they might have
sevei\d times been on shore, as wfrH before as .after my
dreadful apprehensions, I locked back with horror to think
in what state I might have been, had I suddenly met them
slenderly armed, with one gun only loaded with small
shot; and how great would have been my amazement, if,
instead of seeing the print of one man's foot, 1 had per-
ceived fifteen or twenty savages, who having once set
their eyes upon me, by the swiftness of their feet would
have left me no possibility of escaping? These thoughts
would sink my very soul, so that I would fall into a deep
melancholy, till such time as the consideration of my gra-
titude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart. I then
fell into a contemplation of the sacred springs of Provi-
dence, and how wonderfully we are delivered, when sensi-
ble of it; and when intricated in uncertain mazes or laby-
rinths of doubt or hesitation, what secret hint directs us
in the right way, when we intend to gfc out of it; nay, per-
haps contrary to our business, sense, or inclination. Upon
which, I fixed within me this as a certain rule, never to
disobey those secret impressions of the mind, to the act-
ing or not acting any thing that offered, for which I yet
could assign no reason. But let it be how it will, the ad-
vantage of this conduct very eminently appeared in the
latter part of my abode on this island; I am a stranger in
determining whence these secret intimations of Provi-
dence derive; yet methinks they are not only some proof
of the converse of spirits, but also of the secret communi-
cations they are supposed to have with those that have not
passed through the gloomy vale of death.
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preserva-
tion, put a period to ali future inventions and contrivances,
either for accommodation or convenience. I now cared
not to drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire,
lest either the noise should be heard, or the smoke disco-
ver me. And on this account I used to burn my earthen
wan privately in a cave which I found in "the wood, and
whiclj I made convenient for that purpose; the principal
cause that brought me here was to make charcoal, so that
I might bake and dress my bread and meat without any
danger* At that time a curious accident happened me,
which I shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for making my
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch
of underwood. Curious to look into it, I attained its
mouth, and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright
in. But when I had entered, and took a further view?
73
two rolling shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dart
themselves at me ; so that I made all the haste o#t that I
could, as not knowing whether it was the devil or a roaster
that had taken his residence in that place. When I recov-
ered a little from my surprise, I called myself a thousand
fools, for being afraid to see the devil one moment, who Had
now lived almost twenty years in the most retired solitude.
And therefore resuming all the courage I had, I took a
flaming firebrand, and rushed in again. I had not proceeded
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than be-
fore ; for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human
creature in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken
noise, resembling words half expressed, and then a broken
sigh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought I to myself)
where and in what enchanted place have I plunged myself,
such as are reported to contain miserable captives, till death
puts an end to their sorrows? And indeed, in such great
amazement was I, that it struck me with a cold sweat,
and had my hat been on, it is propabie my hair would have
moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the
hope of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the
light of my firebrand, perceived it to be a monstrous he-
goat, lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of
mere old age. At first I stirred him, thinking to drive him
out, but the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his
feet but vvas not able; so I e'en let him lie still to affright
the savages, should they venture into this cave. I now look-
ed round me and found the place but small and shapeless.
At the farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance,
yet so low, as must oblige me to creep upon my hands
and knees to it; so having no candle, I suspended my
enterprise till the next day, and then I came provided
with two large ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my bunds and feet, through ^this
strait, I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet.
But surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before!
the roof and walls of this cave reflected a hundred thou-
sand lights to me from my two candles, as though they
were indented with shining gold, precious stones, or spark*
ling diamonds. And indeed it was the most delightful ca-
vity or grotto of its kind that could be desired, though en-
tirely dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a kbcl
of gravel upon it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be
seen there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could find.
no fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that
evea |Jxg might be very necessary for my defence, and
there&K£ resolved to make it my most principal magazine.
I brought hither two fowling pieces, and three muskets,
leaving only five pieces at my castle, planted in the nature
of cannon. Of the barrel of gunpowder, which I took up
out of the sea, I brought away about sixty pounds of good
powder, which was not damaged, and removed this, with
a great quantity of lead for bullet, from my castle to this
retreat, now fortified both by art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac-
cessible to any but themselves, or, at least, most danger-
ous to attempt. And now I despised both the cunning
and strength of the savages, either to find me out or to
hurt me.
But I must not forget the old goat, which caused my
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up
the ghost the day after my discovery; and it being diffi-
cult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and honourably en-
tombed him in the same place where he departed, with
as much ceremony as any Welch goat that has been in-
terred about the high mountain Penmanmawr.
I think it was now the twenty-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts were much easier than formerly, having
contrived several pretty amusements and diversions to
pass away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time
my pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and pro-
nounce his words very articulately and plain; so that for
hours we used to chat together after a familiar manner,
and he lived with me no less than twenty-six years. My
dog, which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which he
lived with me, died some time ago of mere old age. As
for my cats, they multiplied so fast, that 1 was forced to
kill or drive them into the woods, except two or three
which became my particular favorites. Besides these, I
continually kept two or three household kids about me,
which would feed out of my hand, and two more parrots
that could talk indifferently, and call Robinson Cru.w, but
not so excellently as the first, as not taking that .pains with
them. 1 had also several sca-fowls which I had wounded,
and cut their wings; and growing tame, they used to breed
among the low trees about my castle walls, all which
made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment, of this uncertain state of life, when we leafjj^xpect
them ! it was now in the month of December, in tl*|£§outh-
ern solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which re-
quired my attendance in the fields ; when going out pretty
early one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared
to me, from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two miles
from me at the east end of the island, where I observed
some savages had been before, not on the other side, but
to my great affliction, it was on my side the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements,
I returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after
me, making all things look as wild and natural as I possi-
bly could. In the next place, I pat myself into a posture
of defence, loading my muskets and pistols, and commit-
ting myself to God's protection, I resolved-to defend my-
self till my last breath. Two hours after, impatient* for
intelligence, I set my ladder up to the side of the hill,
where there was a flat place, and then pulling the ladder
after me ascended to the top, where laying myself on my
belly, with my perspective glass, I perceived no less than
nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eating, as I
supposed human flesh, with their two canoes haled on
shore, waiting for the flood to carry them off again. You
cannot easily express the consternation I was in at this
sight, especially seeing them near me; but when I per-
ceived their coming must be always with thecunentofthe
ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts, being fully con-
vinced that I might go abroad with security all the time
of flood, if they were not before landed. And indeed, this
proved just as I imagined ; for no sooner did they all take
boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. W. Before
they went off, they danced, making ridiculous postures,
and gestures for above an hour, all stark-naked; but whe-
ther men or women, or both, I could not perceive. When
I saw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders,
and placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my great
sword, I went to the hill where I first made a discovery of
these cannibals, and then saw there had been three canoes
more of the savages on shore at the place, which with the
rest were making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going
to the place of sacrifice, the blood? the bones, and other
mangled parts of human bodies appeared in my sight;
and soared was I with indignation, that I was fully resolv-
ed to be revenged on the first that came there, though I
lost my life in the execution. It then appeared to me,
that the visits which they make to this island are not very
frequent, it being fifteen months before they came again;
but still I was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal appre-
hensions of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I
offer to fire a gun on that side of the island where they
used to appear, lest taking the alarm, the savages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God knows
in what manner I 6houJd have made my end. Thus was
I a year or more before I saw any of these devouring
cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself on those Heathens.
On the 16th of May (-according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abund-
ance of lightening and thunder all day, and succeeded by
a very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
Boise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a
minute, when with my ladder, ascending the mountain as
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the re-
port of another gun, which I presently heard, and found
-it was from that part of the sea where the current drove
me away. I could not but then think, that this must be
a ship in distress, and that these were the melancholy sig-
nals for a speedy deliverance. Great indeed was my sor-
row upon this occasion; but my labours to assist them
must have proved altogether vain and fruitless. However
I brought together all the dry wood that was at hand, and
making a pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. I
was certain they plainly perceived it, by their firing anoth-
er gun as soon as it began to blaze, and after that several
more from the same quarter. All night long I kept up
my fire: and when the air cleared up, I perceived some-
thing a great way at sea, directly E. but could not distin-
guish what it was, even with my glass, by reason the wca*
ther was so very foggy out at sea. However, keeping my
eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not stijN
I presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor, and so
very hasty I was to be satisfied, that taking the gun, I
went to the S. E. part of the island, to the same rocks
where I had been formely drove away by the current; in
which time the weather being perfectly cleared up to my
great sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a ship cast away
upon those hidden rocks I found when I was out with my
boat; and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the
occasion of my preservation.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another's ruin ; for un-
doubtedly this ship had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived
the island, as now I guessed they had not, certainly, instead
of firing their guns for help, they would rather have ven-
tured in their boat, and saved themselves that way. I then
thought that perhaps they had done* so, upon seeing my
fire, and were cast away in the attempt; for I perceived
no boat in the ship.
But then I again imagined, that perhaps, they had ano-
ther vessel in company, which upon signal, saved their
lives, and took the boat up, or that the boat might be driv-
en into the main ocean, where these poor creatures might
be in the most miserable condition. But as all these conjec-
tures were very uncertain, I could do no more than com-
miserate their distress and thank God for delivering me
in particular, when so many perished in the raging ocean.
When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of them
saved, I cannot explain by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out
in this manner; "O that there had been but two or three,
u nay even one person saved, that we might have lived to-
"gether, conversed with, and comforted one another I" and
so much were my desires moved, that when I-repeated
these words, u Oh I that there had been but one i" my
hands would clench together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands so close, that had any soft thing been
between, it would have crushed it involuntarily, while my
teeth would strike together, and set ag?inst each other
so strong, that it required some time for me to part
them.
Till the last year of my being on this island,* I never
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship.
I had the affliction, some time after, to see the corpse of a
G 2
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island which
was next the shipwreck ; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of opened-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen .shirt, but no particular mark to guess
what nation he was of: in his pocket were two pieces of
eight, and a tobacco-pipe, the last of which I preferred
much more than I did the first.
And now the calmness of the sea tempted me to venture
out in my boat to this wreck not only to get something ne-
cessary out of the ship, but perhaps some living creature
might be on board, whose life I might preserve. This had
such an influence upon my mind, that immediately I went
home and prepared every thing necessary for the voyage,
carrying on board my boat provisions of all sorts, with a
good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a compass, so put-
ting off, I paddled the canoe along the shore, till I came
at last to the north-east part of the island, from whence I
was to launch into the ocean; but here the current ran so
violently, and appeared so terrible, that my heart began lo
fail me; foreseeing that if I was driven into any of these
currents, I might be carried not only out of the reach
or sight of the island, but even inevitably lost in the boil-
ing surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over
my enterprise, sailing to a little creek on the shore, where
stepping out, I set me down on arising hill, very pensive
and thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, which made it impracticable for
me to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how
the sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came
in, I ascended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked
the sea both ways; and here I found that as the current of
the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so
the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the
north side; and all that I had to do, was to keep to the
ijorth of the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with
rny watch coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till I
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as
to take from me all govermcnt of my canoe; so tfa$t in
two hours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared^*
mc a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spamsh
vessel by its building, stuck fasl between two rocks; her
stern and quarter beaten to pieces by the sea; her main-
mast and foremast were brought off by the board, that is
broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog
on board, who seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and no
sooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished with
hunger and thirst, so that when I gave him a cake of bread,
no ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily, and he
drank to that degree of fresh water, that he would have
burst himself, had I suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one
another's arms: hence I very probably supposed, that
when the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessant-
ly did the waters break in and over her, that the men not
being able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rush-
ing in of the waves. There were several casks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay
in the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebb-
ing out of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend
to meddle with, likewise I perceived several chests, which
I supposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got
into my boat, without examining what was in them. Had
the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken
off, I should have made a very prosperous voyage; since,
by what I after found in these two chests, I could not
otherwise conc!ude»but that the ship must have abundance
of wealth on board ; nay if I must guess by the course she
steered, she must have been bound from the Buenos Ay res
or the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts of America,
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the gulph cf
Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. What became of the
rest of the sailors, I could not certainly tell; and ail her
riches signified nothing at that time to any body.
Searching fuither, I found a cask, containing about twen-
ty gallons, full of liquor, which with some labour, I got in-
to my boat; in her cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there, but took away with me a great powder horn,
with about four pounds of powder in it. I took also a fire-
shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron, all which were extremely neces-
sary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so
with thisycargo, accompanied with my dog, I came &way5
the tide serving for that purpose, and the same evening,
about an hour within night, I attained the island, after the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, re-
solving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten in
my new-found subterraneous grotto; and not to carry my
cargo home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed my-
self, and got all my effects on shore, I next proceeded to
examine the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I found
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at
the Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the opening of
the chest, several things appeared very useful to me; for
instance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles, contain-
ing the fine and best sorts of cordial waters ; each bottle
held about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I found
also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and two more
which the water had utterly spoiled. There were likewise
several good shirts exceedingly welcome to me, and about
one dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs and colour-
ed neckcloths, the former of which was absolutely neces-
sary for wiping my face in a hot day; and in the till, found
three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all,
in one of which, decently wrapped up in apiece of paper,
were six doubloons of gold, and some small bars and wedg-
es of the same metal, which I believe might weigh near
a pound: in the other chest, which I guessed to belong to
the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstances which at-
tended it, I found only some clothes of very little value,
except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three
flasks, kept as I believe, for charging their fowling-pieces
on any occasion ; so that, on the whole? I had no great ad-
vantage by this voyage.
The money was indeed as mere dirt tome, useless and
unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted with for
two or thi ee pair of English shoes and stockings,things that
for many years I had not worn, except lately those which I
had taken off the feet of those unfortunate men that were
drowned in the wreck, yet not so good as English shoes ei-
ther for ease or service. I also found in the seaman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold ; so conclud-
ed th it what I took from the first belonged to an officer^ihe.
latter appearing to have a much inferior person forks own*
er. However, as despicable as the money seemed, ! like-
wise lugged it to my cave, laying it up securely, as I did
the rest of my cargo, and after all this was done, I return-
ed back to my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I
came to my old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and
so made the best of my way to my castle : when I arrived
there, every thing seemed safe and quiet, so that now my
only business was to repose myself after my wonted man-
ner and take care of my domestic affairs. But though I
might have lived very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely
needful; yet still I was more vigilant than usual upon ac-
count of the savages, never going much abroad, or if I did,
it was to the east part of the island, where I was well as-
sured that the savages never came, and where I might not
be troubled to carry that heavy load of weapons for my de-
fence, as I was obliged to do ifl went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all
which time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head
was filled with nothing but projects and designs, how I
might escape from this island; and so much were my
wandering thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition that
had I had the same boat that I went from Sallee in, I
should have ventured once more to the uncertainty of the
raging ocean.
I cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the
unhappy persons, who make themselves wretched by their
dissatisfaction with the stations which God has placed them
in; for, not to take a review of my primitive condition,
and my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to
which was, as I may say, my original sin, the following
mistakes of the same nature certainly had been the means
of my present unhappy station. What business had I to
leave a settled fortune, and well stocked plantation, im-
proving and increasing, where, by this time, I might have
been worth a hundred thousand moidores, to turn super-
cargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when time and patience
would so much enlarge my stock at home, as to be able
to employ those whose more immediate business it was
to fetch them home even to my door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads, so a
serious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily attends the
exercise of future years, when the dear bought experience
of time teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me ; out
notwithstanding the.thoughts of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dic-
tates of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in my
kind reader with greater pleasure to the remaining part
of my relation, I flutter myself it will not be taken amiss,
to give him an account of my first conceptions of the man-
ner of escaping, and upon what foundation I laid down my
foolish schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my lale voyage to the
ship, my frigate laid up and secured as usual, and my con-
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I
had as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had
for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them:
one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and
twentieth year of solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well in
health, without distemper, pain or uncommon uneasiness,
either of body or mind; yet notwithstanding, I could not
compose myself to sleep all the night long. All this
tedious while it is impossible to express what innumera-
ble thoughts came into my head.
I traced quite over the whole history of my life in min-
iature, from my utmost remembrance of things till I came
to this island, and then proceeded to examine every action
and passage that had occurred since I had taken possession
of my kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the begin-
ning of my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear and concern,
since I had discovered a print of a foot in the sand; that
while I continued without apprehension, I was incapable
of feeling* the dread and terror I now suffered. How thank-
ful rather ought I to have been for the knowledge of my
danger, since the greatest happiness one can be possessed
of is to have sufficient time to provide against it I How
stupendous is the goodness of Providence, which sets.such
narrow bounds to the sight and knowledge of human na-
ture, that while men walk in the midst of so many dan-
gers they are kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from their eyes and knowing nothing of
those many dangers that surround them, till perhaps they
are dissipated and vanish awa*£.
When I came more particularly to consider of the real
clanger I had for so many years escaped, how I walked
about in the greatest security and tranquility, at a time per-
haps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree
or the common approach of night, had interposed between
rne and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who would
devour mc with as good an appetite, as I would &pigeon or
curlew; surely all this, I say, could not but make me
sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose singular
protection I acknowledge with the greatest humility, and
without which I must inevitably have fallen into the cruel
hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest man-
ner, according to my weak understanding, I next proceed-
ed to consider the wretched nature of those destroying
savages, by seeming, though with a great reverence, to in-
quire why God should give up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind?
but as this was rather matter of obstruse speculation, and
as my miserable situation made me think thisof mine the
most uncomfortable situation in the world, I then began
rather to inquire what part of the world these wretches
lived in; how far off the coast was from whence they
came; why they ventured over so far from home; what
kind of boats conveyed them hither; and why I could
not order myself and my business so, that I might be as
able to attain their country, as they were to come to my
kingdom.
But then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when
I come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the
hands of the savages ? or how shall I escape from them,
if they make an attempt upon me? and supposing I
should not fall into their power, what shall I do for provi-
sion, or which way shall I bend my course? those counter
thoughts threw me into the greatest horror and confusion
imaginable; but then I looked upon my present condi-
tion to be the most miserable that possibly could be, and
that nothing could be worse, except death. For, thought
I, could I but attain the shore of the main, I might per-
haps meet with some relief, or coast it along as I did with
my boy Xury, on the African shore, till I came to some
inhabited country, where I might meet with some relief,
or fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in;
and if I failed, why then I could but meet with death,
which would put an end to all my miseries. These
thoughts, 1 must confess, were the fruits of a distempered
mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it were,
by long continuance of the troubles and disappointments I
had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have found
some living person to speak to, by whom I might hav^e
known in what place I was, and of the probable means of
xny deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitat-
ed, my resignation to the will of Heaven was entirely sus-
pended! so that I had no power to fix my mind to any
thing, but to the project of a voyage to the main land.
And indeed so much was I inflamed upon this account,
that it set my blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high
as though I had been in a fever; till nature being as it
were, fatigued and exhausted with the thoughts of it, made
me submit myself to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange that I did not
dream of what I was so intent upon; but instead of it, my
mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether foreign.
I dreamed that as I was issuing from my castle one morn-
ing, as customary, when I perceived upon the shore two
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who brought
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make
a sacrifice of, in order to devour ; but just as they were
going to give the fatal blow, methought the poor designed
victim jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick
grove before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies,
when perceiving that the others did not follow him that
way, I appeared to him ; that he humbly kneeled down
before me, seeming to pray for my assistance; upon
which I showed him my ladder, made him ascend, carri-
ed him to my cave, and he became my servant; and when
I had gotten this man, I said to myself, now surely I may
have some hopes to attain the main land ; for this fellow
will serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I
must go for prousions, what places to shun, what to ven-
ture to, and what to escape. But when I awaked, and
found all these inexpressible impressions of joy entirely
vanished, I fell into the greatest dejection of spirit ima-
ginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure
way of escaping was to get a savage; that after I had ven-
tured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his
devourers, the natural sense he might have of such a pre-
servation, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and
most sincere affection. But then this objection reasonably
interposed how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack
a whole company of them, and kill them all? why should
I proceed on such a desperate attempt, which my scru-
ples before had suggested to be unlawful? and indeed my
heart trembled at the thoughts of so much blood, though
it were a means to procure my deliverance. 'Tis true, I
might reasonably enough suppose these men to be real
enemies to my life, men who would devour me, was it in
their power; so that it was self preservation in the high-
est degree to free myself, by attacking them in my own
defence as lawfully as if they were actually assaulting me:
though all these things, I say, seemed to me to be of the
greatest weight, yet, as I just said before, the dreadful
thoughts of shedding human blood, struck such a ten or
to my souK that it was a long time before I could recon-
cile myself to it.
But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on?
for notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities I
bad with myself, I at length resolved, right or wroiv^, to
get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it
would, or even though I should lose my life in the attempt.
Inspired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work,
to find out what methods I should take to answer my de-
sign: this indeed, was so difficult a task, that I could not
pitch upon any probable means to execlite it, I therefore,
resolved continually to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive
when the savages came on shore, and to leave the rest to
the event, let the opportunities offer as they would.
Such was my fixed resolution ; and accordingly set my-
self upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time as I
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year an<J a
half, the greatest part of which I went out to the uest and
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look
for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great dis-
couragement; yet, though I was very much concerned,
the edge of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer
3t seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I for it; in a
word, I never before was so careful to shun the loathing
sight of these savages, as I now was eager to be with them*
and 1 thought myself sufficiently able to manage one, two
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make the in my
entire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct them, and
prevent their being able at any time to do me a mibchief.
Many times did I use to please myself with these thoughts^
with long and ardent expectations; but nothing present-
ing, all my deep projected schemes and numerous fanrie$-
vanished away, as though, while I retained such thoughts',
the decree of Providence was such, that no savages were
tti coaxe near me.
II
About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mu-
sing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one
morning early I was very much surprised by seeing no less
than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the is-
land, and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and
out of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all
my measures; for seeing so many boats, each of which
"would contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell
what to think of it, or how to order my measures, to attack
twenty or thirty men single-handed; upon which, much
dispirited and perplexed, 1 lay still in my casile; which,
however, I put in a proper posture for an attack, and hav-
ing formerly provided all that was necessary, was soon
ready to enter upon an engagement, should they attempt.
Having waited for some time, my impatient temper would
let me bear it no longer; I set my guns at the foot of my
ladder, and as usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at
two stages, standing, however, in such a manner, that my
head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not
easily perceive me ; and here, by the assistance of my per-
spective glass, I observed no less than thirty in number
around a fire, feasting upon what meat they had dtesscd,
how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not then per-
fectly tell; but they were all dancing and capering about
the flames, using many frightful and barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eve, 1 was beholding these
wretches, my spirit sunk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as 1 supposed they had done
before.
It was not long before one of them fell upon the ground,
knocked down, as 1 supposed, with a club or wooden sword>
for that was their manner; while two or three others
Went immediately to work, cutting him open for their
cookery, and then fell to devour him as they had done the
former, while the last unhappy capthe was left by himself,
till such time as they were ready for him. The poor crear
lure looked round with a wishful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death; yet, seeing himself a little at liberty},
nature, that \cry moment, as it were, inspired him with
hopes of iife; he started away from them, and ran with,
inn edible swiftness along the sands, directly to that p;-<rt
of the coast where my ancient and venerable castle V.ood .
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully frightened up-
on this occasion, when as I thought, they pursued him in
a whole body, all running towards my p£dace. And now,
indeed, I expected that part of my dream was going to bo
fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove for
protection; but for the rest of my dream, I could depend
nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him thither,
and find him there. However, my sph its beginning to re-
cover, I still kept upon my guard ; and I now plainly per-
ceived, there were but three men out'of the number that
pursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what swiftness
the poor creature ran from his pursuers gaining so much
ground upon them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus
hold out for half an hour, there was not the least doubt but
he would save his life from the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a creek, that
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the
wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very much
feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could not swim
for his escape: But soon was I out of pain foi\him, when
I perceived he made nothing of it, though at full tide, but
with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the sense of dan-
ger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over in about
thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the same incre-
dible strength and swiftness as before. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, oneof them, who I perceived
could not swim, happily for his part, returned to his com-
pany, while the others, wiih equal courage, but mufch less
swiftness, attained the other side, as though they were re-
solved never to give over the pursuit.
And now or never I thought was the time for me to pro-
cure me a servant, companion, or assistant; and th?.t- Ik
was decreed by Providence to be the instrument to sav*3
this poor creature's life. I immediately descended my two'
ladders with the greatest expedition; I took up my two
guns which I said before, were ai the bottom of tbcmyaiid
getting up again vyith the same haste towards the hi U X
made nearer the sea: in a word, taking a shoit cut denyn
the hill, I interposed bet-ween the pursuers and pursued,
hallooing aloud to the latter, v\rfo venturing to look b*4ck?
was no doubt as much terrified at me js*I at him. I beck-
oned to him with my hand, to return back, in the mean-
time advancing towards the pursuers, and rmhiag m> the
foremo&t, I knocked him down with the stock of tuy p&cf f
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to
fire lest the rest should hear, though at a distance, I
questioned whether they could or no, and being out of
sight of the smoke, they could not easily have known what
to make of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall,
stoppedas if he had been amazed; when advancing to-
wards him. I could perceive him take his bow from his
back, and fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at
me, and without dispute, might have lodged the arrow in
my breast; but, in this absolutely necessary case of seif-
prcservation, I immediatelyYired at him, and shot him
dead, just as his hand was going to draw the fatal string.
All this while, the savage who had fled before stood still,
and had the satisfaction to see his enemies killed, as he
thought, who designed to takeaway his life ; so affrighted
was he with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
as it were like Lot's wife, tixed and immoveable, without
either sense or motion. This obliged me to halloo to
him again, making the plainest signs I could to him to
draw nearer. 1 perceived he understood those tokens by
bis approaching to me a little way, when, as if afraid I
should kill him too, he, stopped again. Several times did
he advance, and as often stop in this manner, till coming
xridflfiuto my view,I perceived him trembling, as if he was to
undergo the same fate. Upon which I looked uponJaim
with a smiling countenance, and still beckoning to him, at
length he came close to me and kneeled down, kissed the

set it on his head; and this, as I understood afterwards,
^v/as a token of swearing to be my slave forever. I took him.
\m, and making much of him, encouraged him in the best
manner I could. But my work was not yet finished, for I
.perceived the savage whom I knocked down, was not killed
t)bt stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself.
Upon which 1 pointed to my new servant, and showed him
rjthut his enemy was not yet expired, he spoke some words
•o me, but which I could not understand; yet being the
first sound of a man's voice I had heard for above twenty-
£he years, they were very pleasing to me. But there was
lno time for reflection now, the wounded savage recovering.
* himself so far asttf> sit upon the ground, which made my
poor prisoner as much afraid as before; to put him out$£
•whk't fear, I presented my other gun at the man, with aa
"uUeiit to, shoot him 5 but my savage, for so I must mn.
call him, prevented my firing, by making a motion to me,
to lend him my sword, which hung naked in my "belt -by
my side.
No sooner did I grant his request, but away he runs to
his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as dexirously
as the most accomplished executioner in Germany could
have done; for it seems, these creatures make use of
wooden swords made of hard wood which will bear edge
enough to cut off heads and arms atone blow. When this
valorous exploit was done, he comes to me laughing, as a
token of triumph, delivered me my sword a^in, with
abundance of surprising gestures, laying it, ^pg wkh the
bleeding and ghastly head of the Indian, at ^ feet.
The greatest astonishment that my new servant con-
ceived was the manner of killing the savage at such a Ch~*
tance without a bow and arrow; and such was his longing-
desire to know it, that he first pointed to the dead catvase
and then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him.
Upon which I bid him go, and as well as I could, made
him sensible I granted his request. But wnen he c^?W

asylum or sanctuary to him.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly
naust this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the viva-
city of spirit and uncommon transports of joy that his de-
liverance occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a buncli
of raisins to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed very
cheerfully, to his exceeding refreshment. I then made
him a convenient bed with a parcel of rice straw, and a
blanket upon it (a bed which I used myself sometimes)
and then pointing to it, made signs for him to lie down to
sleep, upon which the poor creature went to take a wel-
come reposed
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome young fellow,
extremely well made, with strait long limbs, not too large
but tall and well shaped, and as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His countenance had no-
thing in it fierce or surly, hut rather a sort of majesty in
his face ; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all
the sweetness and softness of an European. His hair was
not curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long
and black, with the most beautiful, yet careless tresses
spreading over his shoulders. He hud a very high and
large forehead, with a great vivacity and sparkling sharp-
ness in his eyes. His skin was not so tawny as the Vir-
ginians, Brazilians, or other Americans; but rather of a
bright dun, olive colour, that had something agreeable in
it, though not very easy to give a description of. His face v
_/w;t3 round and plump, with a small nose, very different
from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty small mouth,
thin lips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the driven
snow. In a word, such handsome features and exact sym-
.me-try in every part, made me consider that I had saved
jtiie life of an Indian prince, no less graceful and accom-
plished than the great Oroonoko, whose memorable beha-
viour and unhappy contingencies of life had charmed the
world, lioth to admiration of "his person, and compassion
to his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all my hap pi*-,
ness centered in this, that I had now got a good servant'.;
or companion, to whom as he deserved, I was resolved
orove a kind master and a lasting friend. He had not step?
nhove an hour, when he awakened again, and while I wa$
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from tUe cav£4#K
wards me in my enclosure, and laying himself down on
the ground, in the lowest prostration, made all the antic
gestures imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for
being his deliverer. Though the manner of his behaviour
seemed to be ludicrous enough to excite laughter, yet I
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart
melted within me, fearing he might die away in excess of
joy, like reprieved malefactors'; especially as it was out of
my power either to let him blood, or to administer physic.
It were to be wished, that Christians would take example
by this Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the
benefits and deliverances they have received by the kind
mediation and powerful interposition of their benefactors
and deliverers; and it would be likewise happy for man-
kind, were there no occasion to blame many, who instead
of thankfully acknowledging favours and benefits, rather
abuse and condemn those who have been the instruments
to save them from destruction.
But leaving these just reflections, I return to the object
which occasioned them; for my man, to conclude the last
ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the
ground, close to mt foot, and set my other foot upon his
head as he had done before, making all the signs of sub-
mission, servitude, and subjection imaginable, and let me
understand he would serve me as long as his life endured*..
As I understood him in many things 1 made him sensible
I was very well pleased with him ;, and, in a little time* I
began to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me again.
In the first place I made him understand his name was
to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his life;
then I taught him to say Master, which 1 made him sen-
sible was to he my name. I likewise taught him to
Yes and No, and to know what they meant. I gave Mm
some milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while
I drank it before him, and soaked my bread in it j I gave,,
him a Cake of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise* *
to which he readily consented, making signs of the great*
est satisfaction imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there ; but no sooner did
the morning light appear, when I ordered him to arise*
and come along with me, with certain tokens that I would
give him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed ve-
ry glad, being stark naked, without the least fevering
iriia^eyer. As we passed by the place where th$ Vm men
had been interred, my man pointed directly to their graves
showing me the marks that he had made to find them
again, giving me to understand that we should dig them
up and devour them. At this I appeared extremely dis-
pleased, expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would
vomit at the apprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand
to come away, which he did with the greatest reverence
and submission. After this I conducted him to the top of
the hill, to view if the rest of the savages were yet remain-
ing there; but when I looked through my perspective-
glass, I could see no appearance of them, nor of their
canoes; so that it was very evident they never minded
their deceased companions whom we had slain; which,
if they had, they would surely have searched for, or left
one boat behind for them to follow, after they returned
from their pursuit.
Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, animating me
with courage to see this scene of barbarity, I took my man
Friday with me, putting a sword into his hand, with the
bow and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could
use very dcxtronsly, causing him to carry one gun for me
arid I two for myself; and thus equipped against all at-
tacks, away we marched directly to the place of their
bloody entertainment. when I came there, I was
struck with the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle,
whilst Friday was no v ays concerned about it. being no
doubt in Ins turn one of those dc\ourers. Here lay se-
veral human bones, there several pieces of mangled flesh,
half eaten, mangled and scorched, whiie streams of blood
ran promiscuously as waters from a fountain. As I was
musing on this dreadful sight, Friday tock all the pains he
could, by particular signs, to make me understand, that
they had brought over four prisoners to feast upon, three
of whom they had eaten up, and that he was the fourth,
pointing to himself; thai there hawng been a bloody bat-
tle between them and his great king, in the just defence
of whom, he was taken prisoner, with many others; all
of these were carried off to different places, to be de-
voured by their conquerors; and that it was his misfor-
tune to he brought lather by these wretches for the same
purpose, [
Aftei I was made sensible of these things, I caused
Friday to gather those horrid remains, and lay them to J
gether upon a heap, which I ordered^ to be set on fire**
and burnt them to ashes: My man, however still retained
the nature of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach af-
ter some of the nesh; but such an extreme abhorrence
did I express at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not but conceal it; for I made him very sensible, that if
in future, he offered any such thing, I would ceitainly
shoot hirn.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my cas-
tle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had
taken out of the poor gunner's chest before mentioned;
and which with a little alteration, fitted him very well:
in the next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such
as my skill was able to manage, and indeed I thought my-
self then a tolerable good tailor. I also gave him a cap
which was made of a hare's skin, very convenient and
fashionable. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man;
was no less proud of his habit, than I was in seeing him
in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly about at first, the
drawers being too heavy on his thighs, not used to bear
any weight, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders and the inside of his arms ; but by a little eas-
ing where he complained they hurt him, and by using
himself to them, at length he look to them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy
myself, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place be-
tween my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and'
outside of the first; and as there was an entrance or door
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a
door to open on the inside; I barred it up in the night-
time, taking in my ladders too, so that was my man to
prove treacherous, there could be no way to come at me
in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me;
for my first wall had now a complete roof over it, of long
poles, spreading overbuy tent, and leaning up to the side
of the mountain, which was again kid cross with smaller
sticks instead of laths, and thatched over a great thickness
^vith the rice straw, which was as strong as reeds; and
at the hole of the place left on purpose to go in or out by
the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap door, which, if it
had been attempted on the out side, would not have open-
ed at all, but have fallen down, and made a great noise %
and its to my weapons, every night I took them all to my
bedside.
But there was no occasion for this precaution ; for surely
never master had a more sincere, faithful, and losing ser-
vantahan Friday proved to me : without passion, sullenness
or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affections
were as much lied to me, as those of a child to its parents;
and I might venture to say, he would have saciifkcd his
life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
And indeed the many testimonies he gave me of this suf-
ficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use these
precautions. And here I could not but reflect with great
wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty in his
providence, and in the government of the creation, to take
from so great a pait of the world of his creatures, the no-
blest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of their
souls are adapted ; yet that he has bestowed upon them
the same reason, affections, sentiments of kindness and
obligation, passions and resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he lias
given us ; and that when he is graciously pleased to offer
them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay,
more ready to apply tl.em to the proper uses for which
they were bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts
would make me melancholy, especially when I considered
how mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of this world, as an addition to our
understanding; and why it has pleased the heavenly wis-
dom to conceal the like saving knowledge fiom so many
millions of souls, who would certainly make a much bet-
ter use of it than generally mankind do at this time. These
reflections would sometimes lead me so far, as to invade
the sovereignty of Providence, and As it were arraign the
justice of such an arbitrary disposition of things, that ob-
scures that light from some, and yet expects a like duty
from all. But I closed it up, checking my thoughts with
this conclusion: first, That we were ignorant of that right
and law by uhich those should he condemned; hut as the
Almighty was necessarily and by the nature of his essence
infinitely just and holy; so it could not be otherwise, but
that if ti.cse creatures were all destined to absence from
himself, it was on account of sinning against that light
which, as the Sciipiurc says, was a law to themselves,,
and by suxh rules as their consciences would acknowledge;
to be jiutr . kough the first foundation was not discovered
us. And secondly, that still as we were the clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, 44 Why
"hast thou fashioned me after this manner l"
I had not been above two or three days returned to my
castie, but* my chief design was, how I should bring Friday
off from this horrid way of feeding, and to take from him
that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to,
I thought it my duty to let him taste other Mesh, which
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so
often expressed against their accursed way of living. Up-
on which, one morning ; took him out with me, with ail
intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring^it home,
and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Im-
mediately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding
him stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, ar.d
shot one of the kids. My poor servant, who had at a dis-
tance perceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not
know by what means, or how it was done, stood trembling
and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I thought he
would have sunk into the earth. He did not sec the kid I
aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but ripped up his waist-
coat to bee if he was not wounded, thinking my resolution
was to kill him; for coming to me, he fell on hib knees,
earnestly pronouncing many things which I did not under-
stand the meaning of; which at length 1 perceived was,
that i would not take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to see him in that con-
dition, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the
immediate hand of death is ready to put forever a period
to this mortal life; and indeed so much compassion had I
to this creature, thai it was with difficulty I refrained from
tears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was
necessary, and to convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, tnen laughed at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had stain, made signs
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less cu-
rious-was he in viewing how the cieature was killed, than *
he had been before in beholding the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and pre-
sently perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching upon
a tree within shot; and therefore, to let Friday understand
what I was going to do, I called him to me agnm, point-
ing ttt the fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made
him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird; ac-
cordingly I fired, and bade him look, when immediately
he saw the parrot fall clown. Again he stood like one
amazed, notwithstanding all I had said to him: and the
more confounded he was, because he did not perceive me
put any thing into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so ut-
terly strange, carrying death along with it, far or near, ei-
ther to man or beast, must certainly create the greatest
astonishment to one who never had heard such a thing in
his whole life; and really his amazement continued so
long, that had 1 allowed it, he would have prostrated him-
self before me and my gun, with the greatest worship and
adoration. As for the gun in particular, he would not so
much as touch it for several days after, but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if the
senseless piece had understood and answered him ; all this
I could perceive him do, when lie thought my back was
turned, the chief intent of which was, to desire it not to
kill nim, as 1 afterwards came to understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions;
but when his astonishment was-a little over, I made tokens
to him to run and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which
accordingly he did, staying some time longer than usual,
bv reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some
w§jKurther from the place where she fell: in the mean
«pe, as he was looking for her, I took the advantage of
iBlarging my gun again, that so I might be ready for any
other mark that offered; but nothing more occurred at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
took off the skin, and divided the carcase as well as I could.
Part of the ficsh I stewed and boiled in a pot I had for this
purpose. And then spreading my table, I sat down, giv-
ing my man some of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleas-
ed, and seemed to like it very well: but what was the
most surprising to him was to see me cat salt with it: up-
on which he made me understand, that the /salt was very
bad for me; when putting a little into his mouth, he seem-
e l to nauseate it in such a manner, as to spit and sputter
a. it, and then washed his mouth with fresh water: but to
s iow him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit aiit}
sputter as much for the want of it, as he had done at it>
yet all this proved of no signification to Friday ; and it was'
a long while before he could endure salt in his meat or
broth, and even then but a small quantity.
Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast
him with a roasted piece of the kid. And having no spit
to fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of that common
artifice which many of the common people of England
have, that is to set two poles upon each side of the fire, and
one cross on the top, hanging the meat thereon with a
string, and so turning round continually, roast it, in the
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly roast-
ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira-
tion it! my man Friday, being quite another way than that
to which the savages were accustomed. But when he came
to taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he ex-
pressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different
ways: and as I could not but understand his meaning, you
may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when
he made it also very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my servant to work;
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in
the same manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the execution of any-
thing I ordered him to go about. I made him undersuu4
that it was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwar&;||t
him see me make it; in short, he did every thing as I^Sir
dered him, and in a little time as well as I could perform
it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths to feed in-
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than common; upon which I marked out a larger piece
of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as I had done
before; in the execution of which I must give Friday this
gnod word, that no man could work more hardy, or with
a better will than he did; and when 1 made him sensible
that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he then
very passionately made me understand, that he thought
I had much more labour on his account, than for my-
self; and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in
him* if I would but direct him in those works wherein he
might proceed.
98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I must certainly own, that this was the most pleasn
year I ever had in the island; for after some time, Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those
things which I was wont to call for, and the places where
I used to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which
had been useless so many years, except in an exclamatory
manner, either for deliverance or blessings, now began to
be occupied in teaching, and talking to my man Friday;
for indeed I had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself, so innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear more and more to me every day, that I really began
entirely to love him; and for his part, I believe there was
no love lost, and that his nature had been more charmed
by his exceeding kindness, and his affections more placed
upon me, than any other object whatsoever among his own
countrymen. I once had a great mind to try if he had any
hankering inclination to his own country again; and by
this time having learned the English so well, that he
could give me tolerable answers to any question which I
demanded. I asked him whether that nation to which he
belonged, ever conquered in battle ? This question made
Friday to smile, and to which he answered, u Yes, yes, we
"always fight the better as much as to say, they always
got the better in the fight. Upon which we proceeded on
the following discourse: You say, said I, that you always
fitfht the better; why then, Friday, how came you to be
taken prisoner^
Friday. But for all that my nation beat much.
Master. How say you, beat? if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They many more mans than my nation in the
place where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three
grove tousand.
Maftttr. Then why did not your men recover you from
the hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me ; they
make all go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.
Master. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your
nation do with the prisoners they take? Do they camy
them away and eat them as these have clone? *
Friday, Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up*ail.
. Master. To what place do they carry them to be de-
voured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Master. Do they bring them hither?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place.
Master. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here (pointing to the north-west
of the island^ being the side where they used to land.)
Thus having gotten what account I could from my man,
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly'among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of
the island, upon the same bloody occas||j| as he was
brought hither for; and some time after I carried him to
that place where he pointed, and no sooner did he come
there, but he presently knew the ground, signifying to me
that he was once there wh.cn they ate up twenty men, two
women and a young child; but as he could not explain the
number in English, he did it by so many stones in a row,
making a sign to me to count them.
This passage I have the rather mentioned, because it
led to things more important and useful for me to know;
for after I had this satisfactory discourse with him, my
next question was, how far it was from the island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost in the
ocean? to which he answered there was no danger; that
no canoes were ever lost: but that after a little way out
to the sea, there was a strong current, and a wind always
one way in the afternoon. This I thought at first to be no
more than the sets of the tide, of going out, or coming
in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the
great draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in the mouth or gulph of which I imagined my kingdom
lay; and that the land which I perceived to the W. and
N. W. must be the great island Trinidad, on the north
of the river. A thousand questions (if that would satisfy
me) did I ask Friday about the nature of the country, the
sea, the coast, the inhabitants, and what nations were
nearest them; to which questions the poor fellow declared
all he kr.ew, with the greatest openness and utmost sin-
cerity, When I demanded of him the particular names
of the various nations of his sort of people, he could only
answe>* me in general, that they were called Caradee.
Hence it was that I considered they must be the Carib-
bees, so much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that
part of America which reaches from the mouth of the ri-
ver Oroonoko to Guiana, and so up to St. Martha. Then
Friday proceeded to tell me that up a great way beyond
the moon, as much as to say beyond the setting of the
moon, which must be west from their country, there
dwelt white bearded men, such as I was, pointing to my
whiskers, and that they kill much mans, I was not igno-
rant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated these crea-
tures; so that I presently concluded it must be them,
"whose cruelties had spread so much throughout the con-
tinent of America, as to be remembered even to succeed-
ing generations.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the im-
perfect knowledge of my man had led me to, was very
comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him
how 1 might depart from this island, and get among those
white men? He told me, u Yes, yes, I might go in two
"canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean? surely he means one for himself, and another for
me; and if not, how must two canoes hold me without
being joined, or one part of my body being put into one,
and another in another? and indeed it was a long time
before I understood his meaning, which was, that it must
be a large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear whh
the waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed with them
as a small one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what may be hap-
py, if people would but endeavour for their part to make
it so. He is not the happiest man that has the most riches.
But he that is content with what he hath. Before I had
my servant, I thought myself miserable till I had him:
and now that I had enjoyed the happy beneiits of him, I
still complained, and begged a deliverance from a place of
retirement, ease and plenty, where Providence had suffi-
ciently blessed me. In a word, from this time I entertain-
ed some hopes that one time or other I might find an op-
portunity to make my escape from this island, and that
this poor savage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the time since my man became so intelligent as to
understand and speak to me, I spared no pains or .dili-
gence to instruct him, according to my poor share of
knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the adoration
that he ought to pay to the frue God. One time, a$ I
^ery well remember, I asked him who made him? At
first the innocent.creature did not understand what I
meant, but rather thought I asked him who was his fa-
ther? upon which I took another way to make him sen-
sible, by demanding from him an answer to this question.
Friday, said I, who is it that made the sea, this ground
whereon we walk, and ail these hills and woods which we
behold? And here indeed I did not miss my intention;
for he told me it was old Benamuckee (the God whom I
supposed these savages adored) who lived a great way be-
yond all. But as to his attributes, poor Friday was an ut-
ter stranger. He could describe nothing of this great per-
son ; and all that he could say was that he was very old,
much older than the sea and land, the moon, or the stars,
Friday, said I again, if this great and old person has made
all things in the world, how comes it to pass that all things
as you in particular, do not adore and worship him t upon
this looking very grave, with a perfect sweet look of inno-
cence, he replied, " Master, all things say O 1 to him,'*7
by which it may reasonably be supposed he meant adora-
tion. And where, said I, do the people of your country-
go when they die? He answered to Benamuckee. What,,
and those people that are eaten up, do they go there
"Benamuckee," said he, " love 'em dearly; me pray to
"Benamuckee in the canoe, and Benamuckee would love
u me when dey eat me all up."
Such discourses as these I had with my man, and such:
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped tho**
under imperfect similitudes; and that the false adoration
which the heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as>
great an argument of the divine essence, as the most
learned Atheists (falsely so called) can bring against it £
for God will be glorified in his works, let their rfenomina*-'
tion be what it will; and I cannot be of that opinion-
which some conceive, that God should decree men to b^
damned for want of a right notion of faith, in a place
"where the wisdom of the Almighty has not permitted it.
to be preached; and therefore cannot but conclude, that,
since obedience is the best sacrifice* these poor creatures,*
acting by that light and knowledge which they are possess-
ed of, may undoubtedly obtain a happy^alvation* $houghi
not that enjoyment with Christ, as his saints, confessors^
aud martyrs must enjoy.
^ But laying these determinations aside, more fit for di-
vines than me to discuss, I began to instruct my servant in
the saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the di-
rections of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my
hands to heaven, and pointing thereto, told him that the
Great Maker of Heaven and earth lived there; that as
his infinite power fashioned this world out of a confused
chaos, and made it in that beautiful frame which we be-
hold, so he governs and preserves it by his unbounded
knowledge, sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence;
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give
every thing to us, and take every thing away from us;
that he was a rewarder and punisher of good and evil ac-
tions; that there was nothing but what he knew, no
thoughts so secret but what he could bring to light; and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him
the manner of the creation of the world, the situation of
Paradise, the transgression of our first parents, the wick-
edness of God's peculiar people, and the universal sins
and abominations of the whole earth. When these things
were implanted in his mind, I told him that as God's jus-
tice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to destroy, this
world, till his Son, Jesus Christ interposed in our behalf;
and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of his hea-
venly father to come down from heaven, into the world,
where he took human nature upon him, instructed us in
our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins *r
that he was now ascended into heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining all those
good benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and
hearty prayers, all which were heard at the throne of
Heaven. As very frequently I used to inculcate things
into his mind, Friday one day told me that if our great
God could hear us beyond the sun, he must surely be a
greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little
way off, and yet could not hear them till they ascended
the great mountains where he lived, to speak to him.
What, said I, Friday, did you go thither to speak to him
too I He answered, " No, they never went that were
"young men, none but aid men, called their Oowakakee,"
meaning the lnd^n priests, " who went to say O 1" and
thus he called their prayers," they returned back, and
"told them what Benamuckee said." From hence, I couM
not but observe how happy we Christians are, who hav«
God's immediate revelation for our certain guide; and
that our faith is neither misled, nor our reason imposed
on, by any set of men, similar to these Indian impostors.
But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday,
I told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going
up to the mountain to say O! to their God Benamuckee,
was an imposture, and that their bringing back an answer
was all a sham, if not worse; for that if there was any
such thing spoken to them, it must doubtless proceed
from an infernal spirit. And here I thought it necessary
to enter into a long discourse with him, which I did after
this manner.
Friday, said I, you must know, that before this world
was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by
whose power all things were made, and whose Majesty
shall have no end. To be glorified and adored by beings
of a heavenly nature, he created angels and archangels,
that is glorified spirits, resembling himself, to encompass
his throne, eternally singing forth his praise in the most
heavenly sounds and divine harmony. And among this
heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as then being
one of the peculiar favorites of these celestial abodes ; but
he, contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign,
with unbounded ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not on-
ly envied him that adoration which was his due, but
thought to usurp^ that throne which he had neither power
to keep nor title to pretend to. He raised a dissention and
civil war in heaven, and had a number of angels to take
his part. Unbounded folly i stupendous pride! to hope
for victory, and aspire above his powerful Creator 1 The
Deity, not fearful of such an enemy, yet justly provoked
at this rebellion, commissioned his archangel Michael to
lead forth the heavenly host, and give him battle; the ad-
vantage of which vas quickly perceived, by Satan's being
overthrown, and the prince of the air, for so the devil is
called, with all his fallen angels, driven headlong into a
dismal place, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the great-
est attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his
gestures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole.
And then I desired him to give great heed to what I had
further to say.
No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from* and the
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and
were equal to him in power and glory, Come let us make
man^ said he in our own image, after our own likeness, Gen.
i. 26. to have dominion over the creatures of the world
which we have created. And these he intended should
glorify him in Heaven, according to their obedience in this
state of probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be tha
school to train them up for these heavenly mansions.
Now Satan seeing himself foiled; yet that God had taken
the power from him as prince of the air, which power
Heaven designed he should retain, whereby his creatures
might be tried ; in revenge for the disgrace he had receiv-
ed, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden. He
appears to her in the shape of a serpent, then a most
beautiful creature, and tells her that it was no better than
an imposition, which God had put upon her and her hus-
band, not to eat of that fair fruit which he had created;
that the taste thereof would make them immortal like
God himself; and consequently as great and powerful as
he. Upon which she not only eat thereof herself, but
made her husband eat also, which laid them both under
the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern: "Ah, poor
M mans i" cried he, "naughty womans! naughty devil!
"make God not love de mans, make mans like devil
« himself/'
Frida^, said I, God still loved mankind, and though the
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not suffer
him to have an absolute power over them. I have told you
before of his tender love to his people, till they, like Luci-
fer, disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him;
and even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save
sinners.. But still every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds,
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in
our destruction. What ever evil thoughts we have, pro-
ceed from him; so that God, in this our distress, expects.;
we should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer for;);
speedy redress. He is not like Bmamuckee, to let none
come near him but Oowakakee, but suffers the people as
well as priests to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to
be delivered from the power and temptation of the devih.
But though at first my man Friday expressed some con-
cern at the wickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy
to impriut the right notions of him in his mind, as it was
about the divine essence of God ; for there nature assist-
ed me in all my arguments, to show to him plainly the
necessity of a great first cause, and over-ruling, governing
power, of a secret directing Providence, and of the equity
and reasonableness of paying adoration to our Creator;
whereas there appeared nothing of all this in the notion
of an evil spirit, of his first beginning, his nature, and,
above all, of his inclination to evil actions, and his power to
tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned Indian^
by the mere force of nature, puzzled me with one parti-
cular question, more than ever I could have expected.
I had, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the
omnipotent power of God, and his infinite abhorrence of
sin, in so much that the Scriptures styled him a consuming-
Jire to all the workers of iniquity; and that it was in his
power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the world in a
moment, the greater part of which are continually offend-
ing him.
When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great
while to what I said, after telling him how the devil was
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice
and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and des-
troy the kingdo.n of Christ in the world, and so forth:
"Very well, Master," said Friday, " you say God is so
"strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier
"than the naugty devil ?" Tooe sure, Friday, said I, God
is more wise and stronger than the serpent: he is above
the devil, which makes us pray to him, that he would tread
down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. "Why then,**
answered Friday quickly, u if God, as you say, has much
"strong, much might as the devil, why God no kill devil,
"make no more tempt, no more do wicked."
You may be certain, I was strangely surprised at this
question of my man's : and though an old man, I was but a
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a cau-
suist, or a resolver of intricate doubts in religion ; and as it
required some time for me to study an answer* I, pre tend-
ed not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said; but so
earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question,'' *
which he repeated in the very same broken words as above,
When I had recovered myself a little , Friday, said I, God
will at last punish him severely, being reserved for judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to remain
in fire everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday; for,
returning upon me, he repeated my words, " reserve at
a last, me no understand; but why not kill devil now,
"not kill devil, great, greut while ago ?" Friday, said I,
you may as well ask me why God does not kill you and me,
"when by our wicked actions, we so much offend his divine
Majesty? He gives us lime 10 repent of our sins, that
thereby we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain
fiardon, Friday mused a great while : and at last, looking
me sledfastly in the face, " Well, well," said he, " that's
"very well; so you, I, devil, all wicked mans, all pre-
"serve, repent, God pardon all."
Indeed, here I was run down to the last extremity, when
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a De-
ity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God;
but however, nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemptiompurchased
for us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an in-
tercessor at the footstool of God's throne, and therefore,
the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; that is,
the word and Spirit of God, promised for the guide and
^anctifier of his people, are the most necessary instructors
of the souls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Al-
mighty, and the means to attain eternal happiness.
And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis-
course between my man and me; for which purpose 1 rose
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go out,
sending Friday for something that was a good way off'. I
then fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would
inspire rne so far as to guide this poor savage in the know-
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that
his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and
his soul saved. When he returned again, I entered into a
very long discourse with him, on the subject of the world's
redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repen-
tance preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith
of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then I proceed-
ed to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the
reason why our Saviour took not on him the nature of an*
gels, but rather the seed of Abraham; and how the fklba
angels had no benefit by that redemption; and lastly*that
he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israeh" and
the like. God knows I had more sincerity than knowledge
in all the ways I took for the poor Indian's instruction; and
I must acknowledge what I believe,every body that acts up-
on the same principle will find, that in laying heavenly
truths open before him,I informed and instructed myself in
many things that either I did not know, or had not perfectly-
considered before; so that, however, this poor creature
might be improved by my instructions, certain it is, that
I myself had great reason to be thankful to Providence for
sending him to me. His company allayed my grief, and
made my habitation comfortable; and when I reflected that
the solitary life to which I had been so long confined, had
made me to look further towards Heaven, by making me
the instrument under Providence, to save the life, and for
ought I know, the soul of this poor savage, by bringing
him to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret
joy to spread through every part of my soul; and I fre-
quently rejoiced, that ever I was brought to this place,
which I once thought the most miserable part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards conti-
nue, while I abode on the island, and for three years did
my man and I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness.
Indeed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I;
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the
right way, as much as if we had been on the English
shore.
By the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured
to make him understand every part of it, as much as fay.
in my power. He also, on the other hand, by his very se-
rious questions and enquiries, made me a much better pro-
ficient in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by
my own private reading and study. I must not omit ano-
ther thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my\.rek
tirement. It was that infinite and inexpressible blessmgj^
the knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which wa&stii|
plain and easy to be understood, as immediately todireejfclC
me to carry on the great work of sincere repentance fur flt$U
sift|* and laying hold ofa Saviour for eternal life, to i^¥$£*r
^jSaFstated reformation, and obedience to all God's insiite*
tions, without the assistance of a reverend and orthodox di-
vine; and especially by this same instruction, so to en-
lighten this savage creature, as to make him so good a
Christian, as very few could exceed him. And there was
only this great thing wanting, that 1 had no authority to ad-
minister the Holy Sacrament, that heavenly participation
of Christ's body and blood; yet however, we rested our-
selves content, that God would accept our desires, and ac-
cording to our faith, have mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made up in another,
and that was universal peace in our little church. We
had no disputes and wranglings about the nature and
equality of the holy, blesse4and undivided Trinity ; no
niceties in doctrine, or schemes of church government;
no sour or.morose dissenters to impose more sublimated
notions upon us; no pedant sophisters to confound us
"with unintelligible mysteries: but, instead of all this, we
enjoyed the most certain guide to Heaven; that is, the
word of God: besides which, we had the comfortable views
of his Spirit leading us to the truth, and making us both
willing and obedient to the instruction of his word. As
the knov\ ledge and practice of this are the principal means
of salvation. I cannot see what it avails any Christian
church, or man in the world, to amuse himself with spe-
culations, and opinions, except it be to display their par-
ticular vanity and affectation.
You may well suppose, that by the frequent discourse
we had together, my man and 1 became most intimately
acquainted, and that there was but very little that I could
say, but what Friday understood ; and indeed, he spoke ve-
ry fluently, though it was but broken English. I now
took a particular pleasure in relating all my adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being cast on this
island. I made him understand that wonderful mystery,
as he conceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to shoot. I also presented to him a knife, which pleas-
ed him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hang-
ing thereto, like those in which we wear hangers in En-
gland; and instead of a hanger to put in the frogV I gave
him a hatchet, which was not only as good, but even a
much better weapon upon many occasions. In a word*
my man thus accoutred, looked upon himself as great as
Don Quixotte, when that celebrated champion w&nj^to
combat the windmill.
 
I next gave him a very particular description of the ter-
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old En-
gland, the place of my nativity. I had laid before him the
manner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to ano-
ther, and how we trade in ships to every part of the uni-
verse. I then told him my misfortunes in being shipwreck-
ed, showing him, as near as I could, the place where the
ship lay, which had been gone long before; but I brought
him to the ruins of my boat, which before my whole
strength could not move, but now was almost rotten, and
fallen to pieces. I observed my man Friday to view this
boat with an uncommon curiosity; which, when he had
done, he stood pondering a great while, and said nothing.
At last, said I, Friday, what makes you ponder so much?
He replied, " O master, me see like boat come to place at
"my nation."'
It was some time, indeed, before I understood what my
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainly found,
that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon
the country where he dwelt; that is to say, by his farther
explanation, that the boat was driven there through stress
of weather; It then came into my mind that some Euro-
pean ship having been cast away, the poor distressed crea-
tures were forced to have recourse to the boat to save their
lives ; and being all, as I thought, drowned, I never con-
cerned myself to ask any thing concerning them, but my
only enquiry was about the boat, and what description my
man could give of it.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very well, making
every thing very plain to my understanding; but beyond
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great
warmth and ardour," O master we save white mans from
u drown ;"upon which I immediately asked him if there
were any white mans as he called them, in the boat t-
"Yes, yes," said he, "the boat full, very full of white
"mans," How many, Friday, said I. Hereupon he num-
bered his fingers, and counted seventeen. And when I
asked him what became of them all, and whether they
lived or not? he replied, Yes, master, they all live, they
be live among my nation. This information put fresh
thoughts into my head, that these must be those very
men who before I concluded had been swallowed up in the
ocean, after they had left the ship that had struck upon
Ijj^rocks of my kingdom, and after escaping the furv o?
 
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and committed
themselves lo the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which
consequently, as I thought, must be acted with greater
barbarity to strangers, created in me a greater anxiety,
and made me still more curious to ask Friday concerning
them. He told me he was sure they still lived there, hav-
ing resided among them above four years,, and that the
savages gave them victuals to live upon: but pray, Fri-
day, said I, whence proceeded all this good-nature and
generosity? How came it to pass that they did not kill
and eat them, to please their devouring appetites, and oc-
casion so splendid an entertainment among them ? u No,
tf no," said Friday, " they not kill 'cm, they make brothers
"with 'cm ;" by which I understood there was a truce be-
tween them. xVnd then I had a more favorable opinon of
the Indians, u,pon Friday uttering these words: " My na-
"tion, t'other nation no eat mans, but when mans make
"war fig4at as though he had said that neither those of
his kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of, ever
ate their fellow creatures, but such as their law of arms
allowed to be devoured ; that is, those miserable captives
"whose misfortune it should be to be made captives of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day
in most serene weather, my man and I stood upon the top
of a hill on the cast side of the island, w hence I had once
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday
fell a jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and
upon my demanding the reason of his behaviour, " O joy"
said he," Q glad, there see my country, there my nation,
li there live white mans gether." And indeed such a rap-
turous sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance, that
Lis eyes had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and
such a strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to
be in his country again. This made me not so well sa-
tisfied with my man Friday as before; for by this appear-
ance, I made no dispute but that if he could get back again
thither, he would not only be unmindful of what religion
I had taught him, but likewise of the great obligation
he owed me for his wonderful deliverance; nay, that
he would not only inform his countrymen of me, but ac-
company hundreds of them to my kingdom, and mak^
me a miserable sacrifice like those unhappy wr.-tcb^?
en in buttle.
 
Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel -
and unjust suspicions, and most freely own I wronged the
poor creature very much, who was of a quite contrary
temper. And had he had that discerning acuteness which
many Europeans have, he would certainly have perceived
my coldness and indiiTeren.ee, and also have been very-
much concerned upon that account: as I was now more
circumspect, I had much lessened my kindness and fami-
liarity with him, and while this jealousy continued, I used
that artful way (now too much in fashion, the occasion of
strife and dissention) of pumping him daily thereby to dis-
cover whether he was deceitful in his thoughts and incli-
nations; but certainly he had nothing in him but what
was consistent with the best principles, both as a religious
Christian and a grateful-friend; and, indeed, I found e*ve-
ry thing he said was ingenuous and innocent, that I had
no room for suspicion, and in spite of all uneasiness, he
not only made me entirely his own again, but also caus-
ed me much to lament that I ever conceived one ill
thought of him.
As we were walking up the same hill another day, when
the weather was so hazy at sea, that I could not perceive
the continent, Friday, said I, don't you wish yourself to be
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends
and acquaintances ? u Yes," said he, "me much O glad
<k to be at my own nation." And what would you do there>
Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and
be a savage as you were formely ( u No, no," (answered
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) " Friday now
u tell them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to
u eat corn bread, cattle flesh, milk, no eat man again.*"'
But surely, replied I, if you would offer to do all this, they
will kill you; and to manifest their contempt of such in-
struction eat you up when they have done. He then put
on a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying-,
u No, they no kill me, they willing love learn :5' that isv
that they would be very willing to learn : adding withal,
"that they had learned much of the bearded mans thai;
"came in the boat.'1 Will you, said I, go back again,
Friday I lie smiled at that, and told me, that he coukl not
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe for you.
"Yes, master," said he, " me go if you go, me no go if
"you stay/* I go, Friday 1 why would you have them to
eat me up, and devour your kind master? u No, no," saiil
he, " me make them hot eat master, and me make them
u much love you that is, he would tell them how I had
slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for which
reason he would make them love me; and then he related
to me, as well as he was able, how exceedingly kind those
of his nation were to the white, or bearded men, as ho
called them, who,in their great calamity, were driven into
their country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations
to venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to
join these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were
Spaniards or Portuguese; for, thought I, it must be cer-
tainly a better and safer way to escape when there is a good
company, than for me alone, from an island forty miles off
the'shore, and without any assistance. Some clays after,
Friday and I being at work, as usual, at the same time di-
verting ourselves with various discourses, I told him I had
a boat which I would bestow upon him, whenever he plea-
sed to return to his own nation; and to convince him of
the truth of what I said, I took him with me to the other
side of the island, where my frigate lay, and then taking
it from under the water (for I always kept it sunk for fear
of a discovery) we went both into it to see how it would
manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dextrous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again
as I could. Well now Friday, said 1, shall we now go to
your so much admired nation ? But instead of meeting with
iliat cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me-
lancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised
•me, till he made mc sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon
•which I let him understand I had a much bigger; and ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place where the first
boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had or
ixvt I could use failed me in my attempt to get it into the
water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty-
years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became
in a manner rotten* My man told me, that such a boat
v/ould do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry
enough -vittle, 'drink, bread, for that was his way of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my design of
going over with him to the Continent, I very plainly told
him, that we would both go and make a boat full as bk>
and more proportionable th.in that, wherein he might safe-
ly return to his own nation.
These words made Friday look so very pensive, that I
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was some
time before he could speak a word, winch made me ask
him, what was the matter with him? He replied in a ve-
ry soft and moving tone, u What has poor Friday done?
"why are you angry mad with poor servant? What me
"done, O what me done ?" Friday, said I, you never yet
have offended me, what makes you think I am angry with
you, when I am not angry at all. u You no angry, no
"angry," said he, several times; "if you be no angry*
"why den send Friday over great water to my own na-
"tion?" Why, surely, Friday, answered I, did not you
wish to be there, when from a mountain you beheld the
place where you was born? and is it not to satisfy your
desires that I am willing to give you leave to return thi-
ther? u Yes, yes," said Friday, u me wish to be there sure
"enough, but then me wish master there too : no wish Fri-
"day there, no master there." In short, he could not en-
dure the thoughts of going there without me. I go there i
Friday, sajd I, what shall 1 do there? He answered very
quickly, 4t O master, you do great deal much good, you
u teach all dc wild mans to be good tame mans: you learn
u dem to be sober, live good life, to know God, and pray
"God." Alas ! poor Friday, said I, what can I do against
their priests of Renamuckee, or indeed what good can 1
make your nation sensible of, when I myself am but a poor
ignorant man ?" No, no, master," said he," you be no ig-
A- norant, you tcachee me good, you teachee them good."
You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don't eare
to accompany you thither; I would rather live in this sol-
itude than venture among such inhuman savages. Go
your way, since you desire it, and leave me alone by my-
self, as I was before I saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck than TvU\
day was at these words. u Go me away, leave master:
u away," said he, after a long silence, u no, no, Friday dic.>
u Friday live not master gone," as though he had said, t
neither can nor will live^ if my master sends me from him,
And here I cannot but take notice of the strong ties of
friendship, which many times surpass those of consan-
guinity: For often we find a great disagreement amon^
kindred; and when there is any seeming regard far.^L
other, it is very seldom true, and scarce ever lasting, if
powerful interest does not bear the sway; and that alone
is often the occasion of the greatest hatred in the world,
which is to desire the death of parents and relations, for
the sake of acquiring their fortunes. But there was no
such thing between my servant and me; instead of which
there was the greatest gratitude and the most sincere love;
he found me not only his deliverer, but preserver and com-
forter; not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,
and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of susten-
ance ; and when he was ill or out of order, I was his phy-
sician, not only for his body but his soul; and therefore
no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, long
since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have
an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me,
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire
even to die, rather than live without me.
After 1 had told Friday, in a very earless manner, that
he should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was made,
the language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confu-
sion ; when, immediately running to one of his hatchets,
"which he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it
into my hand, with a heart so full, that he could scarcely
speak. Friday, said I, what is it you mean? What must
I do with this? u Only kill Friday," said he," Friday care
u not live long." But what must I kill you for? replied I
again. « Ah 1 dear master, what made you Friday save
u from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday,
u love God, and love not Bcnamuckee, and now Friday
cc send away; never see Friday more." As though the
poor creature had said, Alas! my dearest kind master,
"how comes it to pass, that after having ventured your pre-
cious life to save me from the jaws of devouring cannibals,
like myself, after such a tender regard to provide for me
such a comfortable nourishment, and continuing so long
a kind master, and a most sincere friend *, and after mak-
ing me forsake the false notion of an Indian deity, and
worship the true God in spirit and in truth ; and after all
ihis, how comes it now, that you are willing to send
me away to my former course of living; by which
means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other; but
greater must be my misfortune, that I shall never behold
Tnv best friend I have in the world any more. And this-
undoubtedly, though he could not express himself so clear*
Iy, must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down his
cheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I had mech ado
to refrain from weeping also, when I beheld the poor crea-
ture's affection; so that I was forced to comfort him in the
best manner I could, which I did, by telling him, if he was
content to abide with me, I should be ever willing to keep
him.
After Friday's grief was something abated, more fully
to convince me of his affection, he said, u O master, me
"not care to be in my nation, leave you here ; me desire
"nation learn good, that's all meaning, that his desire
was for the conversion of that barbarous people* But as
I had no apostolic mission, nor any concern about their
salvation ; so I had not the least intention or desire of un-
dertaking it; and the strength of my inclination, in order
to escape, proceeded chiefly from my late discourse with
Friday, about these seventeen white bearded men, that had
been driven upon the barbarian coast; whom I designed
to join as the only means to further our escape. To
which intent my man and I went to search for a proper
tree to fell, whereof we might make a large perigua or ca-
noe, to undertake the voyage; and, indeed, we were not
long in finding one fit for our purpose, there being enough
of wood in the island to have built a fleet of large vessels,
but the thing we principally wanted was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it after it was finished?
and not commit so horrid a mistake as I had done once
before.
Well, after a great search for what was best and most
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs
was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood
the most fitting for it. To this day I cannot tell the name
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by-
saying, that it is very like what we call fustic, or between
that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the sam«
colour and smell. But though my man exceeded meifi
the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him
a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever
he knew before j for he was for burning the hollow orca-
vity of the tree, in order to make this boat *t but I the>;
told him how he might do it with tools, learning him
the same time how to use them, which indeed he did very
dextrously: so that in a month's time we finished it, mak-
ing it very handsome, by cutting the outside in the *rue
shape of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight be-
fore we could get her into the water, which we did as it
were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but when she was
in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease
imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be sure at the
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less ama-
zed behold with what dexterity my man would manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said
I, what do you think of it now? Do you think this will
carry us over ?" Yes, master," said lie, u me venture
u over well, though great blow wind." But my design was
yet farther, which he was insensible of; and that was to
make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all
to procure: so that I fixed upon a straight young cedar-
tree, which I found near the place, great plenty of it
abounding in the island; and setting Friday to cut it down,
I gave him particular directions how to shape and order
it; but as to the sail, that I managed myself. I very well
knew I had some old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which
had lain six and twenty years by me; but not being care-
ful to preserve them, as thinking I should have no occa-
sion *o use them any more, when I came to overlook them
I found them almost all rotten, except two; and with these
I went to work, and after a great deal of pains and awk-
ward tedious stiching for want of needles, at length I fin-
ished a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in En-
gland a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom at bot-
tom, and a little sprit at the top, like those which our long-
boats use, and which I very well knew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which 1 had in my pa-
iron's fishing boat, when with my boy Xury, I made my
ecsape from the Barbarian shore.
It was near two months, I think, before I completed this
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my mast and sails:
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small
stay and 4 sail, or a foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to the westward ; and, what is still more, I fixed a
rudder 10 ti e stern of her, to steer with; and though I
was but d very indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensi-
ble of the gre*t usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing
like this, I applied myself to it wkh,such a constant upjvli*
cation, that at last 1 accomplished my design j but what
with the many dull contrivances I had about it, and the
failure of many things, it cost me as much pains in order-
ing as in making the boat. Besides, when all this was
done, I had my man to teach what belonged to its naviga-
tion; for though he very well understood how to paddle
a cannoe along, he was an utter stranger to a sail and a rud-
der, and was amazed when he saw me work the boat to
and again in the sea, by them, and how the sail gibed and
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed chang-
ed. After some time and a little use, I made all these
things very familiar to him, so that he became an expert
sailor, except in relation to the compass, and that I could
make him understand but little of. But, as it happened,
there was seldom occasion for it, there-being but little clou-
dy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts; the stars
were always visible in the night, and the shore perspicuous
by day, except in the rainy season, which confined every
one to his habitation. Thus entered in the seven and
twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which you please
(the last three of which, blessed with the company of my
man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the anniver-
sary of my landing here, with the same thankfulness to
God, for his tender mercies, as I did before; and certain-
ly, as I had great cause for a thankful acknowledgment for
my deliverance at first, I had much greater now for such
singular and additional testimonies of the care of Provi-
dence over me, in all my distress both of body and mind,
and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had a strong impression upon my mind,
that I should not be another year in this island. But, how-
ever I still continued on with my husbandry, digging",
planting, and fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obli-
ged me to keep the longer within^ors; but before this,
I brought my new vessel into the creek, where I had laiwjb.
ed my rafts from the ship, ancjjlturmg her up to the shores
I ordered my man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold;;
her in, and deep enough to give her water, wherein she
might float, and then when the tide was out, we Wide a *
strong dam across the end of it, to keep out the water, by *
which means she lay dry, as to the tide from tfe.*sea;
and to keep the rain lk>m her, we thatched hep over, as; k
were, with boughs oftrees> like a house? so we *wa3to$$
for the months of November and December, in which I
designed to venture over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw
near, but so much was I elevated with this new designed
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The
first thing I thought on was to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, in-
tending in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and
to launch out the boat for that purpose. But one morn-
ing as I was very busy upon something necessary for this
occasion, I called Friday to me, and bid him to go to the
sea shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a
thing which we commonly had once a week, as much on
account of the eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. Jle had
not been long gone but he came running back, as though
he was pursued for life, and as it were flew over my outer
wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or steps he
set his feet on; and before I hud time to enquire the rea-
son of his precipitation, he cries out, u O dear master, O
a sorrow, sorrow ! Bad 1 O bad!" Why what's the matter
Triday ? said I. "O yonder, yonder!" said he, "there
"be one, two or three canoes 1 two three 1" Surely thought
I, there must be six, by my man's way of reckoning;
hut on a strict enquiry, I found there were but three. Well
Friday, said I, don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not
only defend ourselves against them, but kill the most of
these cruel savages. But though I comforted him in the
best manner I could, the poor creature trembled so, that
I scarce knew what to dawitti him :—" O master, "said he,
"they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up."
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up as well as you,
and my danger is as great as yours. But since it is so,
we must resolve to fight for our lives. What say you?
Can you fight, Friday ?" Yes," said he, very faintly, u me
"me shoot, me kill what I can, hut there cornea great ma-
"ny number." That*s%l> matter, said I again, our guns will
terrify those that we doDO|J^ll; I am very willing to stand
by you to the last drop of Wy blood. Now tell me if you
will do the like by me, and obey my orders in whatsoever
I command? Friday then answered, " O master, me lose
life for you, me die when you bid die." Thus concluding
all questions concerning his fidelity, immediately I fetched
him a.good dram of rum, of which I-had been a very good
husband, and gave it him to comfort his heart, Arta;-h^
had drank It, I ordered him to take the two fowling-pieces
which we always carried, and load them with large swan-
shot as big as smali pistol bullets; then I took four mus-
kets, andloaded them with two slugs, and five small bul-
lets each; charging my two pistols each with a brace, I
hung my great sword, as customary, naked to my side,
and gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent weapon
of defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any
knight errant that ever handled a sword and spear. I took
my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill,
to see what I could discover; and I perceive^!,very soon,
by my glass, that there were one and twenty satages, three
prisoners and three canoes, and that their chiefconcern
seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor
human bodies, a thing which by this time I had observed
was very common with them. I also remarked that they
did not land at that place from whence Friday made his
escape, but nearer to the creek, where the shoie was low,
and where a thick wood came very close to the sea. My
sout was then filled with indignation and abhorrence at such
inhuman wretches, which put a period to all my former
thoughts in their vindication, neither would I give myself
time to consider their right of conquest, as I had done be-
fore; but descending from the mountain, I came down to
Friday, and told him, I was resolved to go speedily to them
and kill them all; asking him again, in the same breath,
if he would standby me : when by this time being recov-
ered from his fright, and his spirits much cheered with the
dram I had given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously
telling me, as he did before, " When I bid die, he would
"die."
And now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong
a manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its un-
common fury. I immediately dividefFthe loaded arms be-
twixt us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his
girdle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too
great, I confess, to bear; but what must a poor king do,
who had but one soldier in the world ? But to show I made
him bear no more than what 1 would lay on myself, I stuck
the other pistol in my girdle, and the other tYiree guns up-
on my shoulders ; nay something more, but that w'^sjike;
--Step's harden, a small bottle of rum, which ^ras spoi^W
lightened to our exceeding refreshment. Thus we m&rclk^
ed out, under a ponderous load of armour, like two invin-
cible champions, with a quantity of powder and bullets to
stand our battle, and load again, when the pieces were dis-
charged. And now my orders being to be obeyed, I charg-
ed Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot
or attempt any thing till I commanded him ; and in the
interim, not to speak as much as one word. It was in this
order I fetched a compass to the right hand, of near a
mile, as well to get over the creek, as to attain the wood;
and by this, I thought to come within shot of them before
I could be discerned, as I found by my glass, would not
be difficult to accomplish.
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even
in our greatest fury and strongest inclinations ? For while
I was taking this march, my resolution began to abate, not
through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked
unarmed wretches, but those reflections occured to my
thoughts : what power I was commissioned with or what
occasion or necessity had I to go and embrue my hands in
human blood, and murder people that had neither done nor
intended to do me any wrong? They were innocent in
particular as to me ; and their barbarous custom was not
only their misfortune but a sign that God had left them in
the most immense stupidity ;but yet did not warrant me
to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner
of his righteous judgments : That, on the contrary, when-
ever he thought fit, he would take vengeance on them him-
self, and punish them in a national way, according to their
national crimes; but this was nothing at all to me, who
had no concern with them. Indeed my man Friday might
justify himself, because they were his declared enemies,
of that very same nation that went to sacrifice him before;
and, indeed, it was lawful for him to attack them, which
I could not say was. so with respect to me.—So warmly
did these things pres&upon my thoughts all the way I
went that I only resolved to place myself so as to behold
their bloody entertainment, without falling upon them,
except something more than ordinary, by God*s special
direction, should oblige me thereto.
Tims fixed in my resolution,! entered into the thick wood
(my man Friday following me close behind) when with
all possible wariness and silence, 1 marched till I came to
^the skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to their?
;§|br only one end of the wood interposed between me rm^
them. Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, that was just at the corner of the
wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word,
if he could plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he
did as I commanded him, and came back with this melan-
choly story, that they were all about their fire, eating the
flesh of one of their prisoners ; and that another lay bound
upon the sand, at a little distance from them, which they
designed for the next sacrifice, and this he told me was not
one of their nation, but one of those very bearded men.who
were driven by a storm into their country, and of whom
he had so often talked to me about. You may be sure, that
upon hearing this, my soul was ready to sink within me;
when ascending into a tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a
white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his
hands and feet tied with flags, or things resembling rushes,
being covered with clothes, and seemed to be an European.
From the tree where I took this prospect, I perceived ano-
ther tree and a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer
to them than where I was, which by taking a small circle
round I might come at undiscovered, and then I should be
within half a shot of these devourers, And this consider-
ation alone to be more perfectly revenged upon them,
made me withhold my passion, though I was enraged to
the highest degree imaginable; when going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all
the way till I came to the other tree ; and then I ascended
to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards distance,
and there I had a full view of these creatures, and I could
perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear as obliged me not to lose a
moment's time. No less than nineteen of these dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, close huddled together, ex-
pressing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous an en-
tertainment; and they had just sent the other two to mur-
der this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by
limb to their fire ; for they were then just going to untie
the bands from his feet, in order for death,' as fetters- ate
knocked off the feet of malefactors before they ga tp tire
place of execution. Flereupon, immediately turningtp nijr
man, now, Friday, said 1, mind what I say,' fail in nothing,
but do exactly as you see me do. All which he pramis&ig
he would perform, I set down one of my muskets, and
fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the &am$;
by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him do the like: Are you ready ? said I:
"Yes, Master," said he; why then fire at them, said I
and that very moment I gave fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two, but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two, and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful conster-
nation, at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had
yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped up
on their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew
not which way to run or look; not knowing from whence
their destruction came. We threw down our pieces, and
took up others, giving a second dreadful volley ;but as
they were loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bul-
lets, we perceived only two of them fall; tho' many were
wounded, who run yelling and screaming about like mad
creatures. Now Friday, said I, lay down your piece, and
take up the musket, and follow me. He did so, with great
courage, when showing ourselves to the savages we gave
a great shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who
would have been sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged
the butchers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By
my order, Friday fired at them, at which shot I thought he
killed them all, by reason of their falling to the bottom of
the boat; however he killed two, and mortally wounded a
third. In the meantime, I cut the flags that tied the hands
and feet of the poor creature, and lifting him up, asked him
in the Portuguese tongue, What he was? He answered me
in Latin, Christianas; but so very weak and faint, that he
could scarce stand or speak. Immediately I gave him a
dram, and a piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him,
What countryman he was ? He said, His/ianiola, and then ut-
tered all the thankfulness imaginable for his deliverance.
Signior, said I, with as much Spanish as I was master of,
let us talk afterwards, but fight now : Here, take this sword
and pistol, and do what you can. And indeed, he did so
with such courage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them
to: pieces in an instant, the savages not having the power
to fly foriheir lives. 1 ordered Friday to run for those
pieces we left at the tree, which he brought with great
swiftness, and then I gave him my musket, while I load-
ed the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him \vilh
one of iheir wooden swords ; and though the former was
as brave as could be expected, haying twice wounded his
enemy in the head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian
had thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my
sword out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely
quitting, drew out his pistol, and shot him through the bo-
dy before I could come near him, tho' I was running to his
assistance. As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches
with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest were too
nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowling
pieces, wounded two, who running into the wood, Friday
pursued and killed; but the other, notwithstanding his
wounds, plunged himself into the sea, and swam to those
who were left in the canoe, which, with one wounded,
were all that escaped out of one and twenty. The account
is as follows:

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them;
and, indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape* lest
after the news had been carried to their people, they
should return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being re-
solved to pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes,
and bid Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than*
to my surprise, I found another poor creature,bound hand
and foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been,
with very little life in him. Immediately I unbound bin*,
and would have helped him up; but he could neither^1^4
nor speak, but groaned so piteously, as thinking he *wiiS
only unbound in order to be slain. Hereupon Ibid Fri<&§~:
speak to him, and tell him of his deUvei^i^%^:wheri pdilr
ing out my bottle, I made the poor \vr(&tch::^^:^4^axnt *
which* with the joyful news he had receiv^ s& ffctived
fcb teart, that he sat up in the boat. As straa asFi^p
 
began to hear him speak, and look more fully in his face-,
* H would have moved any one to tears, to perceive his un-
common transports of joy*; for he kissed, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, dan-
ced, simg, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his face
and head, then sung, then cried and jumped about again,
like a distracted creature; so that it was a great while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what
was the matter with him ; but when he came to the liberty
of his speech, at last he told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged pa-
rent, lie would sit down by him in the boat, open his
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish him: then he took his arms
and ancles, which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; by which means,
perceiving what the case was, I gave him some rum,
-which proved of great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the savages had got-
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur-
sue them: For there arose from the north-west,which con-
tinued ai| night long, such a violent storm, that I could not
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given
his father any bread ? He shook his head, and said," None,
"not one bit, me eat-a all up so I gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like-
wise gave him a dram for himself, and tv\ o or three bunch-
es of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to him,
for he would make him drink the dram to comfort him.
Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitch-
ed, with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out
uf sight as it were in an instant ; but at his return, I
perceived him slacken his pace, because he had some-
thing in his hand. And this I found to be, as he ap-
proached nearer, an earthen jug with some water for his
father, with two more cakes of bread, which he delivered
into my hands. Being very thirsty myself, I drank some
of the wateiS of which when his father had drank suffi-
ciently, ignore revived his spirits than all the rum I had
given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry th^
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was
posing himself on a green place, under the shade ofa tree?
but so weak, that though he exerted himself, he could not
stand upon his feet. Upon which 1 ordered Friday to rub
and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's*
But every minute he was employed in this, he would cast
a wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his father sit-
ing ; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning to-
him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease his
limbs, he returned back to me presently,and then I spoke
to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him to the
boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I
would take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along theshore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard too,
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs
to fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek al-
most as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over,
he took our new guests out of the boat; but so weak were
they, that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle, not being willing to make
an entrance into my wall, we made them a handsome tent
covered with old sails, and boughs of trees, making two-
good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and co-
ver them. Thus, like an absolute king over my subjects:
who owed their lives to me, I thought myself very consi-
derable, especially as I had now three religions in my:
kingdom, my man Friday being a Protestant, his father a
Pagan, and the Spaniard a Paptist: but I gave liberty of
conscience to all.
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat: which when he had done*
I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table> dined
withthem myself, and encouraged them. Friday was nif
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniardato%.
who spoke the language of the savages pretty welL
dinner I- ordered Friday to fetch home all ams #o?d tlie
ielcl of battle, and the next day to bury the dei^&adksj.
which he did accordingly.
And now tmade Friday inquire of his father Wh^ehhe
thought these savages had escaped the late sto&mVl&ffteSfr
L 3
canoe ? and if so, whether they would not return withf a
power too great for us to resist? He answered, that he
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm ; or/ if
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land
-where they would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody at-
tack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand
of man, but by two heavenly spirits (meaning Friday and
me)who were sent from above to destroy them. And
this, he said he knew, because he heard them say the
same to one another. And indeed he was in the right
on't; for I have since heard that these four men gave out
th%t whoever went to that inchanted island, would be de-
stroyed by fire from the Gods.
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap-
prehensions ceased : instead of which my former thoughts
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday's father as-
sured me i should have good usage in his nation. As to
the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more of his coun-
trymen and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made
their escape thither ; that though they were in union with
*he savages, yet they were very miserable for want of pro-
visions and other necessaries. When I asked him about
the particulars of his voyage, he answered that their ship
was bound from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havanna ; that
when the ship was lost, only live men perished in the
ocean ; the rest having saved themselves in the boat, were
now landed on the main continent. And what do they in-
tend to do there ? said L He replied, they have concerted
measures to escape, by building a vessel, but that they
had neither tools nor provisions, so that all their designs
came to nothing. Supposing, said I, I should make a pro-
posal, and invite them here, would they not carry me pri-
soner to new Spain ? he answered no ; for he knew them,
to be such honest men, as would scorn to act with such
inhuman baseness to their deliverer: That, if I pleased,
he and the old savage would go over to them, talk with
them about it, and bring me an answer: that they should
ail swear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the Holy Sa-
crament; and for his part he would not only do the. same,
but stand to the last drop of his blood, should there be
cask)1"].
These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but
when every tiling was ready, the Spaniard raised an ob-
jection that carried a great deal of weight with it: u You
"know, Sir," said he, "that having been some time with
"you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and
"corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for
"them, should they come over presently : much less to
"victual a vessel for an intended voyage. Want might
"be as great an occasion for them to disagree and rebel,
u as the children of Israel did against God himself, when
u they wanted bread in the wilderness. And, therefore,
"my advice is, to wait another harvest, and in the mean
"time cultivate and impro\e some more land, whereby
a we may have plenty of provisions, in order to execute
"our design."
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely;
and so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him
ever after. And thus we all four went to work upon some
more fnd, and against seed time we had gotten so much
cured and ti im med up,sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels
of barley, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all
the seed we had to spare. As we were four in number, and
by this time all in good health, we feared not an hundred
Indians, should they venture to attack us ; and while the
corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit to build
us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over ; which
being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them
down, appointing the Spaniard, who wTas now my privy
counsellor, to oversee and direct the work. I likewise in-
creased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild dams, and
bringing home their kids to my inciosure: Nor did i ne-
glect the grape season, but cured them as usual, though
I had such a quantity now, as would have filled eighty bar-
rels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they
in working, and I in providing for them, till harvest came,
God Ainiighty blessed the increase of it so much, that
from tv\enty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed out tw#
hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of ike, SttSi*
cient to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spaniards
to any part of America. ;,:
Thus the principal objection being answered, by a suffi-
cient stock of precisions, I sent my two ambassadors ovet*
the main laud, with a regal authority to administer the
 
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, tho' I never asked whether they
had pen, ink or paper; when giving each of them a mus-
ket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impa-
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning,
"when a strange accident happened, which was ushered in
by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud," Mas-
"tor, master, they are come, they are come." Upon which,
not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my bed,
put on my clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
and looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the
wind fair. I saw they did not come from the side where
the land lay on, but from the southermost end of the island:
So these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered
Friday to lie still, till such time as I came down from the
mountain, which, with my ladder, I now ascended, in or-
der to discover more fully what they were ; and now with
the assistance of my perspective glass, I plainly perceived
an English ship, which I concluded to be, by the fashion
of its long boat; and it filled me with such uncommon tran-
sports of joy, that I cannot tell how to describe j and yet
jTSgme secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I
.jfcpw not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon
';iiy guard. And indeed, I would have no man contemn
?Mie secret hints and intimations of danger, which very
Jbften are given, when he may imagine there is no' possi-
bility of its being real ; for had I not been warned by this
silent admonition, I had been in a worse situation than
befoie, and perhaps ineutably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach
the shore, js though they looked for a place where they
plight conveniently land ; unci at last they ran their boat
oil shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance;
;iHiich proved the happier for me, since, had they come in-
to the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my cattle, but plundered
sne of all I had in the world. Now I was fully convinced
they were all Englishmen, three of which were unarmed
and bound ; when immediately the first four or five leaped
on shore, and took those three out of the boat as prisoners
 
one of whom I could perceive used the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while the
others in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as-
tonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to as-
cend the mountain, and likewise view this sight. "O mas-
u tesaid he to me; u you see English mans eat prison--
"ers as well as savage mans." And do you think they
will eat them, Friday? said L " Yes," said Friday, « they
"eat-a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am much more
concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating them
up, that I am sure they will never do. .
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav-
ing the Spaniard and Savage with me, but also that I could
not come within shot of them unpereeived, they having
no fire arms among them, and save these three men, whom
I thought they were going to kill with their swords. But
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were set
at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the
place; and so long did they negligently ramble, that the
tide had ebbed so low, as to leave the boat aground. Nor
were the two men who were in her more circumspect j;_$ppf"
having drank a little too much liquor, they fell fa^tasiejlp;
but one of them waking before the other, antFpercelving*
the boat too fast aground for his strength to;hloy^ it, h .
hallooed out to the rest, who made all possible expetUti^ir^-
to come to him; but as Providence ordered it, all thefr
force was ineffectual to launch her, when I could heat*
them speak to one anotherv "^Vgjbljjfi&r alone, Jaek?
"can't ye; she'll float next U^H^SBB^^ word3 -1 -ws"
fully convinced they were my <^Kcouiitrymen.
while lay very quiet, as being fully sensible it could be tie*
less than ten hours before the boat would be afloat, and
then it would be so dark, that they could not easily per-
ceive me, by which means I should be at more ltbSi^f tc*!;
hear their talk, and observe all their motions: notbtit't&a^',
1 prepared for my defence : yet, as I had another soft-%£ •
enemy to combat with, I acted with more caution,;'I took.
two fusees on my shoulder, and gave Friday three musk
ets . besides my formidable goat-skin coat and monstrous
t'M ;iads .sie look-a* fi .yce and terrible as Hercules b£:oMj
'*ll.y syhen. t\\ o pistols were stuck in aiVytclt, and'.m^_
V^kc,\ ?vvt>rd hanging by my side*
 
 
 
 
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
was dark; and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor dis-
tressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were how-
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quar-
ter of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more
ado, I approached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, u What are ye, Gentlemen?"
At these words, they started up in great confusion, when
they beheld the strange figure I made ; they returned no
answer, but seemed as if they would fly from me: u Gen-
"tlemen," said I, in English, "don't be affraid, perhaps
"you have a friend nearer than you expect." "He must
"be from Heaven,*' said one of them, gravely pulling off
his hat, " for we are past all help in this world." "All
"help is from Heaven," replied I: "But Sir, as I have per-
"ceived every action between you and these brutes since
"your landing, only inform me how to assist you, and I
"will do it to the utmost of my power."
"Am I talking with God or man ?" said he, in melting
tears. "Are you of human kind, or an angel?" "Sir,"
said Ij " my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an
u Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant
"only: here are arms and ammunition : tell freely your
J- condition : Can we save you?" "The story," said he,
*' is too long to relate, since our butchers are so near: but
"Sir, I was master of that ship, my men have mutined,
"audit is a favor; thev l^ave put my mate, this passenger,
"and me, on sho^^tite: murdering us, though we ex-
*^je?^«i^hing but perishing here." "Are your enemies
"gone?" said I. u No," replied he, pointing to a thicket,
"there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest having seen
u and heard us, they should murder us all." u Have they
"fire arms?" said I. "They have but two pieces,"
said he, u one of which is left in the boat." He also told
me there were two enormous villains among them, that
were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed
or seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedi-
ence. "Well, well," said I, " let us retire farther under ,
"the covering of the woods and there it was I made y|
these conditions with him:!
 
 
A
I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority ; but should entire! v conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
their hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire,
I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun,
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon
them as they lay sleeping. The captain modestly said,
that he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other hand,
to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his mi-
sery, might be the ruin of us all. "Well," said he, " do
kJ as you think fitand so accordingly I fired, killed one of
the Captain's chief enemies and wounding the other, who
eagerly called for assistance ; but the Captain who had re-
served his piece, coming up to him, u Sirrah," said he,
"'tis too late to call for assitance, you should rather cry
"to God to pardon your villany and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun; three others were also
slightly wounded, who at my approach cried out for mer-
cy. This the Captain granted, upon condition that they
would swear to be true to him in recovering his ship,
which they solemnly did; however I obliged the Captain
to keep them bound. After which I sent Friday and the
Captain's mate to secure the boat and bring away the oar$
and sails; when, at their return, three men coming back,
and seeing their late distressed Captain, now their con-
queror, submitted to be bound also.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the
adventures of my whole life, which he heard with a serious
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and.
his two companions into my little fortified castle, showed
them all my conveniencies, and refreshed them with such
provisions as I could afford. When this was over, we be«^
gan to consider about regaining the ship; he said there
were, twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their litpi;
were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, were,
so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small
company to attack them. This was a reasonable iuferei&e
indeed; but something we must resolve on, and imme-
diately put in execution : we therefore heaved the boat up
on the beach so high, that she could not shoot off at felgh
water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to be: stopw
peel; so that all the signals they gave for the boat to come
on board were in vain. This obliged them to send another
boat on shore, with ten men armed, whose faces the Cap-
tain plainly descried, the Boatswain being the chief officer;
but observed there were three honest lads among them,
who were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave
him fresh courage (for I perceived he was in concern :)
in the mean time securing our prisoners, except two,
whom we took to our assistance, we thought ourselves able
to adventure a battle. When the sailors landed, and saw
their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired
for their companions to hear, yet received no answer. This
struck them with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if they would
return to the ship. I could perceive the Captain's counte-
nance change at this, till all of a sudden, three men were
ordered to look after the boat, while the remaining seven
leapt on shore in order to look for their companions; and
indeed they came to the brow of the hill near my ancient
castle, from whence they could see to a great distance in
the woods, and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under a spreading
tree. My opinion was that nothing could be done till night,
when I might use some artifice to get them all out of the
boat; but of a sudden they started up, and made to the
sea-side; hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's
mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could,
and so decoying them into the woods, come round to me
again. And this had a good effect ; for they followed the
noise, till coming westward to the creek, they called for
their boat to carry them over, and taking one of the men
out of her, left two to look after her, having fastened her
to a stump of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediate-
ly the Captain and our party passing the creek, out of their
view, we surprised them both, by the Captain's knocking
down one, and ordering the other to surrender on pain of
death, and who being the honestest of them all, sincerely
joined us.
By this time it was pretty late ; when the rest returning
to their boat, which they found aground in the creek, the
tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wringing their
bands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that they
should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men wauld
willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not agre#
hazard any of our party. But, to be more certain, Friday
and the Captain crawled upon their hands and feet, as near
as possible ; and when the boatswain approached in sight,
so eager was the Captain, tiiat he fired and killed him on
the spot ; Friday wounded the next man, and a third ran *
away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army ; and,
it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in the
boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with them.
Accordingly he called out aloud, "Tom Smith, Tom
"Smith I" He answered,u Who's that ?"" Robinson !" an-
3 swercd the other. "For God's sake Tom, surrender im-
"mediately, or you're all dead men." tc Who must we
£c surrender to ?" says Smith. "To our Captain and fifty
"men here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will
"Fryc, and killed the boatswain." ** Shall we have quar-
cc tcrs then?" said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out,
"You Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately,
"and you shall all have your Ihes granted, except Will
u Atkins." Hereupon, Atkins cries out, u What have I
"done Captain, more than the rest, who have been as bad
"as me?" But that was a lye, for he was the person that
laid hold of him, and bound him. However, he was or-
dered to submit to the governor's mercy, for such was I
called. And so, laying down their arms, wc bound them
all, and seized on their boat.
After which the Captain expostulated with them, telling
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might
execute them there ; but he thought they would be semvto
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered Uj prepare
for death next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they
might not be sent to England. This answered ^trrjjrojcct
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins dEro^voijf
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being eoi*|*
mitted to my power, I sent the Captain to treat with tfa&iri
in the governor's namcoflering them pardon if they \v$uld
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all prc£*.
miseel to stand by him till the last drop of their biood*^},\-
ivhocver acted treacherously, should be hanged iiT c^^:
ypon the beach. They were all released on th^^.^ss^f ,.
ances;and then the Captain repaired to the olheT»;SS&v>
making his passenger captain of her, and gave him fo^j
metj weil armed; wnile himself, mate, and five more, went.'^
in the qther boat. By midnight they came witMn call oF
  M
 
the ship, when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her,
and tell them that with great difficulty they found the men
at last. But while they were discoursing, the Captain, mate,
and the rest entered, and knocked down the second mate
and carpenter, secured those that were upon the deck, by
putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and secured the forcastle ; they then broke into the
round-house, where the mate, after some resistance, shot
the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the
rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship be-
ing recovered, the joyful signal was fired, which I heard
with the greatest joy imaginable : nor was it long before
he brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth,
where coming to me unawares, " There," says he, "my
"dearest friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we
are your servants :'1 a comfort so unspeakable, as made
me swoon in his arms, while, with gratitude to Heaven,
we were tenderly embracing each other.
Nothing now remaining, but to consult what we should
do withnhe prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending for them,
*old them, that I was going to leave the island with all my
people, if they would tarry there, there lives should be spa-
red ; if not, they should be hanged at the first port they
came at. They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them
my whole story, charging them to be kind to the Spaniards
that were expected, gave them all my arms, and inform-,
ing them of every thing necessary for their subsistance, I
and my man Friday went on board. But the next mor-
ning two of the men came swimming to the ship's side, de-
siring the Captain to take them on board, though he hang-
ed them afterwards, complaining mightily how barbarous-
ly the others used them. Upon which I prevailed with
the Captain to take them in ; and being severely whipt and
pickled, they proved more honest for the future. And
so I bid farewel to this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting
buL' December 12, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two
months, and nineteen days residence, that same day
and month that I escaped from Sallee, landing in England
June 11, 168T, after five and thirty yeaixs absence from
'tny own country, which rendered me altogether a stn\?>-
gcr Lb ere
- Here I found my first Captain's widow alive, who had
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances,
and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after I
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family were ex-
pired, except two sisters, and as many of one of my bro-
ther's children. I found no provision had been made for
me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that
I was but in a very slender station. Indeed the Captain
did me a great kindness, by his report to the owners,
how I had delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, up-
on which they made me a present of 2001. sterling. I
next went to Lisbon, taking my man Friday with me, and
there arriving in April, I met the Portuguese Captain,
wiio had taken me on board on the African coast; but,
being ancient, he had left off the sea, and resigned all his
business to his son, who followed the Brazil trade. So
altered both of us were, that we did not know each other
at first, till I discovered myself more fully to him. After
a few embraces, I began to enquire of my concerns; and
then the old gentleman told me, that it was nine years since
he had been at Brazil, where my partner was then living,
but my trustees were both dead; that he believed I should *
have a good account of the product of my plantation; that,
the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my trustee*
to give an estimate of my share *o the procurator fiscal,
who, in case of my not returning, had given one third ia
the king and the rest to the monastery of St. Augustine:
but if I put in my claim, or any one for me, it would be
returned, except the yearly product which was given to
the poor. I then desired them to tell me what improve-
ment he thought had been made of my plantation, and
whether he imagined it was worth my while to look after
it? he answered, he did not know how much it was im-
proved ; but this he was certain of, that my partner, was..
grown vastly rich upon half of it; and, that he hadbsen
informed, that the king had 200 moidores per annu^for
his third part. He added, that the survivors of my trus>
tees were persons of an ingenuous character; that my part-
ner could witness ray title, my name being registered ill
the country, by which means I should indispensably recov-
er considerable sums of money. But, answered I, how
could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made yoii
Wf heir? This, said he, was true; but, there beisj
^^^avit made of my death, he could not a^:t as niy.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
executor. However, he had ordered his son (then at
Brazil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he
had taken possession of my sugar-house, having account-
ed himself tor eight years with my partner and trustees
for the profits, of which he would give me a very good
account.
And indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few
days, making himself indebted to me 470 moidorcs of gold,
over and above what had been lost at sea, after I left the
place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes he
had gone through, which forced my money out of his hands
to buy part in a new ship: "But," says he, 4< you shall
is> not want, take this; and, when my son returns, every
"farthing shall be paid you." Upon which he put into
my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as likewise the
instrument, containing the title to the ship which his son
%vas in, and which he offered as security for the remainder.
But really when I saw so much goodness, generosity, ten-
derness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept it,
for fear he should straiten himself upon my account. "It
"is true," said he, " it may be so; but then the money
*k is yours, not mine, and you may have the greatest oc-
"casion for it." However I returned fifty of them back
agc-um promising that I would freely forgive him the other
hundred when I got my*effects into my hands, and that I
designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter
my name with a notary public, as likewise my affidavit,
 vyiih a procuration affixed lo it; and this he ordered me to
r"5ci»d in a letter to one of Ins acquaintance, a merchant in
Brazil; and indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and
honorably obscivcd ; for in seven months time, I had a
very faithful account of all my effects, what sums of mo-
ney -were raised, what expended, and what remained for
fpy use: In a word, I found myself to be worth 50001.
sterling-, and a 1000 per annum. Nor was this all; for
my partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling
me how much my plantation was improved, what Negroes
were at work, and how many Jive Marian he had said to
the Virgin Mary for my preservation, desiring me to ac-
cept kindly some presents he had sent me, which I found
showed the greatest generosity. * * -
No sooner did the s'.ip arrive, but I rewarded my faith-
ful Capuum by returning him the hundred moidoresr*#[i:
not only forgiving him all he owed me, I allowed him
yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their
lives. And now being resolved to go to England, I return-
ed letters of thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in
particular to my old partner, with very suitable presents.
By the Captain's advice, I was persuaded to go by land to
Calais, and there take passage for England ; when, as it
happened, I got a young English gentleman, a merchant's
son at Lisbon, to accompany me, together with two En-
glish, and two Portuguese gentlemen; so that with a Por-
tuguese servant, an English sailor, and my man Friday,
there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to
Madrid, when the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas-
singly reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so that
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna,
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Ton*
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us.
together with their servants, wc had a very jolly company
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains and through
so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly
passed them., which, as wc travelled along, ushered us in-
to the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces o:
Languedoc and Gascogoine.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co-
mical. First, our guide was encountered by three wolves
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded
him in three places; upon which my man riding up to
his assistance, shot one of them upon the spot, which
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasant-
"cst adventure was to behold my man attack the bsa?*. JTis
such a creature, that if you let him alone, he never will
meddle with you; and this my man very well knew, and
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, u he
u would make good laugh." " Why you silly fool,'* said I?
"he'll eat you up at a mouthful." "Eatee me up,*5 re*
plied he by way of scorn, u me not only eatee him, hm
"make much good laugh.1' Upon which pulling oiTHs
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the xnon-
sir*, us beast, he called out that he wanted to discourse with
^4iLr>, and then throwing stones on purpose to incense hijn,
tifeJ?east turns about in fury, and with prodigious stri|&|J,
sfeiles after him. But though he was not swift enoJS^
 
to keep pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were
for help; yet being angry, " You dog," said I, " immedi-
"ately take horse and let us shoot the creature." But he
cried, "Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh
"much." And so he turned about, making signs to follow,
while the bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he
ascended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of
it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it, but ascended
like a cat, though his weight was very great. You must
consider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my man,
as not perceiving any thing to occasion laughter, till such
time as we rode up nearer, and beheld the beast mounted
upon the oak, on the beginning of the same branch, to
which Friday clung at the farther end, where the bear
durst not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, " Now mas-
<4 ter, me make much laugh, me make bear dance." Upon
which he fell a shaking the bough, which made the crea-
ture look behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then
as if the bear had understood his stammering English;
u Why you no come farther, Mr. Bear ?" said he, " pray
<( Jvlr. Bear come further and then indeed we all burst in-
to laughter, especially when we perceived Friday drop like
a squirrel upon the ground, leaving the beast to make the
best of his way down the tree. And now thinking it the
most convenient time to shoot the creature, Friday cried
out, " O ! dear master no shoot, me shoot by and by;"
when taking up the gun, u me no shoot yet," said he, u me
*{ make one more much laugh." And accordingly he was as
good as his word; for the creatine descending backwards
from the tree very liesurely, before he could lay one foot
on the ground, Friday shot him through the car, stone
dead; and looking to see whether we were pleased, he
burst out into a hearty laughier, saying, u So we kill de
"bear in my country, not with do gun, but with much long
i6 arrows." Thus ended our diversion, to our great satis-
faction ; especially in a place where the terrible bowlings
struck us with a continual tcjror. But the snows now
growing very deep, paiticularly on the mountains, the rav-
enous creatures were then obliged to seek for sustenance
in the villages, were coming by surprise on the country
peoplerkilled several of them, besides a great number of
their sheep and horses. *' iry
; Our guide told us, that we had yet one more dangerofc*
place to pass by; and if" there were any more wolves |i>
the country, there we should find them. This was a small
plain, encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane
to the village where we was to lodge. When we entered
the wood, the sun was within half an hour of betting; and
a little after it was set, we came into the plain, which
was not above two furlongs over, and then we perceived
five great wolves cross the road, without taking notice of
us, and so swift as though they were pursuing after their
prey. Hereupon our guide, believing there were more
coming, desired us to be upon our guard. Accordingly,
our eyes were very circumspect, till about half a league
further, we perceived a dead horse* and about a dozen of
wolves devouring its carcase. My man Friday would fain
have fired at them, but 1 would not permit him ; nqr had
we gone half over the plain, but we heard dreadful howl-
ings in a wosd on our left, when presently we saw an hun-
dred come ujv against us, as tho' they had been an ex-
perienced army. This obliged us to form ourselves in the
best manner; and then I ordered that every other man
should fire, that those who did not, might be ready to give
a second volley, should they advance upon us ; and then
every man should make use of his pistols. But there was
no necessity for this; for the enemy being terrified, stop-
ped at the noise of the fire; four of them were shot dead,
and several others being wounded, went bleeding away, as
we could very plainly discover by the snow. And now re-
membering what had been often u Id me, that such was the
majesty of a man's voice, as to strike terror even in the
fiercest creatures, I ordered all our companions to halloo
as loud as possible; and in this notion I was not altogether
mistaken; for they immediately turned about upon the
first halloo, and began to retire, upon which, ordering a se-
cond volley in their rear, they galloped into the woods with
great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again,
and then made all the haste we could on our way; but we
had not rode far, before we weie obliged to put ourselves
in a posture of defence as before, being alarmed with a tfe-
vy dreadful noise in the same wood, on our left hai>d, the
same way as we were.to pass, only that it was at so^^' dis*
tance from us. By this time the darksome clouds
spread over the elements, and the night growing very
kyi made it so much the more to our disadvantage.; but sufl-
increasing, we were fully assured, .that it was the
howling and yelling of those ravenous creatures; when
presently three troops of wolves on our front, appeared in
sight, as though a great number of them had a design to
surround us, and devour us in spite of fate. But as they did
not fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on our jour-
ney in as swift a manner as the roads would permit our
horses, which was only a large trot. It was in this manner
we travelled, till such time as we discovered another
wood, and had the prospect of its entrance through which
we were to pass, at the farthest side of the plain. But sure-
ly none can express the terror we were in, when approach-
ing the lane, we perceived a confused number of the fier-
cest wolves, standing, as it were, guarding its entrance.
Nor were we long in this amazement, before another oc-
casion of horror presented itself; for suddenly we heard
the report of a gun at another opening in the wood, and
looking that way, out ran a horse bridled and saddled, fly-
ing with the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen or
seventeen wolves pursuing him, in order to devour the
poor creature; and unquestionably they did so, after they
had run him down, not being able to hold out that swift-
ness with which he at first escaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence the
horse came, there lay the carcases of another horse and
two men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves, and
undoubtedly one of these men was the person who fired
the gun which we heard, for the piece lay by him; but,
alas 1 most of the upper part of his body and head were en-
tombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we
could not tell; but it was not long before the wolves made
us to come to a resolution ; for such numbers surrounded
us, every one of whom expected their prey, thai were our
bodicb to be divided among them, there would not be half
a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it was for us,
that but a little way from the entrance, there lay some ve-
ry Lrge timber trees, which I supposed had been cut down
and hid there for sale; amongst which I drew my little
troop, placing ourselves in a line behind a long tree, which
served us for a breast work, when desiring them to alight,
>ve siood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing our bodies
in the centre,the only place where we could preserve them,
Never certainly was there a more furious charge than
•what the wolves made upon us in this place; and the sight
of the horses, which was the principle prey they aimed at3
provoked their hunger, and added to their natural fierce-
ness* They came on us with most a dreadful noise, that
made the woods ring again ; and beginning to mount the
pieces of timber, I ordered every man to fire, as before di-
rected : and indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they
kiiled several of the wolves at the first volley; but still we
were obliged to keep a continual firing,by reason they came
on like devils, pushing one another with the greatest fu-
ry. But our second volley something abated their courage,
"when stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the
best of their way; however it did not prove so, for others
made a new attempt upon us; and though in four firings
>ve killed seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as
rnany, yet they several times successively came on, as
though they valued not their lives for the sake of their prey.
Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too suddenly,
and therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a
horn of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the
timber, which he did while Friday was charging my fu-
see and his own with the greatest dexterity. By this lime
the wolves coming up the timber, I set fire to the train,
by snapping a discharged pistol close to the powder.
This so schorche'd and terrified them, that some fell down,
and others jumped in amongst us; but these were im-
mediately dispatched, when all the rest, frightened with
the light, which the darksome night caused to appeal*
more dreadful, be^an at length to retire; upon which,
ordering our last pistols to be fired at once, giving at the
same time a gre »t .shout, the wolves were obliged to have
recourse to their swiftness, and turn tail; and then we
sallied out upon twenty lame ones* cutting them in pieces
with our swords, which obliged them to howl lamentably,
to the terror of their fellows, who resigned to us the field
as victorious conquerors. And indeed I question whether
Alexander, king of Macedonia, in any of his conquests,
had more occasion for triumph than we had; for he was
but attacked with numerous armies of soldiers; whereas
our army was obliged to combat a legion of devils, as it
were, worse than the cannibals, who, the same moment
the^- had slain us, would have sacrificed us to satisfy their
voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having
killed threescore of them, and saved our lives from their/
fury. We had still a league farther to go, when, as we
went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome
howlings, and we expected every moment another attack.
But, in an hours time, we arrived at the town where we
were to lodge ; and here we found the place strictly
guarded, and all in terrible confusion, as well they might,
for fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the village,
in order to prey upon their cattle and people. The next
morning we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason
the other fell very bad of his wounds, which he had re-
ceived, as before mentioned. After we had reached Tou-
louse, we came into a warm, pleasant and fruitful country,
not infested with wolves, nor any other sort of ravenous
creatues; and when we told our story there, they much
blamed our guide, for conducting us through the forrest at
the foot of the mountains, in such a severe season, when
the snow obliged the wolves to seek for shelter in the
"woods. When we informed them in what manner we
placed ourselves, and the horses in the centre, they ex-
ceedingly reprehended us, and told us, that it was an hun-
dred to one, but we had all been destroyed; for that it
was the very sight of the horses, their so much desired
prey, that made the wolves more ragingly fierce than they
would have been, whicn was evident, by their being at
other times really afraid of a gun; but then being exceed-
ingly hungry, and furious upon that account, their eager-
ness to come at the horses made them insensible of their
danger; and that, if we had not, by a continual fire, and
at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of powder,
got the better of them, it had been great odds if their
number had not over powered us; besides, it was a great
mercy that we alighted, from our horses, and fought them
with that courage and conduct, which had we failed to do,
every man of us, with our beasts, had been destroyed; and
indeed, this was nothing but truth: for never in my life,
was I so sincerely sensible of danger, as when three hun-
dred devils came roaring upon us, to shun whose unwel-
come company, if I was sure to meet a storm every week,
I would rather go a thousand leagues by sea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage thro'
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater
s learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account
•^kanmy pen is able to furnish. From Toulouse I travel-
led to Paris, from thence to Calais; where I took shipp&g*
and landed a*t Dover, the 14th of January, in a very cold
season.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered
my new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had
were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy counsellor, thought no pains nor care too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor had I ever occasion to blame
her fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was
for leaving rny-effects in her hands, intending to set out for
Lisbon, and so to the Brazils; but as in the Desolate island
I had some doubts about the Romish religion, so I knew
there was little encouragement to settle there, unless I
apostatized from the orthodox faith, or lived in continual
fear of the inquisition. Upon this account I resolved to
sell my plantation; and for that intent, I wrote to my old
friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great
satisfaction ; which was, that he could sell it to good ac-
count; however, if I thought it convenient to give him li-
berty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sur-
vivors of my trustees, residing at the Brazils, who conse-
quently knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the
spot, and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore
might be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in
the least doubt, but that I should make four or five thou-
sand pieces of eight more of it, than I could, if I disposed
of it in any other manner whatsoever.
You may be sure I could not but agree with this kind
and ingenuous proposal ; and immediately I sent him an
order to offer it to them, which he accordingly did; so that
about eight months after, the ship being in that time re-
turned, he gave me a satisfactory account, that they not
only willingly accepted the offer, but they had also remitted
33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of their own, a|
Lisbon, in order to pay for the purchase. 4
Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, ac-.
cording to form, which they had sent from Lisbon, arid
returned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, for.
my estate, bills of three hundred and twenty-eight thousand
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred
moidorcsper annum, which I had allowed him duri% life^
likewise fifty to his son during life also, accordingX&'&kf
promise, which the plantation was to make good #;§|i||$;

And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of the
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculi-
ar providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of un-
certainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity,
beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; methinks,
now that I am come to a safe and pleasant haven, it is
time to cast out my anclior, and, laying up my vessel, bid
for a while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other
concerns to look after, but the care of my brother's two
sons, which, with the good widow's persuations, obliged
me to continue at home seven years. One of these chil-
dren I bred up a gentleman, and the other an experienced
sailor, remarkable for his courage and bravery. Besides
this, I married a virtuous young gentlewoman, of a very
good family, by whom I had two sons and one daughter.
But my dear and tender wife leaving this earthly stage (as
in the second part of my life you will hear) which rent my
soul as it were asunder, my native country became weary
and tiresome to me, and my nephew happening to come
fbom sea, tempted me to venture another voyage to the
East Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at which time
I visited my island, and informed myself of every thing
that happened since my departure.
One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffer-
ed, together with an advanced age, and the fear of losing,
not only what I had gotten, but my life also, might have
choaked up all the seeds of youthful ambition and curiosity,
and put a lasting period to all my wandering inclinations.
But as nothing but death can fully allay the active part of
my life, no less remarkable for the many various contingen-
cies of it, you will next perceive how I visited my litte king-
dom, saw my successors the Spaniards, had an account of
the usage they met with from the Englishmen, agreeing
and disagreeing,uniting and separating,till at last they were
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very honor-
ably, together with the wonderful and successful battles
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their invincible
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid
twenty days, left tltem supplies of all necessary things, as
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts,
reserving the whole property1 to myself. Nor will you be
insensible, by the account of these things, of several new-
adventures I have been engaged in, the battles I have
fought, the deliverances I have met with : and while, in
the surprising relation of such remarkable occurrences, I
shall describe many of God's kindest providences to me
in particular, no less conspicuous in the same goodness,
power and majesty of our great Creator, shown one way
or other, over the face of the earth, if duly adverted to.
FURTHER ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
WHEREIN ARE CONTAINED SEVERAL STRANGE AND
SURPRISING ACCOUNTS OF HIS TRAVELS,
AND HIS MOST REMARKABLE fRAN S ACTIONS BOTH BT
SEA AND LAND.
WHEN we consider the puissant force of Nature, and
what mighty influence it has many times over the temper,
of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to think, that
my powerful reason should be overcome by a much
stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran conti-
nually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in
the night: nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk,
even to impertinence, when I was awake. I had such va~
pours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my
castle; that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old;
Spaniard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked and dis-.
coursed with them about their manner of living ; that I
heard the things related to me, which I found afterwards
to be too true ; and that I executed my judgments with the
greatest severity upon the offenders. And indeed, this an-
ticipating all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afford-"
cd trie one pleasant hour: my dear and tender wife Could
not but take notice of it, which drew these affectionate
speeches from her: "My dear/' said she,t; I am really
44 persuaded that some secret impulse from Heaven occa^
"sions in you a determination to see the island again : nor
"am I less sensible, but your being engaged to me m4
"these clear children, is the only hinderance of your dep«r>
"ture. I know, my dear, if I were in the grave, you would
"not long continue at home ; prevent not your happiue&Sr'
"on my account, whose only comfort centres in you. Alt
"that I can object is, that such an hazardous undertaking
<4 is no way consistent with a person of your years ; but if
"you are resolved to go,,v|dded she, weeping,u only per-
^ mit me to bear you company, and that is all I desire***
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno-
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensi-
bly into my right understanding; and when I considered
all the transactions of my life, and particularly my new en-
gagement ; that I had now one child already born, and my
wife big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek
for more riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency,
with much struggling I altered my resolutions at last, re-
solving to apply myself to some business or other, which
might put a period to such wandering inclinations. Here-
upon I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, with
a resolution to move thither ; upon this there was a pretty
convenient house, surrounded with land, very capable of
improvement, which suited my temper, as to planting,
managing, and cultivating. Nor was I long before I en-
tered upon my new settlement, having bought ploughs,
harrows, carts, waggons, horses, cows, and sheep ; so that
1 now led the life of a country gentleman, and as happy
in my retirement as the greatest monarch in the world.
And what made me think my happiness the greater was,
that I was in the middle state of life, which my father so
often recommended, much resembling the felicity of a ru-
ral retirement, which is elegantly described by the poet
in these lines:
Free from all vie es, free from care,
Age has no fiain, and ijouth no snare.
But in the midst of this my happiness, I was suddenly
plunged in the greatest sorrow that I could possibly en-
dure ; for when I least expected it, my clear and tender wife
was forced to submit to the irresistible power of Death,
leaving this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for
me to express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of
her person ; neither can I too much lament her loss, which
my latest breath shall record; her influence was greater
over me than the powers of my own reason, the importuni-
ties of friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting
tears of a tender and disconsolate mother; in a word, she
was the spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of my enter-
prizes. But now, since the cruel hand of Death had closed
my dearest's eyes,I seemed in my thoughts a stanger to the
world ; my privy counsellor being gone, I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind. And
when I looked around me in this busy world? one part h*
bouring for bread, and the other squandering away their
estates'; this put me in mind how I had lived in my little
kingdom, where both reason and religion dictated to me%
that there was sqmething that certainly was the reason and
end of life, which was far superior to what could be hoped
for on'this side the grave. My country delights were now
as insipid and dull, as music and science to those who have
neither taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave
off house-keeping, I left my farm, and in a few months re-
turned to London.
But neither could that great city, so famous for its va-.
ricty of entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight;
a state of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and
most hurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning
of the year 1684, at which time my nephew (who, as I
before observed had been brought up to the sea, and ad*
vanced to be Captain of a ship) was returned from a short
voyage to Bilboa, the first he had made in that station.
He comes to me one morning, telling me that some mer-
chants of his acquaintance had persuaded him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and China, in the
manner of private traders; "and now, uncle," said he,
u if you'll accompany me thither, 1*11 engage to land you
u upon your old island, to yisit the stale of your little
4* kingdom."
Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get
a patent for its possession, and then to fill it with inhabi-
tants. After I had paused a while, and looked stedfastly
on him, a What Devil, or spirit/' said I, u sent you with:
*4 this unlucky errand r" He started at first; but recovering
himself when he perceived I was not offended: u Sir,5* re-
plied he, what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled
unlucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see your
little territory, where you reigned with more content thai*
any of your brother kings in the universe.—" Nephew/"
said I, " if you will leave me'there, and call for me as you
come back, I care not if I give my consent: but he an-
swered, that the merchants would not allow their vessel*,
loaded with an infinite value, to return there again, which
was a month's sail out of the way ; w besides, Sir," s.aici
he, " if I should miscarry, was your request granted, why
cs then you would be locked up as before/* This, indeed?,
carried a great deal of reason in it; but we found out a re-
suedy, acd that was to^arry a framed sloop ©u boards rsa^
dy to be set up in the island, by the assistance of some
carpenters winch we should carry with us, that might be
f» ed in a few days to go to sea. I was not long in form-
ing my resolution, which overswayed my good friend the
widow's persuasions, and the natural affection I bore to
my young children. I made my will, and settled my es-
tate in such manner, that I was perfectly sure my poor in-
fants would have justice done them. The good widow not
only undertook to make provision for my voyage, but also
took the charge of my domestic affairs, and to provide for
my children's education; and indeed no mother could take
more care, or understood that office better: for which I
lived to reward and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being
ready to sail, I and Friday went'on board in the Downs on
the 8th, having, besides that sloop already mentioned, a
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had
some servants, whom I proposed to leave there, as they
should appear willing; there were two carpenters, a smith
and a very ingenious fellow, who was Jack-of-all-trades;
for he was not only a cooper by trade, but also he was dex-
trous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, like-
wise a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I also carried
a tailor, who consented to stay on my plantation, and pro-
ved a most necessary fellow hi the island. As to my car-
go, it consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and En-
glish stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to
find there; as likewise gloves, hats, shoes and stockings;
together with beds, bedding, and household stuffs, especial-
ly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles", pewter, brass, S:c.
also nails, tools of all sorts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all
other things necessary ; all which I think, cost me about
three hundred pounds. Nor was this all: for 1 carried an
hundred spare arms, muskets and fusees, besides some
pistols, a considerable quantity of several sorts of shot, two
brass cannon, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part
of some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew take with
us two small quarter-deck guns, more than he had occa-
sion for in his ship, to leave behind, if there was a neces-
sity; so that we might build a fort there, and man it against
all opposers whatsoever.
Well, we put to sea ; and though I can't say this voy-
age was so unprosperous as my others had been, yet con-
trary winds drove us so far northward, that we were obiL-
ged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two and twenty days. Here indeed our provisions
were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores, by-
taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which I then
resolved to put on shore in my island, if our necessities
did not call for them. On the 5th of February, we sailed
* from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some
days; and I think it was about the 20th of the same month
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired: and when he
was speaking, a boy came in, and told us that the boat-
swain had heard another. Upon which we all ran to the
quarter-deck, from whence, in a few moments, we per-
ceived a terrible fire at a distance. We had immediately
recourse to our reckonings, in which,wc were all of opinion
that there could be no land that way, it appearing to be at
N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded that some ship had
taken fire at sea, and that it could not be far off, by the re-
port of the guns which we had heard. We made up di-
rectly to it, and in half an hour's time, the wind being fair,
we could plainly percehe a great ship on fire in the middle
of the ocean. Touched with this unhappy disaster, and
considering my former circumstances, when the Portu-
guese captain took me up, I ordered immediately five guns
to be fired, that the poor creatures, not seeing us, it being
dark (though we could perceive their flame) might be
sensible there was deliverance at hand, and consequently
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat. Nor
was jt long before the ship blew up in the air, and the fire
was extinguished in the ocean. But supposing them all to
be in their boats, we hung out our lanterns, and kept firing
till eight o'clock in the morning; when, with our perspec-
tives, we beheld two boats full of people, making'towards
us, tho' the tide was against them; then spreading out
our ancient, and hanging out a waft, as a signal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time we came up to
them, and took them all in, there being no less than sixty-
four men, women, and children. It was a French mer-
chant ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bound from
Quebec in the river of Canada. The master informed me
how, by the negligence of the steersman, the steerage
was set on fire : that at his outcry for help, the fire was,
as we thought totally extinguished: but that some sparks
getting between the timber, and within the ceiling, it pro-
ceeded into the hold, where there was no resisting it; and
then they got into their boats, as creatures in the last ex-
tremity, with what provision they had, together with oars,
sails- and a compass, intending to go back to Newfound-
land, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though there
were several chances against them, as storms to overset
and founder them, rains and colds to benjimb and perish
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and
starve them; but, said he, in this our great distress, we
heard the welcome report of your guns, when with un-
speakable joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were
resolved to lie by till morning; but perceiving your light,
we set our ours to work, to keep our boat a-head, the soon-
er to attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deli-
verance.
Indeed no one can express "the joy of these poor crea-
tures on this occasion; fear and grief are easily s»t forth;
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head,
are all the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess
of joy carries in it a thousand extravagancies especially,
I think, among the bYench, whose temper is allowed to be
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay than that of
otj^er nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad
about the ship,while the rest were stamping with their feet,
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away,
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am
not mistaken, our surgeon let thirty of them blood. But
among the passengers, there were two priests, the one an
old, and the other a young man; but what amazed me
more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight; for no
sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he
droptdown as it were without life, and to every one's ap-
pearance quite dead; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing
his arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes,
and in a quarter of an hour was well again. But soon re-
membering .this happy change, the joy of which whirled
his blood about faster than the vessels could convey it, he
became so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than
any otner place; but the surgeon giving him a sleepy
dosej he was perfectly composed the next morning. -
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his
face in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I
thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to
help him up; but he modestly told me, he was returning
his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a
few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would re-
turn rne thanks also. And indeed he did so about three
minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, w hile
the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the
gratitude of his soul. Nor did he less show his piety and
wisdom, in applying himself to his country people, and
labouring to compose them, by the most powerful reasons,
arguments, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these
people had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as
our ship would allow, we found nothing but the best of
manners,*and the most civil acknowledgments, for which
the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the
Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me
and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they
had saved some money and valuable things out of the ru-
ined vessel, which was at our service; only that they de*
sired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the
first my nephew was for accepting the money ; but I (who
knew how hard my case would have been, had the Portu-
guese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the con-
trary; and therefore told them, that as we had done no-
thing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and "hu-
manity, and what we ourselves might expect from others
in such calamity ; so we took them up to save them, not
to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to
perish for want of subsistence, and therefore would not
accept their money : but as to landing them, that was a
great difficulty ; for being bound to the East Indies, it was
impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their par-
ticular account, nor could my nephew (who was under
charter-party to pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to
the freighters. AU that we could do, was to put ourselves
in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from
the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a pas-
sage to France or England. Indeed, they were very thank-
ful for our first kindness ; but were under great concern,
especially the passengers, at their being carried to the
Ea$t Indies. They begged, therefore, I would keep on
the banks of Newfoundland, where probably they might
meet with some ship, or sloop, to carry them to Canada,
whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request,
I was inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of char-
ter-party* and that the laws of Go3 and nature obliged us
to do what good we could to our fellow-creatures ; and be-
sides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of pro-
visions: so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland,
if wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should
carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it
happened, in a week's time we made the banks of New-
foundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry
them to France. But the young priest being desirous to
go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I lik-
ed his conversation, and two or three of the French sai-
lors also entered themselves on board our ship.
Now, directing our course for the West Indies", steering"
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano-
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March
1694-5, we perceived a sail (our course S. E. and by S.)
which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and bowsprit; when
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N. N. W. we soon
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol,
fyound home from Barbadoes, out of which road she had
been forced in a hurricane to the westward, in which they
lost their masts.
They to^d us, their expectations were to see the Bahama
Islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N.
W. and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main-
course, and a kind of a square sail upon a jury fore-mast,
because they could not come near the land, were endea-
vouring to stand for the Canaries: nay, what was worse, be-
sides all their fatigue, they were almost starved for want
of provision, having ate nothing for eleven days; all that
they had a board was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and
seven casks of rum. In this ship were passengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid-servant, who were in a most de-
plorable condition for want of food. If I had not gone on
board their ship, the knowledge of their misery had been
concealed from me, and they would have inevitably perish-
ed ; though, indeed, their second mate who was Captain,.-
by reason the true Captain was not. on Boaixl when tte>
hurricane happened, had before informed me that there
were such persons on board, whom he supposed to be
dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because he had
nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we resolved
to let them have what we could spare, ordering* the-mate
to bring some of his men on board us, which he did accord-
ingly: as he and they looked like skeletons, when meat
was set before them, I ordered them to eat sparingly.
But, however, they soon fell sick; which obliged the sur-
geon to mix something in .their broth, which was to be to
them both food and physic^ When they were fed, we or-
dered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged them to see
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to pre->
vent the men from eating it raw, and consequently killing"
themselves with what was designed for their relief. But,
particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition the
poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the
men. And being curious to see this scene of misery my-
self, I took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship)
in our own boat, and sailed after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed! scarce were thi|Petua!s
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to brepc open
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs ^fe mate
gave them biscuits, which were dipped in and softefl^
with the liquor of the meat, which they called bruise ; tel-
ling them, it was for their own safety, that he wasrobliged
to give them but a little at a time; and so feeding them
gradually, their bellies were comfortably filled,and the men
did very well again. But when they came to the poor gen-
tlewoman in the cabin, who for several days had continued
without food, giving what she had to her son, they found
her as it were in the arms of death. She was sitting upon
the floor of the deck, with her back against the sides, be-
tween two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head
shrunk between her shoulders, like a senseless corpse.
Nothing was wanting in my mate to revive her and en-:
courage her ; opening her lips, and putting some broth in
her mouth with a spoon. But not having strength to spgak*
she lifted up her head with much difficulty, intimating that
it was now too late ! at the same time pointing to the youth
her son* as though she desired"him to do whatlfee could to
^avet^e lad, and in a, little time after, she died*;S * -
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched
out on a cabin bed, like one that had scarce any life. In
his mouth jvas a piece of an old glove, the rest of which
he had ate Up, At first he vomited what the mate had given
him ; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one
in the last pangs of death: her limbs were distorted, one
of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which
she grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we
separated her from it; her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame
of the cabin table ; not only being starved with hunger,
but overcome with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom
she loved most tenderly. It was a great while before the
surgeon could bring her to life, and a much longer time
before she came to her senses.
After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them *
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
with peas, flour, and other things: taking three casks of
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment,
we lefythem, but took the youth and maid with us, with
all thelfgoods. The lad was about seventeen years old,
very handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but migh-
tily concerned for the loss of his honored mother, hav-
ing lost his father at Barbadoes but a few months before.
He beseeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take
him out of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a
small sustenance, had starved his mother. But hunger
has no bounds, no right, and consequently is incapable of
any compassion. When the surgeon told him, our voy-
age might put him in bad circumstances, and farther from
his friends, he said he did not care, if he was delivered
from that terrible crew; that as the Captain (meaning me)
had saved him from death, so he was sure he would do
him no harm ; and, as for the maid, when she was restor-
ed to her senses, she would be no less thankful, let us car-
ry them where we would. And indeed the surgeon so
represented their case to me, that I consented, and took
them on board with all their goods, except eleven hogs-
heads of sugar; but the youth having a bill of lading* I
made the commander oblige himself to deliver a letter
and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, a mer-
chant in Bristol; but I believe the ship was lost at sea.
for we never could hear what became of "her afterwards.
We were now in the latitude 19 deg. 32 min. having as
yet a tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several »H-
tle incidents relating to wind and weather, I shall relate
what is most remarkable concerning my little kingdom, to
which I was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in
finding it, for as I came to, and went from it before, on the
south and east side of the island, as coming from the Bra-
zils, so now approaching between the main and the island,
not having any chart for the coast, norland mark, it oblig-
ed us to go on shore on several islands in the mouth of the
river Oroonoko, but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that
what I thought was a continent before, was no such thing,
but a long island, or rather a ridge of sands. On one of
these islands I found some Spaniards, but they belonged to
the Isle de Trinidad, who came hither in a sloop to make
salt, and try to find some pearl muscles. But at length I
came fair on the south-side of my island, and then I present-
ly knew the countenance of my little kingdom: so we
brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside within the
creek, where stood my ancient and venerable castle.
No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I
asked him where he was ? But when he looked alfttlc, he
clapped his hands, crying, u O joy, O there, O yes, O
4< there !" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a danckjg
and capering as if he was mad, and I had much ado to
keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore.
"Friday," said I, u what do you think, shall we go see
"your father?" At the mentioning his father s name, the
poor affectionate creature fell a weeping : u No, no," says
he, " me see him no more, never see, poor father more ! he
"long ago die, die long ago, he much ojd man." <* You
don't know that," said I,u but shall we see any body else r"
He looks about, and pointing to the hill above my house,
cries out, " We see, we see there much men and there
which, though I could not perceive them with my perspec-
tive glass, was true, by what the men themselves told me
the next day.
When the English ancient was spread, and three guns
fired as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoke rise
from the creek; upon which I ordered the boat out, faking
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, I
went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to
whom I kftd related the history of the first part of my 'Ufa;
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in case we had
me with any opposition.
 Vfter we had rowed directly into the creek, the first
*an I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard, whose life I
had saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I order-
ed them all to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday,
perceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped in-
to the sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was
he on shoj e, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to
embrace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man
of the firmest resolution j0o the softest tears, to see w ith
what uncommon tr^p^rtSpf joy he saluted him ; he first
kissed him, then stroked'hislace, took him in his arms, laid
him under a shady tree, sat down by him; then looked as
earnestly at him as one could do at a picture, for a quarter
of an hour together. After this he w ould lie upon the
ground, stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare
at him, as though he was bewitched ; but the next day one
could not forbear laughter to see his behaviour,for he would
yWalk several hours with his father along the shore, leading -
huml^die^^ he was a lady ; while every now
and then, he would run to the boat to get something for
him, as-a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit or something or
othe'r that was good. His frolics ran in another channel in
the afternoon ; when he set old Friday on the ground he
would dance around him, making comical postures and
gestures; and all this while would be telling him one story
or another of his travels and adventures.
It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695, that I set my
foot upon the island a second time. When my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat,
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him.
*v Seignior," said I, in Portuguese," do you not know me?"
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his at-
tendant, extended his arms, and saying something in Spa-
nish that I did not then understand, he came forward and
embraced me, saying he was inexcusable not to know his
deliverer; who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved
his life- He then beckoned to the man to call out his
companions, asking me if I would walk to my own habi-
tation, and take possession, wheie I should find some mean
improvements ; but indeed they were extraordinary ones;
for they had planted so many trees so do%e together,
that the place was like a labyrinth, which i||j|§e.ould find
out except themselves, who knew its intricate windings.
I asked him the meaning of all these fortifications? he told
me he would give a large account of what had passed
since my departure to this time, and how he had subdued
some English, who thought to be their murderers, hoping
I would not be displeased, since necessity compelled them
to it. As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him,
that I was not only far from finding fault with it, but was
rather heartily glad that they had subdued them. While
we were thus talking, the man whom he sent returned,
accompanied by eleven more, but in such habits, that it
was impossible to tell what nations they were of. He first
turned to me, and pointing to them, u These, Sir," said he,
« " are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to your
"goodness then turning to them, and pointing to me, he
made them sensible who I was; and then indeed they
saluted me one by one, not as ordinary men, but as though
they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumph-
ant conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed with
a manlike, majestic gravity, but at the same time was so
obliging and courteous, as made them agreeable to the last
degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions ofmy
kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, I
must here insert what I omitted in my former relation.
The matter is this; Just before we weighed anchor and
set sail, there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which
had like to have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time
as the courageous Captain, taking two of the most refrac-
tory prisoners, laid them in irons, threatening, as they
were concerned in the former disorders, to have them
hanged in England for running away with the ship., Thisv
frightened some of the rest, as thinking the Captain would
serve them in the same manner, though he seemed to give
them goi)d words for the present. I|ut the mate having
intelligence of this, made me acquainted with their fears;
so that, to make them more easy, and ourselves more safe
from their conspiracies, I was obligecf to go down, and pass
my honor's word for it, that upon their good behaviour,
all that was past should be forgiven them; in testimony o£
which, I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off, and*
-themselves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an
$nehor that night, in whic h there was a calm; the two men
tM^h&d. been in irons stole each of them a musket, ^4
some other weapons, and taking the ship's pinnace, not
yet hauled up, ran away to their brother rogues. The next
morning; we sent the long boat with men to pursue them,
but all in vain ; the mate in revenge, would have demol-
ished my little castle, burnt its furniture, and destroyed
their plantations, but having no orders for it, he did not put
it in execution. And thus there were five Englishmen in
the island, which caused great differences, as my faithful
Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in the following
manner:
"You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent
me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by your
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the
relation of all our voyage, being blessed with calm wea-
ther, and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my
counttymen to sec me alive, having acted as the principal
man on board, the Captain of the shipwrecked vessel dying
before ; nor was their surprise less, as knowing I was taken
prisoner by the savages of another nation, they had thought
me long since entombed in their montrous bowels. But
when I showed them the arms, ammunition, and provi-
sions I had brought for them, they looked upon me as a
second Joseph, advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immedi-
utely prepared to come along with me. Indeed they were
obliged to trespass upon their friendly savages, by borrow-
ing two of their canoes, under a pretext for fishing; and
jhey came away the next morning, but without any pror
viNions of their own, except a few roots, which served
ihem instead of bread. After three weeks absence, we ar-
nved at our habitation. Here we met with three English
sailors, who, I confess, gave us provisions, and that letter
of direction you had left us, which informed us how to
bring up tame goats, plant com, cure grapes, make pots,
and, in short, every thing that was necessary for our use.
As, in particular, I knew your method best, so taking
Friday's father to ftsist'me, we managed all the affairs;
nor were the rest of the Spaniards wanting in their kind
offices, dressing food for the Englishmen, who did nothing
but ramble and divert themselves in the wroods, either
shooting parrots, or catching tortoises. But we had not
been long ashore,4 before we were informed of two more
* Englishmen, unnaturally turnedout of their common place
of residence, by the three others above mentioned; this
made my Spaniards and me (whom they now looked
4 • . .....
as their governor u\ your absence) endeavour to persuade
them to take them in, that we might be as one family;
but all our entreaties were m vain, so that the poor fellows
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the
west, for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their stores rn; for my good
natured Spaniards giving them some seeds, they dug and
planted as I had done, and began to live prettily. But
while they were thus comfortably going on, the three un-
natural brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying hu-
mor, insulted them, by saying, the governor (meaning
you) had given them possession of the island, and d—n
'em they should build no houses upon their ground, with*
out paying rent. The two honest men (for so let me now
distinguish them) thought their three countrymen only
jested, and one of them invited them in, to see their fine
habitations; while the other facetiously told them, that
since they built the tenements with great improvements,
they should according to the custom of lords, give them a
longer lease; at the same time desiring them to fetch a
scrivener to draw the writings- One of these wretches
swearing he should pjy for the jest,snatches up a firebrand5,,
and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very fairly "set
it on fire, which would soon have consumed it, had not tluj
honest man thrust him away, and trod it out with his feet..
Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole, with which he-
would have ended his days, had not the poor man avoided
the blow, when fetching his musket, he knocked down the
villain that began the quarrel. The other two coming to
assist their fellow, obliged the honest man to take Ms* -<
musket also, and both of them presenting their pieces, bH
the villains stand off; and if they did not lay down their
arms, death should decide the dispute one way or other*
This brought them to a parley, in which they agreed to*
take their wounded.man and be gone; but they were ta
the wrong that they did not disarm them when they had
the power, and then, make their complaint to me and roy
Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented thek
'farther desigts^against them.. And indeed so many tres-
passes did they afterwards commit, by treading down thek
corn, shooting their young kids and goats, and plaguine; *
them night and day, that they resolved to come to my
castle, challenge all the three* and decide their right
one plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fail
play.
One clay it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one
of whom understood English) being in the woods, were
met by one of the honest men, who complained how bar-
barous their countrymen had been in destroying their corn,
killing their milk-goat and three kids, which deprived
them of their subsistence; and that if we did not grant
them relief, they must he inevitably starved, and so they
parted ; but when my Spaniards came home at night, and
supper being on the table, one of them began to repre-
hend the Englishmen* but in a very mannerly way; which
they resenting, replied, " What business had their coun-
44 trymen in that place without leave, when it was none of
44 their ground r" u Why," said my Spaniard, calmly Ingli-
44 .sr, they must not starve but they replied, 44 Let them
44 starve and be damn'd, they should neither plant nor build;
44 and d—n them, they should be their servants, and work
44 for them, for the island was theirs, and they would burn
44 all the huts they should find in the island." 44 By this
44 rule," said my Spaniard, smiling, u We shall be your
44 servants too.'* 44 Aye, by G-ch and so you shall," repli-
ed the impudent rascal. Upon which, stalling up, Will
Atkins cries, 44 Come, Jack, let's have t'other brush with
*4 them; who dare to build in our dominions?" Tims
leaving us something heated with just passion, away they
trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword, mut-
tering some threatening words, that Ave could then but im-
perfectly understand. 4That night they designed to mur-
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the
bower, thinking to fall upon them in their sleep; nor were
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them; for at
this juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a
much fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the
huts, and found no body there, they concluded that I and
my Spaniard had given them notice, and therefore swore
to be revenged on us. Then they demolished the poor
men's habitations: not by fire, as they attempted before,
but pulled down their houses, limb from limb, not leaving
stick nor stone on the ground where they stood, broke
their household stuff in pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled
their inclosures, and, in short, quite ruined them ofeVery
ihing they Irad. Had these people met together, no doubt
but there would have been a bloody battle; but Providence
ordered it for the better; for just as the three were got to-
gether the two were at our castle ; and when they left usf
the three came back again, but in a great rage, scoffingly
telling us what they had done; when one taking hold of a
Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, saying, "And you Seignior
"Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you dou't
"mend your manners." My Spaniard, a grave but cour-
ageous man, knocked him down with one blow of his fist;
at which another villain fired his pistol, and narrowly mis-
sed his body, but wounded him a little in the ear. Hereat
enraged, the Spaniard takes up the fellow's musket whom
he had knocked down, and would have shot him, if I and
the rest had not come out and taken their arms from eve-
ry one of them.
"These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of\is
their enemies, began to cool; but notwithstanding their
better words, the Spaniards would not return them their
arms again, telling them, they would do them no manner
of harm, if they would live peaceably; but if they offered
any injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot
them as they would do ravenous beasts. This made them
so mad, that they went away raging like furies of hell*
They were no sooner gone, but in came the two honest
men, fired with the justest rage, if such can be, having
been ruined as aforesaid. And indeed it was very hard,
that nineteen of us should be bullied by three villains, con-
tinually offending with impunity.
44 It was a gre.it while, Sir, before Ave could persuade fche
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly kiUifrg
them with their fire-arms; but we promised them justice-
should be done them, and, in the mean time, they should
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after,
these three vagrants,almost starved with hunger,drew near
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others
walking by the side of the creek, they very submissively
desired to be received into the family again. We told
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural
barbarity to their countrymen: but yet we would see what
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring
them word. After some debate, we called them in, where
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them,
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them? which
they could not deny. But here 1 was forced to interpose
sms a-mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen notiohuKi
them, being naked and unarmed, and that the other three
should make them restitution, by building their two huts,
and fencing their ground in the same manner as it was be-
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submit-
ted to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough
except as to the working part, which they did not care
for, but the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had
they continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given
them again, they scarce had them a week, when they be-
came as troublesome as ever; but an accident happening
soon after, obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and
look to our common preservation.
"One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health,
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep;
upon which, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out,
but it being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees
around the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all
one, I could not sleep; when one of my Spaniards, hear-
ing me walk about, asked who it was up? I answered, u It
"is I." When I told him the occasion,1' Sir,'' said he,u such
"things are not to be slighted, for certainly there is some
"mischief plotting again ,t us" " Where are the English-
"men ? said I. He answered," In their huts; for they lay
"separate from us, Sir, since the last mutiny." u Well,"
said 1,44 some kind spirit gives this information for ad van-
"tage. Come, let us go abroad,and see if any thing offers to
"justify our fears." Upon which I and some of my Span-
iards went up the mountain, not by the ladder, hut through
the grove, and then we were struck with a panic fear on see-
ing a light, as though it were a hi e, at a very little distance,
and hearing the voices of several men. Hereupon we re-
treated immediately, and raised the rest of our forees, and
made them sensible of the impending danger; but with all
my authority, I could not make them stay where they
were, so earnest were they to see how things went. Indeed
the darkness of the night gave them opportunity enough
to view them by the light of the fire undiscovered. As they
were in different parties, and straggling over the shore, we
were much afraid that they should find out our habitations,
and destroy our flocks of goats, to prevent which, we sent
immediately an Englishman and two Spaniards to drive
the goats into the valley where the cave lay ; or, if there*
was occasion, into the cave itself: As to ourselves, re*
suming our native courage and prudent conduct, had W$
not been divided, we durst venture to attack an hundred of
them ; but before it was very light, we resolved to send
out Friday's father as a spy, who, immediately stripping
himself naked, gets among them undiscovered, and in two
hours time brings word, that they were two parties of two
different nations, who lately having a bloody battle with
one another, happened to land by mere chance in the same
island, to devour their miserable prisoners ; that they were
entirely ignorant of any person's inhabiting here; but ra-
ther being filled with rage and fury against one other,
he bcHe\ ed, that as soon as day-light appeared, there would
be a terrible engagement. Old Friday had scarcely ended
his relation, when we heard an uncommon noise, and per-
ceived that there was a horrid engagement between the
two armies.
"Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the
Englishmen, that they would not lie close, tho1 old Friday
told them their safety depended upon it; and that if we
had patience, we should behold those savages kill one ano-
ther. However they used some caution, by going farther
into the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient
place to behold the battle.
"Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or
men of more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac-
cording to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near
two hours, tiil the party which was nearest our castle be-
gan to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors.
We were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on
this account, lest they should run into our grove, and con-
sequently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and
that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets*
for fear the report of our guns should be heard.
u And so, indeed, as we thought, it happened ; for three
of the vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it long
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also, that.the
victors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this, I
would not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised
and taken by our party; afterwards they proved very good
servants to us, being stout young creatures, and able tc>
do u great deal of work. The remainder of the conquered
savages fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean*
while the conquerors, joining together, shouted by way
of triumph, and about three in the afternoon they also em-
barked for their own nation. Thus we were freed at once
from these savages and our fears, not perceiving any one
of these creatures for1 some considerable time after. We
found two and thirty men dead in the field of battle; some
were slain with long arrows, which we found sticking; in
their bodies; and the rest were slain with great unweildy
wooden swords, which denoted their vast strength, and of
which we found seventeen, besides bows and arrows: but
we could not find one wounded creature among them alive*;
for they either kill their enemies quite, or carry those
wounded away with them.
"This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some
time, considering how unfortunate they might have been
had they fallen into their hands, who would not only kill
them as enemies, but aiso for food, as we do cattle; and
indeed so much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it
not only made them sick, but more tractable to the com-
mon necessary business of the whole society, planting,
sowing and reaping-, with the greatest signs of amity and
friendship; so that being now all good friends, we began
to consider of circumstances in general; and the first thing
we thought of was, whether, as we perceived the savages
haunted that side of the island, and there being more re-
tired parts of it, and yet as well suited to our manner of
living, and equally to our advantage, we ought not rather
to move our place of residence, and plant it in a much
safer place, both for the security of our corn, and preser-
vation of our cattle.
"After a long debate on this head, it was resolved, or
rather voted, nemine contra clictnte, not to remove our an-
cient castle, and that for this very good reason, that some
time or other we expected to hear from our supreme Gov-
ernor (meaning you Sir) whose messengers not finding
us there, might think the place demolished, and all his
subjects destroyed by the savages.
• " As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle,
we consented to have them removed to the valley where
the cave was, that being most proper, and sufficient for
both. But yet, when we considered farther, we altered
one part of our resolution, which was to remove part of outv
cattle thither, and only plant part of our corn there; so t*n\t
in case one part was destroyed, the other might be pre-
served. Another resolution we took, which really had &
great deal of prudence in it ; and that was, in not trusting
the three savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any
knowledge of the plantations we had made in the valley,
of what number of.cattle we had there, much less of the
cave, wherein we kept several arms, and two barrels of
powder you left for us at your departure from this island.
But though we could not change our habitation, we resolv-
ed to make it more fortified and more secret. To this end,
Sir, as you planted trees at some distance before the en-
trance of your palace, so we, imitating your example,
planted and filled up the whole space of ground, even to
the banks of the creek, nay, into the very ooze where the
tide flowed, not leaving a place for landing; and among
those Ihad planted, they intermingled so many short ones,
all of which growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog
could scarcely find a passage throug|g|hern. Nor was this
sufficient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the
ground, on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of
the hill, without so much as leaving a passage for our-
selves, except by the ladder; which being taken down, no-
thing but what had ,wings or witchcraft, could pretend to
come near us. And indeed this was exceedingly well
contrived, especially to serve that occasion, for which we
afterwards found it necessary.
"Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav-
ing all this time not one visit from the savages. Indeed
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some a-
mazemcnt; for a few of my Spaniards being out very ear-
ly, perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were com-
ing on shore ; upon which returning home with great pre-
cipitation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to
keep at home all that clay and the next, going out only in
the night time to make our observations; but as good luck
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not
land that time upon the island.
"But now there happened another quarrel between the
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards.—.
The occasion was this : One of them being enraged atone
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not being
able to comprehend something which he was showing him,
snatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but
to kill him; yet missing his head, gave him such a bar-
barous cut in the shoulder, that he had like to have struck
pff his arm; at which one of my good natured Spaniards
interposing between the Englishman and the savage, be-
seeched the former not to murder the poor creature ; but
this kindness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life,
for the Englishman struck at him in the same manner;
which he nimbly and wisely avoiding, returned upon him
suddenly with his shovel (being all at work about their
corn land) and very fairly knocked the brutish creature
down. Hereupon another Englishmanxoming to his as-
sistance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth; when im-
mediately two others coming to his relief, were attacked
by the third Englishman, armed with an old cutlass, who
wounded them both. This uproar soon reached our ears,
when we rushing out upon them, took the three English-
men prisoners, and then our next question was, what we
should do with such mutinous and impudent fellows, so
furious, desperate »JH idle, that they were mischievous to
the highest degree, and consequently not safe for the so-
ciety to let them live among them.
"Now, Sir, as I was Governor in your absence, sol al-
so took the authority of a judge; and having them bro't
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my coun-
try, I would have hanged every mother's son of them;
but since it was an Englishman (meaning you, kind Sir)
to whom we were indebted for our preservation and deli-
verance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all possible
mildness ; but at the same time leave them to the judg-
ment of theothc two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forget-
ting their resentments, would deal impartially by them.
"Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: "Sir/*
said he, " leave it not for us, for you may be sensible we
have reason to sentence them to the gallows : besides, Sir,
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to
us that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we
could not consent to ; but knowing their inability and your
vigilance, we did not think fit to discover it before now."
"How, Seignior," said I, " do you hear what is alledg-
"ed against you ? What can you say to justify so horrid an
"action as to murder us in cold blood ?" So far, Sir, was the
wretch from denying it, that he swore d—n him but he
would do it still. u But what have we done to you, Seignior
Atkins," said I, "or what will you gain by killing tts?
What shall we do to prevent you ? Must we kill you, pr
you kill us? Why will you Seignior Atkins," said I, smil-
ing, " put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a fataine-
& cessity?" But to so great a rage did my scoffing and yet
severe jest put him into, that he was going to fly at me,
and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if he had been
possessed of weapons, and had not been prevented by three
Spaniards. This unparailelled and villainous carnage,
made us seriously consider what was to be done. The two
Englishmen, and the Spaniard who had saved the poor
Indian's life, mightily petitioned me to hang one of them,
for an example to the rest, which should be him that had
twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it be-
ing at that time thought impossible that the poor slave
could recover. But they could never gain my consent to
put him to death, for the reasons above mentioned, since
it was an Englishman (even yourself) who was my deliv-
erer; and as merciful counsels are most prevailing when
earnestly pressed, so I got them to bj$ of the same opinion,
as to clemency. But to prevent them doing us any farther
mischief, wc all agreed that they should have no weapons,
as sword, gun, powder or shot, but be expelled from the
society, to live as they pleased by themselves; that neither
the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the Spaniards should
have conversation with them on any account whatsoever;
that they should be kept from coming within a certain dis-
tance from the castle, and if they dared to offer us any vi-
olence, either by spoiling, burning, killing or destroying
any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle3
belonging to the society, we would shoot them as freely
as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places
should find them.
"This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves;
when, like a merciful judge, I called out to the two hon-
est Englishmen, saying, "you must consider they ought
not to be starved neither; and since it will be some time-
before they can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us
give them some corn to last them eight months, and for
seed to sow, by which time they'll raise some for them-
selves j let us also bestow upon them six milch goats, four
he ones and six kids, as well for their present support, as
for a further encrease; with tools necessary for their work,
as hatchets, an axe, saw, and other things convenient t
build them huts all which were agreed : but before t
took them into possession, I obliged them to so
ly swear, never to attempt any thing against us,
countrymen, for the future. Thus dismissing th
 
our society, they went away, sullen and refractory, as tho*
neither willing to go nor stay; however, seeing no reme-
dy, they took what provisions were given them, proposing
to choose a convenient place where they might live by
themselves.
"About five days after, they came to those limits ap-
- pointed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by
one of my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an habita-
tion and plantation, the N. E. and most remote part of the
island. And there they built themselves two very hand-
some cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the
side of a mountain, with some trees already growing on
three sides of it; so that planting a few more, it would
be obscured from sight, unless particularly sought for.
When these huts were finished, we gave them some dry
goat-skins, for bedding and covering; and upon their giv-
ing us fuller assurances of their good behaviour for the fu-
ture, we gave them some peas, barley and rice for sow-
ing, and whatever tools we could spare.
"Six months did they live in this separate condition,
in which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of
which was but small, because they had planted but little
land; for indeed all their plantations being to form, made
it more difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their
element; and when they were obliged to make their
boards and pots, See. they could make but little or nothing
of it. But the rainy season coming on, put them into a
greater perplexity for want of a cave to keep their corn
dry, and prevent it from spoiling: and so much did this
humble them, that they begged of my Spaniards to help
them, to which the good-natured men readily consented,
and in four days' space, worked a great hole in the side of
the hill for them, large enough for their purpose, to se-
cure their corn and other things from the rain, though
not to be compared to ours, which had several additional
apartments.
4" But a new whim possessed these rogues about three
quarters of a year afterwards, which had like to have ruin-
A us and themselves too: for it seems, being tired and
of this sort of living, which made them work for
Ives, without hopes of changing their condition)
vould serve them but that they would make a voy*
continent, and try if they could seize upon some
 
of the savages, and bring them over as slaves, to do their
'rudgery, while they lived at case and pleasure.
"Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they
had not gone further; but they neither did nor proposed
any thing but what had mischief in the design or the event
One morning, these three fellows came down to the II-
mitted station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk
with us, which we readily granted; they told us, in short,
that being tired of their manner of living, and the labour
of their hands in such employments not being sufficient
to procure the necessaries of life, they only desired one
of the canoes we came over in, with some arms and am-
munition for their defence, and they would seek their for-
tunes abroad, and never trouble us any more. To be
sure we were glad enough to get rid of such wretched
plagues; but yet honesty made us ingenuously represent
to therri, by what we had already suffered ourselves, the
certain destruction they were running into, either of being
starved to death, or murdered by the savages. To which
they very audaciously replied, that they neither could nor
would work; and consequently, that they might as well
be starved abroad as at home, and as to their falling into
the hands of the savages, why, if they were murdered, it
was nothing to us, there was an end of them; neither had
they any wives or children to cry after them; nay, so in-
tent were they upon their voyage, that if the Spaniards
had not given them arms, so thevAad but the canoe, they
would have gone without theiBs^P^
"Though we could not well spare our fire arms, rather
than they should go like naked men, we let them have
two muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which
were thought very sufficient; we gave them also goats-
flesh, a great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh
butter, a young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to
carry twenty men. And thus, with a mast made of a long
pole, and a sail of six large goat skins dried, having a fair
breeze, and a flood tide with them, they merrily sailed
away, the Spaniards calling after them Bon vei/ajo> no man
ever expecting to see them more.
. "When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen
would often say to one another, " O how peaceably do w§«
a now live, since those turbulent fellows have left us I**-.
Notht% could be farther from their thoughts than, to be*
hold tlieir faces any more; and yet scarce two and twea*
ty days had passed over their heads, but one of the En-
glishmen, being abroad a planting, perceived at a distance
three men, well armed, approaching him. Away he iiies
with speed to our castle, and tells me and the rest, that
ye were all undone, for that strangers had landed upon the
island, and who they were he could not tell; but added
that they were not savages, but men habited, bearing arms.
Why then, said I, we have the less occasion to be con-
cerned, since, if they were not Indians, they must be
friends; for I am sure there is no good Christian upon
earth who would not rather do us good than harm. But,
while we were consideringof the event, up came the three
Englishmen, whose voices we quickly knew, and so all
our admiration of that nature ceased at once. And our
wonder was succeeded by another sort of enquiry, which
"was, what could be the occasion of their returning so quick-
ly to the island, when we little expected, much less desir-
ed their company? But as this was better to be related by
themselves, I ordered them to be brought in, when they
gave me the following relation of their voyage.
"After two days sail, or something less, they reached
land, where they found the people coming to give them a
different sort of reception from what they expected and
desired; for, as the savages were armed with bows and
arrows, they durst not venture on shore, but steered
northward, six or seven hours, till they gained an opening,
by which they plainly perceived, that the land that appear-
ed from this place, was not the main land, but an island.
Al their entrance into the opening of the sea, they discov-
ered another island on the right hand northward, and se-
veral more lying to the westward ; but being resolved to
go on shore some where or other, they put over to the
western Islands. Here they found the natives very cour-
teous to them, giving them several roots and dried fish;
nay, even their women were willing to supply them with
what they could procure them to eat, bringing it a great
"way to them upon their heads. Among these hospitable
Indians they continued some days, inquiring by signs and
tokens, what nations lay around them ; and were inform-
ed that there were several fierce and terrible people lived
every way, accustomed to eat mankind ; . but for them-
selves they never used such diet, except those that were
taken in battle, and of them they made a solemn J^tsi,
173
"The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they
had a feast of that kind? They answered, about two moons
ago, pointing to the moon; and then two fingers'; that, at
this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen
were mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the
others mistaking, thought that they wanted some of them
for their own food: upon which they beckoned to them,
pointing to the rising, and then to the setting of the sun;
meaning, that by the time it appeared in the east next
morning, they would bring them some ; and indeed they
were as good as their word; for by that time they brought
eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and
oxen are brought to a sea-port town, to victual a ship. But
as brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turn-
ed at the sight. What to do in this case, they could not
tell; to refuse the prisoners, would have been the highest
affront offered to the savage gentry; and to dispose of them
they knew not in what manner; however, they resolved to
accept them, and so gave them, in return, one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their*
bullets; things which, tho* they were wholly ignorant of>
yet they seemed entirely contented with ; and dragging the
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest the
donors should have expected two or three of them to be
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day; and so-
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though
neither of them understood what the others said, they sail-
ed away back to the first island, and there set eight of the
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to
comfort, and have some conversation with the poor cap-
tives; but it was impossible to make them sensible of any-
thing; and nothing they could say or give, ordofor thenv
could make them otherwise persuaded, but that they were*
unbound only to be devoured: if they gave them any foot^
they thought it was only to fatten them for the slaughter
or looked at any one more particularly, the pooj* crea-
ture supposed itself to be the first sacrifice; and &\*ett
"when we brought them to our island, and began to tis^
them with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet the%\
expend every day, that their new masters would devouV
them. . -:
V 2
"And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers con-
clude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which
was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked
them, where- their new family was? They told me, they
had put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg
some victudls for them. This, jndeed, made,*s all long
to see them ; anil taking Friday's father with us, leaving*
only two at our castle, we came down to behold these poor
creatures.
u When we arrived at the hut (they being bound again
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping) we found them
stark, naked, expecting their fatal tragedy; there were
three hasty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five wo-
men, two of whom might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above four and twenty; and the last, a comely tali
maiden of about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
#came to be clothed.
i4 This naked appearance, together with their miserable
oircumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Span*
.Sards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without
flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for
they immediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew
liny of them, or if he understood what they could say.
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at
them with great seriousness; yet, as they were not of his
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could
understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was
enough to answer the design, which was to assure them
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they
were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such
strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible
for me to describe. But the woman, their interpreter,.was
ordered next to inquire, whether they were content to be
servants, and would work for the men who had brought
them hither to save their lives! Hereupon (beings at this
time unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, <)ne tak*
ing this thing upon her shoulders, and tl£e otherA&U in-
timating, that they were willing to do my thing fsrfoeia*
But now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading that
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the
three' men what they would do, and how they intended to
use these creatures, whether as servants or women? One
of them very pertly and readily answered, they would use
them as both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own
masters, I am not going to restrain you from that; but me-
thinks, for avoiding dissentions among you, I would only
desire you to engage, that none of you will take more than
one for a woman or wife, and that having taken this one,
none else should presume to touch her; for though we
have not a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is but rea-
sonable, that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obli-
ged to maintain her, since nobody has any thing to do with
her; and this indeed, appeared so just to all present, that
it was unanimously agreed to. The Englishmen then ask-
ed my Spaniards, whether they designed to take any of
them ? but they all answered, No ; some declaring they had
already wives in Spain, and others that they cared not to
join with infidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took
each of them a temporary wife, and so set up a new method
of living. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the
three savage servants we had taken in the late battle, they
all lived with me in our ancient castle; and indeed we sup-
plied the main part of the island with food, as necessity re-
quired. But the most remarkable part of the story is, how
these Englishmen, who had been so much at variance,
should agree about the choice of these women ; yet they
took a way good enough to prevent quarrelling among
themselves. They set the five women in one of their
huts, and going themselves to the other, drew lots which
should have the first choice. Now he that had the first
lot went to the hut, and fetched out her he chose; and it
is remarkable, that he took her that was the most home-
ly and eldest of the number, which made the rest of the
Englishmen exceedingly merry; the Spaniards them-
selves could not but smile at it; but, as it happened* th^
fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for appiiV,
cation and business; and indeed she proved the best wife
of all the^parcel.
u But when the poor creatures perceived themselves pla-
ced iaa row, and separated one by one, they were again
sei^Bteth an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they
were^ing to be slain in earnest; and when the JEnglisii^
 
men came to take the first, the rest set up a lamentable
cry, clasped their arms around her neck, and hanging a-
bout her, took their last farewell, us they thought, in such
trembling agonies, and affectionate embraces, as would
have softened the hardest heart in the world, and make the
driest eyes melt into tears; nor could they be persuaded
but that they were going to die, tiil such time as Friday's
father made them sensible that the Englishmen had cho-
sen them for their wives, which ended all their terror and
concern upon this occasion.
u Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and
being assisted by my good natured Spaniards, in a few
hours they erected every one of them a new hut, or tent
for their separate lodging, since those they had already
were filled with tools, household stuff, and provision. They
all continued on the north shore of the island, but separate
as before ; the three wicked ones pitching farther off, and
tiie two honest men nearer our castle; so that the island
seemed to be peopled in three places, three towns begin-
ning to be built for that purpose. And here I cannot but
remark, what is very common, that the two honest men
had the worst wives (J mean as to Industry, cleanliness
and ingenuity) while the three reprobates enjoyed women
of quite contrary qualities.
u But another observation I made was, in favour of the
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between
a diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a
slohful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both
of them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn
to sow, sufficient for them ; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation or their plant-
ing. Tne two honest men had a multitude of young trees
ph.nted about their habitations, so that when you approach-
ed near tnem, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing
and delightful. Every thing they did prospered and flou-
rished; their grapes, planted in order, seemed as though
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely preferable to
any of the others. Nor were they wanting to find out a
place of retreat, but dug a cave in the most retired part of
a thick wood, to secure their w ives and children, with their
provisi n and chiefest goods, surrounded with innumera-
ble stakes, and having a most subtle entrance, in case any
mischief should happen, either from their fellow |jjpUry -
men> or the devouring savages.
"As to the reprobates (though I must own they were
much more civilized than before) instead of a delightful
wood surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of
King Solomon too truly verified; u I went by the vineyard
"of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns."
In many phces their crop was obscured by weeds; the
hedges having several gaps in them, the wild goats had
got in, and eaten up the corn, and here and there was a
dead bush to stop these gaps for the present which was no
more than shutting the stable door after the steed was stol-
en away. But as to their wives, they (as observed before)
were more diligent, and cleanly enough, especially in their
victuals, being instructed by one of the honest men, who
had been a cook's mate on board a ship : and very %ell it
was so; for as he cooked himself, his companion and their
families lived as well as the idle husbands, who did no-
thing but loker about, fetch turtle's eggs, catch fish and
birds, and do any thing but work, and lived accordingly;
while the diligent lived very handsomely and plentifully,
in the most comfortable manner.
"And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a scene
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us
before, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time off your
residence in this island. I shall inform you of its original
in the following manner:
"One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or six
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their otd cus-
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to do
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, not
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, af-
ter performing their bloody execution: whoever first dis-
covered the savages, was to give notice to all the three plan-
tations to keep within doors, and then a proper scout was
to be placed to give intelligence of their departure. But
notwithstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster
discovered us to the savages, which was like to have caus-
ed the desolation of the whole island ; for after the savages
were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and
I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curiosity to
see what they had been doing, to our great amazement
beheld three savages fast asleep on the ground, wko, ei-
ther being gorged, could not awake when the others went
off, or^aving wandered too far into the woods, did not
come oaek in time
"What to do with them at first, we could not tell; as for
slaves we had enough of them already ; and as to killing
them, neither Christianity or humanity would suffer us to
shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong. We
perceived they had no boat left to transport them to their
own nation ; and that by letting them wander about, they
might discover us, and inform the first savages that should
happen to land upon the same bloody occasion, which in-
formation might entirely ruin us; and therefore I coun-
selled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them about
some work or other, till we could better dispose of
them.
"Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake,
took4hem prisoners. It is impossible to express the hor-
ror they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they
"were going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon eased
them of their fear as to that point. We first took them to
the bower, where the chief of our country work lay, as
keeping goats, planting corn, &:c. and then carried them
to the two Englishmen's habitation, to help them in their
business; but happy it was for us all we did not carry
them to our castle, as by the sequel will appear. The
Englishmen, indeed, found them work to do; but whether
they did not guard them strictly, or that they thought they
could not better themselves, I cannot tell ; but certainly
one of them ran away into the woods, and they could not
hear of him for a long time after.
"Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he
got home in some of the canoes, the savages returning in
about four weeks time, and going off in the space of two.,
days. You may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but
terrify us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that
the savage would inform his countrymen of our abode in
the island, how few atid weak we were in comparison to
their numbers; and we expected it would not be long be-
fore the Englishmen would be attacked in their habita-
tions; but the savages had not seen their places of safety
in the woods, nor our castle, which it was a great happi-
ness they did not know.
"Nor were wc mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc-
casion ; for about eight months after this, six canoes* with
about ten men in each c*noe, came^sailing by the north*
side of the island, which they were rieveraccuston^ todp
beforq, and landed about an hour after sunrise, nearanaite
179
from the dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems,
had the good fortune to discover them ab<»ut a league off:
so that it was an hour before they could attain the shore,
and some time longer before they could come at them.
And now being confirmed in this opinion that they were
certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves
which were left, causing two of the three men, whom they
brought with the women, and who proved very faithful, to
lead them with their wives, and other conveniences, into
their retired cave in the wood, and there to bind the two
fellows hand and foot, till they had further orders. They
then opened their fences, where they kept their milch goats
and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble
in the woods, to make the savages believe that they^ivere
wild ones; but the slave had given a truer information,
which made them come to the very enclosures. The two
frighted men sent the other slave of the three, who had
been with them by accident, to alarm the Spaniards, and
desire their assistance; in the mean time they took their
arms and ammunition, and made to the cave where they
had sent their wives, and securing their slaves, seated
themselves in a private place, from whence they might be-
hold all the actions of the savages. Nor had they gone far,
when ascending a rising ground, they could see a little ar-
my of Indians approach to their beautiful dwelling, and in
a few moments more, perceive the same, and their furni^
ture, to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming
flame ; and when this was done, they spread here and
there, searching every bush and place for the people, of
whom it was very evident they had information. Upon
which the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves secure
where they stood, retreated half a mile higher in the coun-
try, rightly concluding, that the farther the savages stroll-
ed, there would be less numbers together: upon which
they next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree, very
hollow and large, whence they resolved to see what would
offer ; but they had not stood long there before two sava-
ges came running directly towards them, as though having
knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved to
attack them; a little farther were three more, and five
more behind them again, all running the same way. If
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in
at this sight, thinking that if assistance did not speedily
<&ms, their cave in the wood would be discovered^ antl toj>
sequently all therein lost ; so they resolved to resist them
there, and when overpowered, to ascend to the top ot the
trees, where they might defend themselves as long as their
ammunition lasted, and sell their lives as dear as possible
to those devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolution,
they next considered, whether they should fire at the first
two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party,
by which the two first and the five last would be separated.
In this regulation the two savages also confirmed them, by
turning a little to another part of the wood ; but the three,
and the five after them, came directly towards the tree.
Hereupon they resolved to take them in a direct line, as
they approached nearer, because perhaps the first shot
mighf hit them all three ; and upon this occasion, the man
who was to fire, charged his piece with three or four bul-
lets. And thus while they were waiting, the savages came
on, one of them was the runaway, who had caused all the
mischief; so they resolved he should not escape, if they,
both fired at once. But, however, though they did not
fire together, they were ready charged ; when the first that
let fly was too good a marksman to miss his aim, for he
killed the foremost outright, the second (who was the run-
away Indian) fell to the ground, being shot through the
body, but not dead, and the third was a little wounded in
the shoulder, who sitting down on the ground, fell a scream-
ing in a most fearful manner. The noise of the guns,
which not only made the most resounding echoes, from
one side to the other, but raised the birds of all sorts, flut-
tering with the most confused noise, so much terrified the
five savages behind, that they stood still at first, like so ma-
ny inanimate images. But when all things were in pro-
found silence, they came to the place where their compa*
nions lay ; and here, not being sensible that they were lia-
ble to the same fate, stood over the wounded man, undoubt-
edly inquiring the occasion of this sad calamity; and 'tis
as reasonable to suppose, he told them, that it came by
thunder and lightening from the gods,having never seen or
beard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives.
By this time the Englishmen, haying loaded their pieces*
fired both together a second time, seeing them all fall
immediately on the ground, they thwght they had killed
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly
before they had charged their guns4 which indeed, was a
wrong step; for when they came to the place, they- fo*m<J
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not
at all, which obliged them to fall upon them%ith their
muskets; they first knocked the runaway savage on the
head, and another that was but a little wounded in the
arm, and then put the other languishing wretches out of
their pain; while he that was not hurt, with bended knees
and uplifted hands, made piteous moans, and signs to
them to spare his life; nor indeed, were they unmerciful
to the poor wretch, but pointed to b$rn to sit down at tj^e
root of a tree hard by; and then, one of the EngUshmeajj
with a piece of rope twine he had in his pocket, by. ra^gf^j
chance, tying his two feet fast together, and his two hanas
behind him, they left him there, making all the haste they,
could after the other two, fearing they should find out
their cave; but tho* they could not overtake them, they
had the satisfaction to perceive them at a distance, cro$s#
valley towards the sea, a quite contrary way to their re-
treat; upon which they returned to the tree, to look after
their prisoner; but when they came there, he was gone,
leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he was bound,
behind him.
"Well, now they were as mt^ch concerned as ever., as
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to sec
if all was well there, and found every thing safe, except
the women, who were frightened upon their husbands ac-
count, whom they now loved entirely. They had not been
long here, before seven of my Spaniards came to assist
them; while the other ten, their servants and Friday's fa-
ther, were gone to defend their bower, corn, ajid cattle^in
case the savages should have rambled so far. There ac-
companied the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages
that had formerly been taken prisoner ; and with them al-
so that very Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little.be-
fore, left under the tree ; for it seems, they passed by that
way where the slaughter was made, and so carried along
with them that poor wretch that was left bound. But so
many prisoners now besoming a burthen to us, and fe$fgfe&
the dreadful e^^e^uence of their escaping, most of m&
Spaniards and Mi^ish^%ffe<l the absolute necessity there
was of killing tnem for.tecomraon preservation ; hut, Sir,
the authority'! bore a&agovernor, over-ruled that pk*ce of
crudity i and then I ordered them to be sent prisoners tor
 
 
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
the old cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, with two
Spaniards to guard them.
"So mueh encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap-
proach of the Spaniards, and s?o great was their fury
against the savages for destroying their habitations, that
they had not patience to stay any longer; but taking five
Spaniards along with them, armed with four muskets, a
pistol, and a quarter staff, away they went in pursuit of
their enemies. A* they passed by the place where the
tasavages were slain, it was very easy to be perceived that
%>ore of them had been there, having attempted to carry
off their dead bodies, but found it impracticable. From
a rising ground, our party had the mortification to see the
smoke that proceeded from the ruins ^ when coming far-
ther in sight of the shore, they plainly perceived that the
savages had embarked in their canoes, and were putting
out to sea. This they wtfre very sorry for, there being no
coming at them to give them a parting salute ; but how-
ever, they were glad enough to get clear of such unwel-
come guests.
"Thus the "two honest, but unfortunate Englishmen,
being ruined a second time, and their improvements quite
destroyed,mostof my good natured Spaniards helped them
to rebuild, and we all assisted them with needful supplies j
nay, what is more remarkable, their three mischievous
countrymen, when they heard of it (which was after all
these disasters were over, they living more remote east-
ward) very friendly sympathised with them, and worked
for them several days; so that, in a little time, their habi-
tations were rebuilt, their necessities supplied, and them-
selves restored to their former tranquillity.
u Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this
adventure (several canoes being driven ashore, followed
by two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a
storm at sea, that very night they departed) yet it was na-
tural to suppose, that those whose better fortune it was to
reach their native shore, would inflame1 their nation to an-
other ruinous attempt, with a greater force* to carry all be-
fore them. And indeed, so it happened 1'€qy about seven
months after, our island was invaded ^ItKa;VfrSst formida-
ble navy, no less than eight and twenty ciiitoe^fuMof sav-
ages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous cjfel^, bows
and arrows, and such like instruments of war? &(lsg
?he east-end of the island.
"You may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation* -our
men were in upon this account, and how speedy they were
to execute their resolution, having only that night's time
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not
withstand their enemies, concealment was the only way
to procure their safety; and therefore, they took down,
the huts that were built for the two Englishmen, and
drove their flocks of goats, together with their own at the
bower, to the old cave in the valley, leaving as little ap-
pearance of inhabitants as possible; and then posted them-
selves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two men.
As they expected, so it happened; for early next morn-
ing, the Indians, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the.
island, came running along the shore, about two hundred
and fifty in number, as near as could be guessed. Our ar-
my was but little indeed; and what was our greatest mis-
fortune, we had not arms sufficient for them. The account,
as to the men, Sir, is as follows; viz. 17 Spaniards, 5 En-
glishmen, Old Friday, the three savages, taken with the*
five women, who proved faithful servants, and three other
slaves, living with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had
11 muskets, 5 pistols, 3 fowling pieces, 2 swords, 3 old
halberts, 5 muskets or fowling pieces, taken from the sai-
lors whom you reduced. As to the slaves, we gave three
of them halberts, and the other three long stavesr with
great iron spikes at the head of them, with hatchets by their
sides, we also had hatchets sticking in our girdles, besides
the fire-arms; nay, two of the women, inspired with Ama-
zonian fortitude, could not be dissuaded from fighting"
along with their dear husbands, and if they died, to die with
them. Seeing their resolution, we gave them hatchets
likewise; but what pleased them best, were the bows and
arrows (which they dextrously knew how to use) that the
Indians had left behind them, after their memorable but?
tie one against another.
"Over this army, which though little, was of great in-
trepidity, I was* constituted chief general and commander,
and knowing Will iVtkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet
a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of com-
manding under me; he had six men with their muskets
loaded with six or seven bullets a-piece, and were ;j>|Unted
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced gtiard*
having orders to let the first pass by j and then, when lie Er-
ect into the middle of them, making a nimble retreat round
a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the Span-
iards, who were shaded by a thicket of trees: for though
the savages came on with the fierceness of lions, yet they
wanted the subtiiity of foxes, being out of ail manner .of
order, and straggling in heaps every way ; and, indeed,
when Will Atkins, after fifty of the savages had passed by,
had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was
their consternation, to see so many men killed and wound-,
ed, and hear such a dreadful noise, and yet knew not from
whence it came, that they were frightened to the highest
degree; and when the second volley was given, they con-
cluded no less but that their companions were slain by
thunder and lightening from Heaven. In this notion they
would have continued, had Will Atkins and his men retir-
ed, as soon as they fired, according to order; or had the
rest been near them, to pour in their shot continually, there
.might have been a complete victory obtained; but staying
to load their pieces again, discovered the whole matter.
They were perceived by some of the scattering savages at
a distance, who let ily their arrows among them, wounded
Atkins, and killed his fellow Englishman, and one of the
Iiuliafti taken with the women. Our party did not fail to
answer them, and in their retreat killed about twenty sav-
agBfc. Here I cannot but take notice of our poor dying
( slave, who, tho' stoptfrom his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet
w^ nis sta^anc^ hatchet, desperately and gallantly assail-
j( f^t'his pursuers, and killed five of the savages, before his
o$ifo submitted to multiplicity of wounds. Nor is the cruelty
*>r!-;;^iicc cf the Indians to be less remarked, in breaking
the arms, legs and heads of the two dead bodies, with their
clubs and wooden swords, after a most wretched manner.
As Atkins retreated, our party advanced to interpose be-
tween him and the savages; but after three voilics, we
were obliged to retreat also; for they were so numerous
and desperate, that they came up to our very teeth, shot
their arrows like a cloud, and their wounded men enraged
with cruel pain, fought like madmen. They did not how-
ever, think fit to follow us, but drawing themselves up in a
c:-rcle, thev gave two triumphant shouts in token of victory,
though they had the grief to see several of their wounded
men bleed to dc.ith belore them. .
After 1 had, Sir, drawn up our little army together^
upon a rising ground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would
liuye had us attack the whole body of the savages at or$%:
I was extremely well pleased, with the gallantry of the
man : but, upon consideration, I replied, " You perceive,
"Seignior Atkins, how their wounded men fight; let them
"alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff and sore,
"and then we shall have fewer to combat with." To
which Atkins, smiling replied, "That's very true, Seig-
"nior, so shall I too; and that's the reason I would fight
"them now I am warm." We all answered, Seignior
Atkins, for your part, you have behaved very gallantly;
and, if you are not able to approach the enemy in the
morning, we will fight for you, till then we think it con-
venient to Wait, and so we tarried.
"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve
to fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one
volley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to
do, by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, be-
tween the woods and the sea-side westward, and turnings
short south, came privately to a place where the thickest of
them were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired
among them, and did dreadful execution ; and in half a
minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wound-
ing abundance of them, and then dividing ourselves into
three bodies, eight persons in each body, we marched
from among the trees, to the very teeth of the enemy,
sending forth the greatest shouts and acclamations. The
savages hearing a different noise from three quarters-at
once, stood in the utmost confusion ; but coming in sight
of us, let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor-old.
Friday, yet happily it did not prove mortal. We did not,
however, give them a second opportunity; but rushing in
among them, we fired three several ways, and then fell to
work with our swords, staves, hatchets, and the butt-end
of our muskets, with a fury not to be resisted; so that, with
the most dismal screaming and howling they had recourse
to their feet, to save their lives by a speedy flight. Nor
must we forget the valour of the two women; for they
exposed themselves to the greatest dangers, killed man?
with their arrows, and valiantly destroyed several more
with their hatchets.
"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired,
that we did not then trouble ourselves to pursue them'to
msircauoesj. in which we thought they would presently'-
put to the ocean; but there happening a dreadful storm at
sea, which continuing ail that night, it not only prevented
their voyage, but clashed several of their boats to pieces
against the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the
shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off. After
our men had taken some refreshment and a little repose,
.they resolved early in the morning to go towards the place
of their landing, and sec whether they were gone off, or in
; what posture they remained. This necessarily led them
to the place of battle, where several of the savages were
'expiring, a sight no way pleasing to generous minds, to
delight in misery, though obliged to conquer them b^ the
law of arms; but our own Indian slaves put them out of
^ their pain, by dispatching them with their hatchets. At
length, conning in view of the remainder of the army, we
•found them leaning upon their knees, which were bended
towards their mouth, and the head between the two hands.
Hereupon, coming within musket-shot of them, I ordered
two pieces to be fired without ball, in order to alarm them,
that we might plainly know, whether they had the courage
to venture another battle, or were utterly dispirited from
such an attempt, that so we might accordingly manage
them. And, indeed, the project took very well ; for, no
sooner did the savages hear the first gun, and perceive the
flash of the.second,but they suddenly started upon their
fact, in'fhe greatest consternation: and when we approach-
ed towards them, they ran howling and screaming away
up the hill into the country.
"We could rather, at first, have wished, that the wea-
ther had permitted them to have gone off to the sea; but
when we considered, that their escape might occasion the
approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin and dissolution,
we were very well pleased the contrary happened: and
• Will Atkins (who, though wounded, would not part from
its aU this while) advised us not to let slip this advantage,
but clapping between them and their boats, deprive them
of the capacity of ever returning to plague the island:
"I know," said he, "there is but one objection ypu can
*c make, which is, that these creatures living like beasts
"in the wood, may make excursions, rifle the plantations,
"and destroy the tame goats ; but then, consider, we had
u better to do with an hundred men, whom we can kill,
"or make slaves of at leisure, than with an hundred' na*
"lions, whom it h impossible we should save o^fseWil
"from, much less subdue." This advice, and these ar-
guments being approved of, we set fire to their boats; and
though they were so wet that we could not burn them en-
tirely, yet we made them incapable for swimming in the
seas. As soon as the Indians perceived what we were do-
ing, many of them ran out of the woods, in sight of us,
and kneeling down, piteously cried out, Ocr, Oa, Warama*
koa. Intimating, I suppose, that if we would but spam
their canoes, they never would trouble us again.
"But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties,
were in vain; for self preservation obliging us to the con-
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped
the fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived this,
they raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods,
where they continued ranging about, making the woods ,
ring with their lamentation. Hire we should have con-
sidered that makiwg these creutures thus desperate, we
ought, at the samcitime to have set a sufficient guard upon
the plantations: for-the savages, in their ranging about,
found out the bower, destroyed the fences, trod the corn
down under their feet and tore up the vines and grapes.
It is true we were always able to fight these creatures;
but, as they were too swift for us, and very numerous, we;
durst not go out single, for fear of them, though tb*t too
was needless, they having no weapons, nor an yjr^tie rials
to make them ; and indeed, their extremity appeared in
a little time after.
"Though the savages, as already?mentioned, had des-
troyed our bower, and ali our corn, grapes, :yet asfe^/
had still left our stock of cattie in the valley, by the cave;,
with some little corn that grew there, and the plantation
of Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being
killed by an arrow, they were now reduced to two: it is re-
markable that this was the fellow who cut the poor Indiar
with his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so low3
we came to the resolution to drive the savages up to the
farther part of the island, where no Indians landed ; 'to kill
as many of them as we could, till we had reduced their
number; and then to give the remainder some corn to
plant, and to teach them how to li\ e by their daily labour.
/^QCQrclingly we pursued them with our guns, at the hear-
J^^^hich they were so terrified, that they Hvculd fall to
J^^^^und. , Every day we killed and wouaded some of
 
them, and many were found starved to death, so that our
hearts began to relent at the sight of such miserable ob-
jects. At last, with great difficulty, taking one of them
alive, and using him with kindness, and tenderness, we
brought him to Old Friday, who talked to him, and told
him, how good we would be to them ail, giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and present nourishment,
provided they should keep within such bounds as should
be allotted them, and not do prejudice toothers: "Go
"then," said he, "and inform your countrymen of this;
"which, if they will not agree to, everyone of them shall
"be slain."
u The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being re-
duced to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and
earnestly begged for food : hereupon we sent twelve Span-
iards and two Englishman, well armed, together with Old
Friday, and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large
quantity of bread and rice cakes, with three live goals i
and the poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side
of the hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their
bounds, where at this day, they quietly and happily rc-
fhain, and where we now and then visit them. They are
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half broad,
and three or four in length, on the south-east corner of the
island, the sea being before, and lofty mountains, behind
them, free from the appearance of canoes; and indeed
their countrymen never made any enquiry after them.
We gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
have taught them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant
corn, make bread, breed tame goats and milch them, as
likewise to make wicker-work, in which I must ingenous-
ly confess, they infinitely outdo us, having made them-
selves several pretty necessaries and fancies, as baskets,
sieves, bird-cages, and cupboards, as also stools, beds, and
couches, no less useful than delightful ; and now they live
the most innocent and inoffensive creatures that ever were
subdued in the world, wanting nothing but wives to make
ihem a nation.
u Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my
ability, an impartial account of the various transactions
that have happened in the island since your departure, to
this day; and we have great reason to acknowle^^;;|||-fe,
kind providence of Heayen in our merciful deli\^^^;,
 
When you inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it
some little improvement, your Hocks increased, and your
subjects augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this
was before your wonderful deliverance on it, here is a vi-
sible prospect of its becoming a populous and well go-
verned kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory/'
There is no doubt to suppose but that the preceding re-
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no
less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who
heard it: nor were these people less pleased with those
necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the
knives, scissars, spades, shovels and pick-axes, with which
they now adorn their habitations.
So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work,
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians', who assisted
them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they
seemed at a distance as though they had lived like bees in
a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very in-
dustrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of bas-
ket work round the outside ; the walls were worked in as a
basket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in num-
ber, standing about seven feet high : in the middle was an-
other, not above twenty-two paces round, but much strong-
er built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight cor-
ners stood eight strong posts, round the top of which he
laid strong pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which
he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty* I assure
you, and joined very well together, with iron spikes whicb
he made himself; for he had made himself a forge, with
a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, form-
ing an anvil out of one of the iron crows, to work upon,
and in this manner would he make himself hooks, staples,
spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched the roof
of his innermost tent, he made it so firm between the raft-
ers with basket work, thatching that over again with rice-
straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that his house
was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. The outer cir-
cuit was covered as a le in-to, cpjite round this inner apart-
ment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the
top posts of the inner house, about twenty feet distant, so
that there was a space like a wall between the outer and in-
ner wail, near twenty feet in bread tin The inner place he
partitioned off with the same wicker work, dividing it mt&
s^c neat^artments, every one of which had a doory first
into the entry of the main tent, and another into the space
and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat,
bt.^for family necessaries. Within the door of the outer
circ-e, there was a passage directly to the door of the in-
ner house ; on either side was a wicker partition, and a
door, by wnich you go into a room twenty-two feet wide,
and alxmt thirty long, and through that into another of a
smaller .ength; so that in the outer circle were ten hand-
some r«..; us. six of which were only to be come at thro'
the apat*^ ? .ents of the inner tent, serving as retiring rooms
to the re -<«active chambers of the inner circle, and four
large wau nouses, which went in through one another,
two on eiti: i hand of the passage that led thro' the outer
door to the inner tent. In short, nothing could be built
mpre ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better conve-
niences; and here lived the three families, Will Atkins,
his companion, their wives and children, and the widow
of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught
their wives the knowledge of any thing more than the
sailor's custom of swearing by the name of God. The
greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught
them to speak English so as to be understood.
None of their children were then above six years old;
they were all fruitful enough ; and I think the cook's
mate's wife was big of her sixth child.
When I enquired of the Spaniards about their circum-
stances, while among the savages, they told me, that they
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a
poor and miserable people, that had no means put into
their hands, and* consequently must soon be starved to
death. They owned, however, that they were in the
wrong to think so, and for refusing the assistance that rea-
son offered for their support, as well as future deliver-
ance, confessing that grief was a most insignificant pas-
sion, as it looked upon things as without remedy, and hav-
ing no hope of things to come; all which verified this
noted proverb,
In trouble to be troubled,
1$ to have your trouble doubled.
Nor did his remarks end here; for, making observati-
ons upon my improvement, and upon my condition at first,
infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Englishmen
had} in their distress., greater presence of mind than those
of any other country that he had met with ; and that they
and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among
the savages, they found but liitic provision except the)
would turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and
herbs, with little substance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very sparingly. Many were the ways
they took to civilize and teach the savages, but in vain;
for they would not own them to be their instructors,
whose lives were owing to their bounty. Their extremi-
ties were very great, and many days being«eBtire]y with-
out food, the savages there being more indolent and less
devouring than those who had better supplies. When they
went out to battle they were obliged to assist these people,
in one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had like
to have been devoured. They had lost their ammunition,
which rendered their fire-arms useless ; nor could they use
the bows and arrows that were given them, so that white
the armies were at a distance, they had no chance, but
when close, then they could be of service with halberts,
and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their mus-
kets. They made themselves targets of wood, covered
with the skins of wild beasts; and when one happened to
be knocked down, the rest of the company fought over him
till he recovered ; and then standing close in a line, they
would make their way through # thousand savages. At the
return of their friend, who they thought had been entomb-
ed in the bowels of their enemies, their joy was inconceiv-
able. Nor were they less surprised at the sight of the
loaves of bread I had sent them, things that they had not
seen for several years, at the same time crossing and bless-
ing it, as though it was manna sent from Heaven \ but
when they knew the errand, and perceived the boat w&ch
was to carry them to the person and place from whence
such relief came, this struck them with such a surprise, of
joy as made some of them faint away, and others burst out
into tears.
This was the summary account that I had from them.
I shall now inform the reader what I next did for them, and
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion
that the savages would scarce trouble them any more*"so
we had no apprehensions on that score. I told them I w&s
come purely to establish, and not to remove them; and
upon that occasion, had not only brought diem neccessa-
ries for convenience and defence, but also artificers, and
other persons, both for their necessary employments, and
to add to their number. They were altogether when I
 thus talked to them; and before I delivered to them the
stores**! brought, I asked them one by one, if they had en-
tirely forgot their first animosities, would engage in the
strictest friendship, and shake hands with one another?
On this Will Atkins, with abundance of good humour, said
they had afflictions enough to make them all sober, and
enemies enough to make them all friends: as for himself,
he would rp^g|ind die among them, owning that what the
Spaniards Mt&donc to him, his own mad humour had made
necessary folk them to do. Nor had the Spaniards occa-
sion to justify their proceedings to me ; but they told me,
that since Will Atkins had behaved himself so valiantly in
fight, and at other times showed such a regard to the com-
mon interest of them ail, they had not only forgotten all
that was past, but thought he ought as much to be trusted
with arms'and necessaries as any of them, which they tes-
tified by making him next in command to the governor:
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving
me this solemn assurance, that they would never separate
their interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appoint-
ed all of us to dine together the next day; upon this I
caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore for
that purpose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought
from the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together
with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it; and in par-
ticular I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten
of English beer, which was very acceptable to them. The
Spaniards added to our feast, five whole kids, which being
roasted, three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sai-
lors on board, and the other two we ate ourselves. After
our merry and innocent feast was over, I began to distribute
my cargo among them. First I gave them linen sufficient
to make every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard's
request made them up six. The thin English stuffs I al-
lotted to make every one a light coat like a frock, agreea-
ble to the climate, and left them such a quantity as to make
more upon their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and
stockings. It is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfac-
tion which sat upon the countenances of these poor men,
when they perceived what care I took of them, as if I had
193
been a common father to them all ; and they all engaged
never to leave the island, till I gave my consent for their
departure. I then presented to them the people I brought,
viz. the taylor, smith, and two carpenters; but my Jack-
of*all-trades was the most acceptable present I could make
them. My taylor fell immediately to work, and made ev-
ery one of them a shirt; after which, he learned the wo-
men how to sew and stich, thereby to become the more
helpful to their husbands. Neither were the carpenters
less useful, taking in pieces their clumsy things; instead
of which they made convenient and handsome tables,
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers and shelves. But
when I carried them to see Will Atkins' basket-house, they
owned they never saw such a piece of natural ingenuity be-
fore; " I am sure," said one of the carpenters, " the man
"that built this has no need of us; you need, Sir, do no-
tl thing but give him tools '*
I divided the tools among them in this manner: to eve-
ry man I gave a digging spade, a shovel and a rake, as
having no harrows or plows; and to every separate place
a pick-axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with a store for a
general supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left
them also nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives,
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron work; and for the
use of the smith, gave them three tons of un wrought iron,
for a supply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored
them even to profusion; or at least, to equip a sufficient
little army against all opposers whatsoever.
The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starv-
ed to death) together with the maid, a pious and well edu-
cated young woman, seeing things so wcii ordered on shore
(for I made them accompany* me) and considering they
had'no occasion to go so far a voyage as the East Indies,
they both desired of me, that I would leave them therevi*nd
enter them among my subjects. This I readily agreed to,
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three little
houses erected, environed with basket-work, pallisadoed
like Atkins', and adjoining to his plantation. So contriv-
ed were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to
lodge in, while the middle tent was not only their store-
house, but their place for eating and drinking. At this
time the two Englishmen removed their habitations to their
"former place; so that now the island was divided into
thr&e colonies: first3 those I have just now mentioned j
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
secondly, that of Will Atkins, where there were four fam-
ilies of Englishmen, with their wives and children, the
widow and her children, the young man and the maid,
who, by the way, we made a wife of before our departure;
three savages who were slaves; the taylor, smith (who
served also as a gun-smith) and my other celebrated per-
son called J.ack-of-all-trades. Thirdly, my chief colony,
which consisted of the Spaniards, with old Friday, who still
remained at my old habitation, which was my capital city;
and surely nev^er.was there such a metropolis, it now being
hid in so obscure a grove, that a thousand men might have
ranged the island a month, and looked purposely for it,
without being able to find it, though the Spaniards had en-
larged its boundaries, both .without and within, in a most
surprising manner.
But now I think it high timje tp^speak of the young
French priest of the order of St;" Bre^?4i^t>vhpse judicious
and pious discourses, upon sundryvec^sions',! merit an ex-
traordinary observation; nor caji his -feem|^a 'French Pa-
pist priest,. I presume, give pffefic^to any of*my readers,
when they have, this assurance from me, that he was a per-
son of the most courteous disposition, extensive charity,
and exalted piety. His arguments were always agreeable
to reason, and his conversation the most acceptable of any
person that I ever yet met with in my life.
"Sir," said he, to me, one day, " since under God,'* at
the same time crossing his breast, " you have not only sa-
"ved my life; but, by permitting me to go this voyage,
£t have granted me the happiness of free conversation, I
u think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save
"what souls I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of
ft some Catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation ; and since
u these people are under your immediate government, in
"o-ratitucle, justice, and decency, for what you have done
fct for me, I shall offer no farther points in religion, than
"what shall merit your approbation." Being pleased with
the modesty of his carriage, I told him he •should not be
worse used for being of a different persuasion, if upon that
very account, we did not differ in points of faith, not decent
in a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to
be instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his
bon Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation
inin-ht easily be seperated from disputes; that he woti'^
discourse with me rather as a gentleman than a reli^^S:
but Uiat> if we did enter upon religious arguments,;-!
 
my desiring the same, I would give him liberty to defend
his own. principles. He farther added, that he would do all
that h#c£rne him in his office, as a priest as well as a Chris-
tian, to procure the happiness of all that were in the ship:
that though he could not pray with, he would pray for us,
on all occasions; and then he told me several extraordinary
events of his life, within a few years past; but particular-
ly the last which was the most remarkable ; that in this voy-
age, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and un-
shipped: his first design was to have gone to Martinico j
for which, taking ship at St. Malos, he was forced into
Lisbon by bad weather, the vessel running a-ground in the
mouth of the Tagus; that from thence he went on board
a Portuguese ship, bound to^the Madeiras, whose master
being but an indifferent mariner, and out of his reckoning,
they were drove to Fial, where selling their commodity*
which was corn, thej^esolved to take in their loading at
the Isle of May, arrfto "sail to Newfoundland; at the banks
of which, meeting with a French ship bound to Quebec^
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, in
this ship he embarked; the master of which dying at Que-
bec, that voyage was suspended; and lastly, shipping him-
self for France, this last ship was destroyed by fire,.as be-
fore has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another morn-
ing he comes to me, just as I was going to visit the En-
glishman's colony, and tells me, that as he knew the pros-
perity of the island was my principal desire, he had some-
thing to communicate agreeable to my design, by which
perhaps he might put it, more than he ye^ thought it was,
in the way of the benediction of Heaven. \" How, Sir?"
said I in a surprise, " are we not yet in the-way of God's
44 blessings, after all these signal providences and deliver-
11 ances, of which you have had such an ample relation V*
He replied, 44 I |£pe, Sir, you are in the way, and that
44 your good design will prosper: but still there are some
44 among you that are not equally right in their actions;
44 and remember, I beseech you, Sir, that Achan, by iris
44 crime, removed God's blessing from the camp of the
44 children of Israel; that though six and thirty were entire-
"ly innocent, yet they becama the objects of divine ven-
geance, and bore the weight of his punishment accord-
ingly."
So sensibly was I touc1 ed with this disburse, and'so sa*;
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflan^^ids soul, that I
 
desired him to accompany me to the Englishmen's plan-
tations, which he was very glad of, by reason they were
the subject of what he designed to discourse with me
about \t and while we'walked on together, he began in the
following manner,:
"Sir, said hevl must confess it as a great unhappiness
that we.clisagr.ee'in several doctrinal articles of religion;
but surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God,
who having gjv&n us some stated rules for our service and
obedience, we-ought not willingly and knowingly to offend
him; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian
owns,that when anyone presumptuously sins against God's
cott>mandvtlte Almighty they withdraws his blessing from
. him every geiod man therefore ought certainly to prevent
such neglect of, or sin against God and his commands." I
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a con-
cern for us, and desired him to explain Uie particulars of
what he had observed, that according to the parable of
Achan, I u might remove the accursed tiling from among
"us.'* Why.then, Sir, said he, in the first place, you have
four Englishmen, who have savage women to their wives,
b.y whom they have several children, though none of them
are legally married, as the law of God and man requires j
they, I say, Si^r, are no less than adulterers, and as they
still live in adultery, are liable to the curse of God. I know,
Sir, you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of
any kind; as also, pen-, ink, and paper, to write down a con-
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But
neither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you,
of their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage,
nor any more than an agreement to keep them from quar-
relling among themselves; for, Sir, the essence or sacra-
ment of matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in
mutual consent, but in the legal obligation, which compels
them to own and acknowledge one another, to abstain from
other persons, the men provide for their wives and chil-
dren, and the women to the same and like conditions, mu-
fatis mutandis, on their side: whereas, Sir, these men, up-
on their own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those
women, and marry others, and by disowning their children,
suffer them utterly to perish. "Now, Sir,'* added he,
"can God be honored in such an unlawful liberty as this •
"how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if i^efc
are allowed to live in so licentious a way?" I was indeed
struck with*the thing myself, and thought that they were
much to blame, that no formal contract had been made,
though it had been but breaking a stick between them,
to engage them to live as man and wife, never to separate,
but love, cherish, and comfort one another air their lives;
"yet, Sir," said T, u when they took these women, I was
not here, and if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I
cannot help it." "True, Sir," answered the young priest,
"you cannot be charged with that part of the crime which
was done in your absence: but I beseech you, don't flatter
yourself, that you are under no obligation now to put a
period to it; which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be
entirely on you alone, since it is certainly in nobody's pow-
er but yours, to alter their condition." I must confess, I
was so dull, that I thought he meant I should part them,
and knowing that this would put the whole island in con-
fusion, I told him I could not consent to it upon any ac-r
count whatsoever. u Sir," said he in a great surprise, " I"
do not mean that you should separate, but marry them, by
a written contract, signed by both man and woman, and by
all the witnesses present, which all the European laws de-
cree to be of sufficient efficacy." Amazed with such vali-
dity of a written contract, I acknowledged all that he said
to be very just and kind, and that I would discourse with
the men about it ; neither could I see what reason could
they have not to let him marry them, whose Authority in
that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they were marri-*
ed by any of our clergymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was this, that
though these English subjects of mine have lived with
these women seven years, and though they were of good-
understanding, and capable of instruction, having learned,
not only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while,
they had never taught them any thing of the Christian
religion, or the knowledge of God, much less in wlial
manner he ought to be served, "And is not this an un—
"accountable neglect"?" said he warmly. u Depend upon>
it, God Almighty will call them to account for such con—
tempt- And though I am not of your religion, yet L
should be glad to see these people released from the devil's
power, and be saved by the principles of the Christian rfe —
itigion, the knowledge of God, of a redeemer, the resur-*
reaion, and of a future state. But as it is not too late, i?£
•
you please to give me leave to instruct them, I doubt not
but I shall supply this great defect, by bringing them into
the great circle of Christianity, even while you continue
in the island."
I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him with
a thousand thanks, I would grant whatever he requested,
and desired him to proceed in the third article, which he
did in t,be following manner: /
Sir," said he, u it should be a maxim among all
Christians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propa-
gated by all possible means, and on all occasions. Upon
this account our church sends missionaries into Persia,
Ilklfa, arid'China, men who are willing to die for the sake
of»God and the Christian faith, in order to bring poor in-
fidels" into the -way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is
an opportunity to convert seven and thirty poor savages, I
wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of .doing
good, which is really worth the expence of a man's whole
life."
I must Confess I was so confounded at this discourse,
that I could not tell how to answer him. u Sir," said he,
seeing me.in- disorder, "I shall be very sorry if I have
"given you dffence." " No, Sir," said I, u I am rather con-
founded ; . and'you know my circumstances, that being
bound to'the East Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot
wrong the owners so much, as to detain the ship here, the
nien laying^ victuals and wages on their account. If I stay
above twelve clay ^. I must pay 3/. sterling fu r diem, dcniur-
rage,/nor nmsL 'the ship stop above eight days more; so
that Tarri unable to engage in this work, unless I would
lea^e the ship, and be reduced to my former condition."
The priest, though he owned this was hard upon me, yet
laid it to my conscience, whether the blessings of saving se-
ven and'thirty souls was not worth venturing all that I had
in the ftorld? u Sir," said I," it is very true ; but as you are
an ecclesiastic, it naturally falls into your profession ; why,
therefore, don't you rather offer to undertake it yourself*
than press me to it?" upon this he tin ned about, making
a very low bow, u I most humbly thank God and you, Sir,
(said he) for so blessed a call; and most willingly under-
take so glorious an office, which will sufficiently compen-
sate all the hazards and difficulties I have gone through
in a long and uncomfortable voyage."
While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture
in his face, by his colour going ajid coming; at th<e sajnas
,time his eyes sparkled like fire, and ail the signs of the
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether he
was in earnest ?" Sir," said he, "it was to preach to the
Indians I consented to come along with you ; these infidels
even in "this little island, are infinitely of more worth than
my poor life: if so that I should prove the happy instru-
ment of saving these poor creatures' souls, I care not if I
never see my native country again. One thing 1 only beg
of you more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to
be my interpreter, without whose assistance neither of us
will understand each other."
This request very sensibly troubled me ; first, upon Fri-
day's being bred a Protestant; and, secondly, for the af-
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: But, immediately
the remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head,
I recommended him to him as having learned Spanish,
which the priest also understood; and so was thoroughly
satisfied with him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after I had told them
what necessary things I had clone for them, I talked to them
of the scandalous life they led, told them what notice the
clergyman had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or bachelors ? They answered, two of them
were widowers, and the other three single men. But, said
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? They all said, that they took them before the
governor as such, having nobody else to marry them>
which they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson.
No doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so : but unless
1 am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these
poor creatures, I can.do nothing more for you, neither can
you expect God's blessing while you live in such an open-
course of adultery. Hereupon, Will Atkins, who spoke
for the rest, told me, That they believed their wives the
most innocent and virtuous creatures in the world; that
they Would never forsake them while they had breath ; and
that, if there was a clergyman in the ship, they would be
married to them with all their hearts. I told you before,
said I, that 1 have a minister with me, who sjhall marry
you to-morrow morning, if you are willing Vlffe * would
h^ve you consult to-night with the rest about it. ttold him
the clergyman was a Frenchman, and knew nota/^ojed of
J£j%Ush, but that I would act as a clerk between them.
indeed this business met with such speedy success, that
they all told me, in a few minutes after, that they were
ready to be formally married? as soon as I pleased; with
which informing the priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women should be
made sensible of the meaning of the thing ; with which be-
ing well satisfied, they with their husbands attended at my
apartment the next morning ; there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not baptised gave
them an exceeding reverence for his person : nor indeed
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told
them, That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the
sense of the laws of the society, they had lived in open adul-
tery, which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or
linal separation, could put an end to ; and even here was a
difficulty with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
in^tiarrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolator,
unbaptised ; but yet there was time enough to make them
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could
be done; that, besides, he believed themselves very indif-
ferent Christians; and consequently had not discoursed
with their wives upon that subject; and that unless they
promised him to do so, he could not marry them, as being
expressly forbidden by the laws of God.
. All this they heard attentively, and owned readily.
"But Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins, to me, " how
should we teach them religion, who know nothing of it
ourselves? How can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus
Christ, heaven and hell ? why they would only laugh at us,
who never yet have practised religion, but on the contrary
all manner of wickedness." "Will Atkins," said I, "can-
not you tell your wife she is in tne wrong, and that her gods
are idols, which can neither speak nor understand ; but that
our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that he
rewards the good and punishes the wicked ; and at last will
bring us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things?"
"That's true," saftl Atkins, u but then she'll tell-me it is
utterly false, since I am not punished and sent to the de-
T^fefwno hath been such a wicked creature*." These words
fg&Wpreted to the priest. "O!" said he, " tell him his
repentance will make him a very good minister to his
spouse, and qualify him to preach on the mercy and long
suffering of a merciful being, who desires not the death of
a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last judgment;
this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection, and
will make him an excellent preacher to his wife.'* I re-
peated this to Atkins, who being more than ordinarily af-
fected with it, replied, I know all this, Sir, and a great
deal more; but how can I have the impudence to talk
thus to my wife, when my conscience witnesses against
me r" u Alas I" said he (with tears in his eyes, and giving
a preat sigh) *fc as for repenting, that is forever past me/'
"Past you 1 Atkins," said I, u what do youjgiean ?" " You
"know well enough," said he, u what I mean; I mean it is
"too late."
When I told the priest what he said, the poor affection-
ate man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering
himself, u Pray, Sir," said he, ask him if he is contepted
that it is too late ; or is he concerned, and wishes it were
not so?" This question I put fairly to Atkins, who repli-
ed in a passion, u How can I be easy in a state which I
"know must terminate in my ruin? for I really believe
"some time or other I shall cut my throat, to put a period
"both to my life, and to the terrors of my conscience."
At this, the clergyman shook his head, " Sir," said he*
"pray tell him it is not too late; Christ will give him re-
pentance, if he has recourse to the merits of his passion.
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy?
There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will
no longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in
this world." 1 told Atkins every word the priest had said*
who then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we
discoursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in
religious matters: yet all of them promised to do their en-
deavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon
which promises, the priest married the three couple. But
as Atkins was the only sincere convert, and of more seiise
than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly enquiring-g£»
ter him : " Sir," said he, u let us walk out of this labyrinth,
and T dare say we shall find this poor man preaching
his wife already." And indeed we found it true, for c^iii*
ing to the edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins an&^is
savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, m very ear*
nest discourse j he pointed to the sun, to die quarters^
the earth, to himself, to her, the Woods and the trees. Im-
mediately we could perceive him start upon his feet, fall
down upon his knees, and lift up both his hands ; at which
the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our
great misfortune was, we could not hear,one word that
passed between them. Another time he would embrace
her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing her with the
greatest transports, and then both kneel down for some
minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this occasion
in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain him-
self: and a little after this, we observed by her motion, as
frequently lifting up her hands, and laying them on her
breast, that she was mightily affected with his discourse,
and so they withdrew from our sight.
When we came back, we found them both waiting to
be called in ; upon which he agreed to examine him alone,
and so 1 began to discourse him thus. "Prithee, Will At-
"kins," said I, "what education have you? What was
"your father?"
'W. A. A better man than ever I shall be; he was, Sir,
a clergyman, who gave me good instruction, or correction,
which I despised, like a brute as I was, and murdered my
poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer.
(Here the Priest atartedy and looked fialey thinking he had
really killed his fat her. J
R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his heart
by the most unnatural turn of disobedience to the tender-
est and. best of fathers.
R. C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did
not ask you to extort a confession; but I asked you be-
cause I see you have more knowledge of what is good than
your companions.
W. A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life,
conscience upbraids mc with my father; the sins against
our parents, make the deepest wounds, and their weight
lies the heaviest upon the mind.
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly forme *
I am not able to bear it.
W. A. You bear it Sir! you know nothing of it.
R.. C. But yes, Atkins, I do ; and every shore, valleys .
and tree in this island witness the anguish of my scnjl for*^
my undutifulness to my kind father, whom I have murdei^
eel likewise; yet my repentance falls infinitely short of
your's. But Will, how comes the sense of this n^attel* to
touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa-
sioned it; for talking to my wile about God and religion,
she has preached me such a sermon, that I shall retain it
in lasting remembrance.
R. C. No, no, it is your own pious arguments to her,
has made conscience fling them back upon you. But pray
Atkins, inform us what passed between you and your wife,
and how did you begin?
W. A. I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the rea-
son of such compacts, whereby order and justice is main-
tained; without which men would run from their wives
and children, to the dissolution of their families or inherit-
ances.
R. C. Well, and what did she say to all this?
W. A. Sir, we began our discourse in the following
manner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my
mean capacity, if you think it worth your while to honor
it with your attention.
THE
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
WILL ATKIXS AXD HIS WIPE,
IN THE WOOD.
Wife. YOU tell me marriage God appoint, have you
God in your country?
W. A> Yes, child, God is in every nation.
Wife. No ; great old Benamuckec God is in my country
not yours.
W. J. My dear, God is in heaven, which he made j he
also made the earth, the sea, and all that is therein.
v\ Wife. Why you not tell me much long ago?
W. A. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, having?
a long time lived without the knowledge of God in the
world.''
Wifk. What, not know great God in own nation? No
3o good ting ? No say O to him? that's strange? .
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was no God
in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suffer them? why not makee live well?
W. A. It is our own faults, child.
Wife. But if he is much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no serve him? No be good mans no cry
O to him?
W. A. That's true my dear, he may strike us dead, but
his abundant mercy spareth us.
Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for that?
TV. A. No, I have neither thanked him for his mercy,
nor feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God to be good, nor
makee kill, when you makee him angry.
W. A. Alas must my wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in him?
Wife. How can me link your God live there? (fioiniing
to heaven) Sure he no ken what you do here.
W. A. Yes my dear, he hears us speak, sees what we
do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power strong, when he hears
you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My dear, this shows indeed he is a God and not
a man, who has such tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy ! what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and spares us: as he is our great Cre-
ator, so he is also our tender Father.
Wife. So God never angry, never kill wicked, then he
no good, no great mighty.
W. A. O my dear, don't say so, he is both ; and many
times he shows terrible examples of his judgment and ven-
geance.
Wife. Then you makee de bargain with him ;vyou do
bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt.other mans.
W* A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness.
Wife. Well, and yet no makee you dead ; and you give
him no tankee neither?
W. A* It is true, I am an ungrateful, unthankful dog?
that I am. •
Wife. Why, you say, he makee you, why makee you
no much better then?  * *
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myself, and
abuscdjus goodness.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no raakee him
angry, no do bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you desire I would
teach you to know God : alas! poor dear creature, he
must teach thee, and not I. But Til pray earnestly to him
to direct thee, and to forgive me, a miserable sinner.
(Hereupon he went a little distance, and kneeling down,
prayed earnestly to God to enlighten her mind, ancfto .
pardon his sins; when this was done, they continued
their discourse thus.)
Wife. What you put down knee for? For what hold
up hand? Who you speak to?
W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him
that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes
and understanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? And will he hear what
you say?
W. A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given us
promise that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray ? What 1 do you
hear him speak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to
good men from heaven : and by divine revelation they
have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. O where that good book?
W. A. I have it not now by me, but one time or other,
I shall get u for you to* read. Then he embraced her
with great affection.
Wife. Pray tell a mee, did God teachee them write
that book?
W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be God,:
Wife. What way, what rule you know him? ?f
W. A. Because he teaches what is good, just, and holy \
and forbids all wicked and abominable actions that incur
his displeasure.
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things
you say he do, surely he hear me say O to him; he make
me good "if I wish to be good; he no kill me if I love him;
me tmk, believe him great God; me say O to him, along
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her
kneel down by him, praying with the greatest fervency,
that God would instruct her by his Holy Spirit; and that
God by his providence would send them a Bible for both
their instructions. And such was the early piety of this
new convert, that she made him promise never to forsake
God any more, lest being made chad, as she called it, she
should not only want her instructor, but himself be mis-
erable in along eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af-
fecting to us both, but particularly to the young clergyman,
who was mightily concerned he could not talk to her him-
self. u Sir," said he, " there is something more to be
"done to this woman than to marry her: 1 mean that she
"ought to be baptised." To this I readily agreed : " Pray,"
Said he, u ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to
"her of Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature
"of faith, and rcdeu ption in and by him, of the Holy Spi-
a rit, the resurrection, last judgment, and a future state
but the poor.fellow melted into tears at this question, say-
ing, that he had said something to her of these things, but
his inability to talk of them, made him afraid, lest her
knowledge of them should rather make her contemn re-
ligion, than be benefited by it; but that ifl would discourse
with her, it would be very evident my labour would not be
in vain. Accordingly I called her in, and placing-myself
as interpreter between the religious priest and the woman,
I entreated him to go on; but surely never was such a
sermon preached by any clergyman in these latter days,
with so much zeal, knowledge, •and sincerity; in short,
he brought the woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ,
and of redemption by him, with so surprising a degree of
understanding, that she made it her own request to be
baptised.
He then performed his office in the sacrament of bap-
tism, first, by saying some words over to himself in latin,
and then asking me to give her a name, as being her god-
father, and pouring a whole dish-full of water upon the
woman's head, he said, " Maryy I baptise thee in the name
"of the Father, and of the -on, and of the Holy Ghost
so that none could know of what religion he was. After
this, he pronounced the benediction in latin. Thus the
woman being made a Christian, he married her to Will
Atkins; which being finished, he affectionately exhorted
him to lead a holy life for the future; and since the Al-
mighty, for the convictions of his conscience, had honor-
ed him to be the instrument of his wife's conversion, he
should not dishonor the grace of God, that while the sav •
age was converted, the instrument should be cast away.
This ended a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and
agreeable I ever passed in my life. ^:
The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing
to go on board, when the young man (whose mother was
starved) came to me, saying, that as he understood I had
a clergyman with me, who had married the Englishmen
with savages, he had a match to make between two Chris-
tians, which he desired might be finished before I depart-
ed. Thinking it was he himself that had courted his
mother's maid, I persuaded him not do to any thing rash-
ly upon the account of his solitary circumstances; that the
maid was an unequal match for him, both in respect to
substance and years; and that it was very probable he
would live to return to his own country, where he migut
have afar better choice. At these words, smiling, he in-
terrupted me, thanking me for my good advice ; that as
he had nothing to beg of me but a small settlement, with a
servant 6? two, or some new necessaries, so he hoped I
would not be unmindful of him when I returned to En-
gland, but give his letter to his friends; and that when he
was redeemed, the plantation, and ail its improvements,
however Valuable, should be returned to me again. But
as for the marriage he proposed, that it was not himself,
but that it was between my Jack-of-all-trades and the maid
Susan*
I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this
match, which seemed very suitably the one being a very
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dextrous, and
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island;
so we married them the same day; and as I was her fa-
ther, and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome por-
tion, appointing her and her husband a convenient large
space of ground for their plantation. The sharing out of
the land I left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very
justly, to every person's satisfaction; they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I
caused to be drawn up, signed and sealed to them> Set*
ting out their bounds, and giving them a right to the whole
possession of their respective plantations, with their im-
provements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest
of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for
every particular plantation, after eleven years. As to their
kws and government, I exhorted them to love one and
ther; and as to the Indians who lived in a nook by them-
selves, I allotted iiiree or four of them plantations, and
the rest willingly chose to become servants to the other
fiuT>iiies, by which means they were employed in useful
labour, and fared much better than they did before. Be-
sides the savages being thus mixed with the Christians,
the work of their, conversion might be set on foot by the
latter, in the clergyman's absence, to our equal satisfac-
tion. The young priest, however, was a little anxious lest
the Christians should not be willing to do their parts in in-
structing these poor Indians; I therefore told him we
should call them all together; that he should speak to the
Spaniards who were Papists, and I to the English, who
were Protestants, and to make them promise that they
would never make any distinction in religion, but teach
the general true knowledge of God, and his Son Jesus
Christ, in order to convert the poor savages. And this,
indeed, they ail promised us accordingly.
When I came to Will Atkins' house, I found his bap-
tised wife, and the young woman newly married to my'
Jack-of-all-trades, were become great intimates, and dis-
coursing of religion together. "0,Sir," says Will Atkins,
44 when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, he never
wants an instructor; I knew I was xwworthy of so good a
work, and therefore this young woman lias been sent hi-
ther as it were from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a
whole nation of savages." The young woman blushed, and
was going to rise, but I desired her to sit still, and hoped
that God would bless her in so good a work; and then
pulling out a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my
pocket for him.) ik Here Atkins," said I, "here is an as-
44 sistam that perhaps you had not before." So confounded
was the poor man, that it was some time before he could
speak ; at last, turning to his wife, 44 My dear,*' he said,
"did I not tell you that God could hear what we said?
Here's the book I prayed for, when you and I kneeled un-
der the bush: God then heard us, and now has sent it."
The woman was surprised,and thought really God had sent
that individual book from heaven ; but I turned to the young
woman, and desired her to explain to the young convert,
that God may properly be said to answer our petitions,
when,in the course of his providence,such particular things
came to pass as we petitioned for. This the young woman .
did effectually; but surely Will Atkins' joy^nnot be^ex^
pressed; no man being more thankful lor any thing in the
world, than he was for his Bible, nor desired it from a bet-
ter principle.
After several religious discourses, I desired the young
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when
.she was starving to death with hunger; to which she rea-
dily consented, and began in the following manner:
"Sir," said she, "all our victuals being' gone, after I
had fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at
the approach of night, I was inclined to yawning and
sleepy. When I slept upon the couch three hours, I
awaked a little refreshed: three hours after, my stomach
being more and more sickly, i lay down again but could
not sleep, being j/ery. faint and ill. Thus I passed the se-
cond day with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick
again, with Teachings to vomit; that night I dreamed I
was ^J8a,rbadoes, buying plenty of provisions, and dined
heaitif£> but when I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly
suok'torpid myself in the extremity of famine. There-
was but &ie glass of wine, which being mixed with sugar,
I drank up; but for want of substance to digest upon, the
fumes of it got into my head, and made me senseless for
some time. The third day I was so ravenous and furious
that I could have eaten a little child if it had come in my
way ; dttving which time I was as mad as any creature in
Bedlam.- In one of these fits I fell down, and struck my
face agaitsst the corner of a^pallet bed where my mistress
lay ; this blood gushed out of my nose, but by my exces-
sive bleeding, both the violence of the fever, and the ra-
venous part of the hunger abated. After this, I grew sick
again, strove to vomit, but could not; then bleeding a se-
cond time, I swooned away as dead j when I came to my*
self, 1 h*ad a dreadful gnawing pain in my stomach, which
went off towards pight, with a longing desire for food.
I took a draught of water and sugar, but it came up again;
then I drank wa^er without sugar, and that staid with me,
I laid me down on the bed, praying God would take me
away; after I had slumbered, I thought myself a-dykig>
therefore recommended my soul to God, and wished some-
body would throw me into the sea. All this wfsile my de~
parting mistress lay by me ; the last bit of bread she had
she gave to her dear child, my young master. The mors-
ing alter, I fell into a violent fit of crying, and after-that
into hunger. I espied the blood that came from tare jaas^
 
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
in a bason, which I immediately sw^l{,owed up. At night
I had ,the usual variations, as the'pain in the stomach,
sjjsk', sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought but I
should die before morning. In the morning came on ter-
rible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my
young master's lamentations, by which I understood his
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, "a
"sail ! a sail!" hallooing as if they were distracted for
joy of that relief, which afterwards we received from your
hands."
Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to
death than this. But to return to the disposition pfthings
among my people, I did not take any notice to them-of
'the sloop I had framed, neither would IJeave &|h'the,
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quacter^ckvg^s.'-
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust^K'tiiey Sfcdulfr.
have separated, or turned pirates, and so made the islaT?-i:
a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober, pious puo-
, pie: but leaving them in a flourishing condrtfof^ mtl|i.
jpromise to send them further relief from Brazili&SslteepV
hogs, and cows (being obliged to kill them-atscai bsSVingf"
no hay to feed them) I went on board the ship pgah-^ "the
first of May, 1685, after having been twenty day* -Among
them; and next morning, giving them a salute of fives,
guns at parting, we set sail for the Brazils." Tile third
day, towards evening, there happening a caittts/Upd the«
current being very strong, we were drove to the:J\T; JNT. E.
towards the land. Some hours after, jwe perceivetRbe sea
covered as it were with something very black,* i^^sily
at first to be discovered: upon .'which our chiefejpap*as-
scending the shrouds a little %vuy, and taking a^^ith
^ perspective glass, he erica out, " an army! an$?|j& W
"You fool," said I, " what do you mean?" " Nay^1f|r,"'
said he "don't be artgf> 1 assure you it is not only m
".army, but a fleet toi> fv>i i believe there are a thousand
*< canoes paddling aloni;, and making with great haste to-
"ward* us."
Indeed ever nne of us were surprised at this relation;
"and my neph<,\ he captain could not tell what to think of
it, but thougUi weshould all be devoured. Nor was!
free f<' -n concern, when I considered how much vve.w.e^e
fieca' < . ([} and what a strong current set towards the^h-ore-f
how- • • 'encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring til ft
shi p - u anchor, as soon as we were certain that m naft^
engage them. Accor^gly, we did so, and furled all our
sails; as to the savagelrwe feared nothing, but only that
they might set the ship on fire; to prevent which I order-
eel them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the head and the other by the stern, well manned, with
skeets and buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so
happen. The savages soon came up with us, but there
were not so many as the mate had said, for instead of a
thousand canoes, there were only one hundred and twen-
ty; too many indeed for us, several of their canoes con-
taining about sixteen or seventeen men.
As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great-
est amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They
rowed rounrf the^hip, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats, not to suffer them to come near them.-
Ifeteupoa they beckoned to the savages to keep back,
which ciiey accordingly did, but at the moment of their
retreat,' >et-fiy"about-fifty arrows among us, and very much
wounJrii ^ne of our men in the long-boat. I called to them
)iot tui c upon any account, but handing them down some ,
deal b- 1 ihv. carpenters made them a kind of fence to
simile ,71 from the arrows. In half an hour after, they
'cnm<: is- ar astern of us, that we had a perfect sight of
thriv. Vict they rowed a little farther out, till they caftfte
di?vr aio!:; .trie of us, and then approached so near,
ihat lUey couki hear us speak: this made me order all our
men to keep close, and get their guns ready. In the mean
time I ordered Friday to go out upon deck, and ask them
in his language what they meant. No sooner did he do so,
but six of the savages who were in the foremost canoes,
stooping down, showed us their naked backsides, as much
as to say in English, Kiss our :but Friday quickly
knew what this meant, by immediately crying out'tfaey"
were %©ing to shoot; unfortunately for him, poor crea-
ture, who fell under the cloud of three hundred arrows,
no less than seven piercing through his body, killing one
of the best servants, and faithfullest of companions in all
any solitudes and afflictions. ,
So engaged was I at tjie death of poor Fr.day, that the
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot;
nor did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside
split and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming: the
others, frightened oui <>i tj){dr^^^ttie regarding their
fellows drowning, scout ed awa^lraft as they could. One
poor wretch our people took up, swimmh.g for his life, an
hour after- He v$fegyery sullen at first, so.that he would
neither eat nor speak: but I took a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the sea* which they did*
and then he came swimming back like a cork, calling in
his tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we took him on
board, but it was a long time before we could make him
speak, or understand English; yet when wc had taught
him, he told us they were going with their kings to fight
a great battle ; and when we asked him what made them
come up to us, he said, u to makee de great wonder look
where it is to be noted, that those natives,...$nd.those of
Africa, always add two e's at the end orEngliih-,rWQrds,
as makee^ takee^ and the like, from which it is a, very, diffi-
cult thing to make them break off. J
Being now under sail, we took our last fare*#«TI|>fpoor
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible jfecency
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin, aiuf -&fhmining
him to the deep, at the same time causing elevert girns to
be fired. Thus ended the life of one of the most affection-
ate, honest and faithful servants that ever any ia fea
blessed with.
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days
time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days we
came up to an anchor in the Bay of All Saints. 1 had
great difficulty here to get leave to hold a correspondence
on shore; for neither the figure of my partner, my two
merchant trustees, nor the fame of my wonderful preser-
vation, in the island, could procure me the favor, till such
time as the prior of the monastery of St. Augustine (to
whom I had given 500 moidores) obtained leave from the
Governor, for me personally, with the Captain and one
more, together with eight sailors, to come on shore; upon
this condition, that we should not land any goods out of
the ship, nor carry away any person without licence: I
found means, however, to get on shore three bales of En-
glish goods, such as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some
linen, which I brought as a present for my partner, who
had sent me on board a present of fresh provisions* wine*
and sweet-meats, worth about thirty moidores, i»rf$4t$S£
some tobacco, and three or four fine gold medals.
 
Here I delivered x&% partner in goods to the value of
1001. sterling, and I obliged him to fit up the sloop I bought
for the use of my island, in order to send them refresh-
ments; and so active was he in this matter, that he had
the vessel finished in a few days, to the master of which I
gave particular instructions to find the place. I soon load-
ed him with a small cargo; and one of our sailors offered
to settle there, upon my letter to the panish governor, if
I would allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly
granted, and gave him the savage we had taken prisoner,
to be his slave. All things being ready for the voyage,
my old partner told me there was an acquaintance of his,
a Brazil planter, who having fallen under the displeasure
of the church, and in fear of trie Inquisition, which oblig-
ed him to be concealed, would be glad of such an oppor-
tunityto make his escape, with his wife and two daugh-
ters ; and if I would allot them a plantation in my island,
he would give them a small stock to begin with* for that
the officers had already seized his effects and estate, and
left him nothing but a little household stuff and two slaves.
This request I presently granted, concealing him and his
family on board our ship, till such time as the sloop (where
. all the effects were) was gone out of the bay, and then we
put them on board, who carried some materials, and plants
for planting sugar-canes, along with them. By this sloop
among other things, -I.sent my subjects three milch cows
and five calves, about 22 hogs, three sows big with pig,
two mares and a stone horse. I also engaged three Port*
ugal women to go for the sake of the Spaniards, which,
with the persecuted man's two daughters, were suffic iemV
since the rest had wives of their own, though in another
country; all which cargo arrived safe, no doubt to theifc
exceeding comfort, who, with this addition, were about
sixty or seventy people, besides children.
At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left
me; for a ship being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he ask-
ed me leave to go thither; but I assure you, it was with
the greatest reluctance I parted from a person, whose
virtue and piety merited the greatest esteem.
From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a^to^^pl^
good voyage, steering for the most part S. E. W^^exe
mx a-trading voyage, and had a supercargo on boar^^fe
was to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived
 
Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days, for
stay, by charter party, at the several ports she was to go
to. At the Cape we only took in fresh water, and then
sailed for the coast of Coromandel; we were there inform-
ed, that a French man of war of 50 guns, and two large
merchant ships, were sailed for the Indies, but we heard
no more of them.
In our passage, we touched at the island of Madagas-
car, where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and
treacherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lan-
ces, yet for some time they treated us civilly enough ; and,
in exchange for knives, scissars, and other trifles, they
brought us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took part-
ly for present victuals, and the remainder to salt for the
ship's use.
So curious was I to view every corner of the World
where I came to, that I went on shore as often as I could.
One evening when on shore, we observed numbers of the
people stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought our-
selves in no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly.
However, we cut three boughs out of a tree", sticking
them at a distance from us, which it seems, in that coun-
try, is not only a token of truce and amity, but when
poles or boughs are set up on the other side, it is a sign
the truce is accepted. In these treaties, however, there is
one principal thing to be regarded, that neither party come
beyond one another's three poles or boughs; so that the
middle space is not only secure, but is also allowed as a
market for traffic and commerce. When the truce is thus
accepted, they stick up their javelins and lances at the first
poles, and then the truce is at an end. This evening it
happened that a greater number of people than usual, both
men and women, traded among us for such toys as we
had, with such great civility, that we made us a little tent
of large boughs of trees, some of the men resolving to lie
on shore all night; but, for my part, I and some others
took our lodging in the boat, with boughs of trees spread
over it, lYuving a sail spread at the bottom to lie upon.
About two o'clock in the morning we were awakened by
the firing of muskets, and our men crying out for help, or
else tliey would ail be murdered. Scarce had we time to
get the boat ashore, when our men came plunging them-
selves into the water, with about four hundred of the
islanders at their heels. We took up seven of the men*
three of them very much wounded, and one left behind
killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so thick
among us, that we were forced to make a barricado, with
boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from dan-
ger; and, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned
them a volley, which wounded several of them, as we could
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of
day, and then making signals of distress to the ship, which
my nephew the captain heard and understood, he weighed
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then
sent another boat with ten hands in her to ^assist us; but
we called to them not to come near, informing them of
our unhappy condition. However they ventured; when
one of the men taking the end of a tow-iine in one hand,
and keeping our boat between him and our adversaries,
swam to us, and slipping our cables, they towed us ouu* f
reach of their arrows, and quickly after a broad-side was
given them from the ship, which made a most dreadful
havoc among them. When we got on board, we exam-
ined into the occasion of this fray. The men who fled in*
formed us, that an old woman, who sold milk within the
poles, had brought a young woman with her, who carried
roots or herbs, the sight of whom so much tempted our
men, that they offered rudeness to the maid, at which the
old woman set up a great cry; nor would the sailors part
with the prize, but carried her among the trees, while the
old woman went, and brought a whole army down upon
them. At the beginning of the attack, one of our men
was killed with a lance, and the fellow who began the mis-
chief, paid dear enough for his mistress, though as yet we
did not know what had become of him; the rest luckily
escaped. The third night after the action, being curious
to understand how affairs stood, I took the supercargo and
twenty stout fellows with me, and landed about two hours
before midnight, at the same place where those Indians
stood the night before, and there we divided our men into
two bodies, the boatswain commanding one, and I another.
It was so dark, that we could see nobody, neither did we
hear any voice near us: but by and by the boatswain fall--
ing over a dead body, we agreed to halt till the moorif
should rise, which we knew would be in an hour after*?
We perceived here no fewer than two and thirty bodies-
upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Sat-
isfied with this discovery, I was for going on board again-;'
but the boatswain and the rest told me, they would make
a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, so* they call-
ed them, resided, asking me at the same time to go along
with them; for they did not doubt, besides getting a boo-
ty, but they should find Tom JefVery there, for that was
the unhappy man we missed. But I utterly refused to go,
and commanded them back, being unwilling to hazard
their lives, as the safety of the ship wholly depended upon
them. Notwithstanding all I could say to them, they all
left me but one, and the supercargo; so we three return-
ed to the boat, where a boy was left, resolving to stay till
they returned. At parting I told them I supposed most
of them would run the same fate with Tom Jeffery. To
this they replied, u Come bo/ys, come along, we'll warrant
"we'll come off safe enough and so away they went, not-
withstanding all my admonitions, either concerning their
own safety or the preservation of the ship. Indeed^ they
were gallantly armed, every man haviftg a musket, bayo-
net, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers, pole-axes and
hand granades. They came to a few Indian houses at
first, which not being the town they expected, they went
farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they concluded
that she would be a sufficient guide, and so it proved; for,
after they untied her, she led them directly to the town,
which consisted of about two hundred houses, several fa-
milies living in some of the huts together. At their arri-
val, all being in-a piofound sleep, the sailors agreed todi-
vide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts of
the town on fire at once, to kill those that were escaping,
and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus desperately re-
solved, they went to work; but the first party had not
gone far, before they called out to the rest, that they had
found Tom Jeflery; whereupon they all ran up to the
place, and found the poor fellow indeed hanging up na-
ked, by one arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear.
In a house that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen
or seventeen Indians, who had been concerned in the fray,
two or three of them being wounded, were not gone to
sleep: this house they set on fire first, and in a few min-
utes after, five or six places more in the town appeared in
flames. The conflagration spread like wild-fire, their hous-
es being all of wood, and covered with flags or rushes.
The poor affrighted inhabitants endeavoured to inn out to
save their lives, but they were driven back into the fiarn^.
by the sailors, and killed without mercy. At the first
house above mentioned, after the boatswain had slain two
with his pole-ax, he threw a hand-granado into the house,
which bursting, made a terrible havoc, killing and wound-
ing most of them; and their king and most of his train-
who were then in that house, fell victims to their fury, ev-
ery creature of them being either smothered or burnt.
All this while they never fired a gun, lest the people should
awaken faster, than they could overpower them. But the
fire awakened them fast enough, which obliged our fellows
to keep together in bodies. By this time the whole town
was in a flame, yet their fury rather increased, calling out
to one another to remember Tom Jeffery. The terrible
light of this conflagration made me very uneasy, and rous-
ed my nephew, the Captain, and the rest of his men, who
knew nothing of the matter. When he perceived the
dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go off, he readily con-
cluded his men were in danger; he therefore takes ano-
ther boat, and comes ashore himself, with thirteen men
well armed. He was greatly surprised to see me and only
two men in the boat, but more so when I told him the
story; but though I argued with him, as I did with the
men, about the danger of the voyage, the interests of the
merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet my
nephew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather lose
the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should
be lost for want of help; and so away he went. For my
part, seeing him resolved to go, I had not power to stay
behind. He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve
men more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But surely never was such a scene cf horror
beheld, or morexlismal cries heard, except when Oliver
Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither
spared man, woman, nor child.
The first object, 1 think, we met with, was the ruins of
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and*,
three women killed, and two more burnt to death among
the fire, which was now decaying. Nothing could appear
more barbarous than this revenge ; nor more cruel than
the authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and
the cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much
farther, when we beheld three naked women, followed bv
sixteen or seventeen men, flying with the greatest swift-
ness* from our men, who shot one of them in our sight.
When they perceived us, whom they supposed also their
in u roe re is, they set up a most dreadful shriek, and both of
them swooned away in the fright. This was a sight which
frnight have softened the hardest heart; and in pity we
took some ways to let them know we would not hurt them,
while the poor creatures with bended knees, and lifted up
hands, made piteous lamentations to us to save their lives.
I ordered our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures
whatsoever; but being willing to understand the occasion
of all this, I went among these unhappy wretches, who
neither understood me, nor the good I meant them. How-
ever, being resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I or-
dered the men to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards
before we came up with the boatswain, with four of our
in&n at his heels, all of them covered with" blood and dust,
and in search of more people to satiate their vengeance.
As soon as we saw them, we called out, and made them
understand who we were; upon which they came up to us,
setting up a halloo of triumph, in token that more help
was come. "Noble Captain," said he to my nephew,u I'm
glad you're come: we have not half clone with these vil-
lainous hell-hound dogs; we'll root out the very nation of
them from the earth, and kill more than poor Tom has
hairs upon his head and thus he went on till I interrupt-
64 ed him'.—'1 Blood-thirsty dog," said I, u w ill your cruelty
66 r»ever end? I charge you touch not one creature more;
u stop your hands, and stand still, or yoif^re a dead man
*c this moment." " Why Sir," said he, " you neither know
"whom you are protecting, nor what they have done : but
c< pray come hither, and behold an instance of compassion,
"if such can merit your clemency;" and with that he
showed me the poor fellow with his throa*t cut, hanging
xipon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage,
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agreeable to
these words of Jacob to his sons Simeon and Levi : " Cur-
sed be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for
it was^cruel." But this sight made my nephew and the
resta&'bad as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con-
cern was only for his men; as for the people, not a soul
of them- ought to live. Upon this, the boatswain and eight
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended
tragedy ; which being out of my power to prevent, I return-
ed back from the, dismal sight, and the piteous cries of fhe
unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to their fu-
ry. Indeed it was an egregious folly in me to return to the
boat with.but one attendant, and I had very near paid for
it, having narrowly escaped forty armed Indians, who had
been alarmed by the conflagration; but passing the place
where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied by the
supercargo, and so went on board, sending the pinnace
back again, to assist the men in what might happen.
When I had got to the boat, the fire was almost extinguish-
ed, and the noise abated; but I had scarce been half an
hour on board the ship, when I heard another volley giv-
en by our sailors, and a great smoke, which, as I found
afterwards, was our men falling upon those houses and
persons that stood between them and the sea; but here
they spared the wives and children, and killed only men,
to the number of sixteen or seventeen. By the time they
got to the shore, the pinnace and ship's boat were ready to
receive them, and they all got safe on board, not a man
of them having received the least hurt, except two, one of
whom strained his foot, and the other burnt his hand a lit-
tle; for they met with no resistance, the poor Indians be-
ing unprepared, amazed and confounded. • .;i;<l-4l
I was extremely angry with every one of themV^t$£p£i!'~
ticularly with the Captain, who instead of coolingthe rage
of the men, had prompted them on to further mischief:
nor could he make me any other excuse, but that as he
was a man, he could not master his passions at the sight
of one of his men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest*
knowing they were not under my command, they took no
notice of any anger, but rather boasted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed
about 150 men, women and children, besides burning the
town to ashes. They took their companion Tom Jeffery
from the tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and
so left him. But, however this action of tfur men might
seem to them justifiable, yet I always openly condemned
it with the appellation of the massacre of Madagascar.
For tho* the natives had slain this Jeffery, yet certainly lie
was the first aggressor, by attempting to violate the chas-
tity of a young innocent woman, who had ventured down
to them, on the fakh.of a public capitulation, which wa*
so treacherously broken. _ ,
While we were under saii, the boatswain would often
defend tn|s bloody action, by saying, that the Indians had
broke the truce the night before, by shooting one of our
men without just provocation: and what if the poor fellow
had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to
have been murdered in so villainous a manner: and that
they had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis-
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in
the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur-
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast
their voyage, for such an unparallelled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Guiph of Persia, five of our men
who ventured on shore were either killed or made slaves
by the Arabians, the rest of them" having scarce time to
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresh
with the just retribution of Heaven for such actions; upon
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, u Whether
those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell were greater
sinneis than the rest of the Galiieans ? and besides, Sir,"
said he, " none of these five poor men that are lost, were
"with us at the massacre of Madagascar, as you call it,
and therefore your representation is very unjust, and you?
application improper. Besides," added h e, you are con**
tinually using the men very ill upon this account, and
being but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear
it; nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to
bring us to judgment for it in England ; and therefore, if
you do not leave this discourse, as also not concern your-
self with any of our a flairs, I will leave the ship, and not
sail among such dangerous company."
All this I heard very patiently ; but, it being often re-
peated, I at length told him the concern I had on board
was none of his business: that I was a considerable owner
In the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in common,
and that I was no ways accountable to him, nor to any bo-
dy else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought
all had been over. At this time we were in the road of
Bengal, where going on shore with the supercargo one day,
in the evening as I was preparing to go on board, one of the
men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble myself
to come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others
had ordered him not to carry me on board any more.
This insolent message much surprised me ; yet I gave
him no answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the
supercargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by ac-
quainting the Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which f
perceived would happen. But before I had spoken this,
the matter was effected on board; for no sooner was he
gone off in the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter,
and all the inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck, de-
siring to speak with the Captain \. and there the boatswain
made a long harangue, exclaiming against me, as before
mentioned, that, if I had not gone an shore peaceably, for
my own diversion, they by violence would have compelled
me, for their satisfaction: thafas they had shipped with
the Captain, so they would faithfully serve him ; but if I
did not quit the ship, or the Captain oblige me to it, they
would leave the ship immediately: hereupon, turning his
face about, by way of signal, they ail cried out, " one ande
"ALL ! ONE AND ALL !*'
You may be sure, that though my nephew was a man
of great courage, yet he could not but be surprised at their
sudden and unexpected behaviour; and though he talked
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them,
that in common justice to me, who was a considerable
owner in the ship, they could not turn me as it were out of
my own house, which might bring their lives in danger,
should they ever be taken in England; nay, though he
invited the boatswain on shore to accommodate matters
with me; yet all this I say signified nothing; they would
have nothing to do with me; and they jvere resolved to go
on shore if i came on board. 44 Well," said my nephew*
"if you are so resolved, permit me to talk with hkn, and
then I have done and so he came to me, giving me an
account of .their resolution, how one and all designed t&
forsake the ship when I came on board, for which he was
mightily concerned. u I am glad to see you, nephew," safd
I,u and rejoice it is no worse, since they have not rebelled
against you ; I only desire you to send my necessary things.,
on-shore, with a sufficient sum of money, and I will find
my way to England as well as I can." Though this griev-
ed my nephew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but
compliance : in short, all my necessaries were sent me, and
so this matter was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues farther off
England by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif-
ference, that I might travel by land over the Great Mogul*s .
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, by sea up the
Persian Gulph, then take the way of the caravans;.over the
Arabian desert to Aleppo and Scaader.oonj there take-ship*:
T %
ping to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from
thence across the sea to England.
My nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of
them was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser,
who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings in an English
woman's house, where several French, one English, and
two Italian merchants resided. The handsome entertain-
ment I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months,
considering what course'I should take. Some English
goods I hUd with me of great value, besides a thousand
pieces of eight, and a letter for more, if there was such a
necessity. The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and
bought here several good diamonds, which I could easily
carry about with me. One morning the English merchant
«ameto me, as being very intimate together, " Country-
man," said he, u I have a project to communicate to you,
which I hope will suit to both our advantage. To be shorty
Sir, we are both in a remote part of the world from our
country; but yet in a place where men of business may
get a great deal of money. Now, if you will put a thou-
sand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship
to our satisfaction; you shall be Captain, I will be mer-
chant ; and we'll go a trading voyage to China, for why
should we lie still like drones, while the whole world is in
a continued motion."
This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreea-
ble to my rambling genius; and the more so, because I
looked upon my countryman to be a very sincere person;
it required some time before we could get a vessel to our
mind, and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we
bought a snip, and got an English mute, boatswain, and
gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese fore-
masimcn; and, for want of others, made shift with Indian
seamen. We first sailed to Achin, in the island of Suma-
tra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for
some arrack and opium, the last of which bore a great price,
among the Chinese; in a word, we went up to Suskan,
making a very great voyage; and after eight months time,
I returned to Bengal, very well satisfied with this adven-
ture, having not only got a sufficient quantity of money,
but an insight of getting a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go
amor.K t«-e hoicc Islands, and bring home a load of cloves
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; islands belonging part-
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem-
ber, and returning home in about five months time. We
soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them
away for the gulph; and in short, making five to one ad-
vantage, we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made up our ac-
counts, to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch
coaster from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The
crew of this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that
there were not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage, and
the Captain having given out that he intended to go to
Europe, public notice was given that the ship was to be
sold. No sooner did this come to our ears, but we bought
the ship, paid the master and took possession* We would
also have very willingly entertained some of the men;
but they having received their share of booty, were not to
be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the great city of
the Mogul's residence; and from thence went to travel to
Surat, and so by the sea to the Persian Gulph, And indeed
they had reason to fly in this manner; for the truth of it
was, the pretended Captain was the gunner only, and not
the commander; that having been on a trading voyage,
they were attacked on shore by the Malayans, who killed
three men and the Captain; after whose death the other
eleven men run away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal*
and left the mate and five men more on shore; but of this
affair we shall have occasion to speak more at length here-
after.
However they came by the ship, we thought we bought
it honestly; neither did we suspect any thing of the mat-
ter; when the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship
(undoubtedly forged)to one Emanuel Clostershoved,whieh
name he went by. And so without any more to do, we pick-
ed up some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for ano-
thei voyage for cloves among the Philipine and Molucca
Islands: in short, we continued thus five or six years, tra-
ding from port to port with extraordinary success. -In the-
seventh year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing
to touch at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. In thiV
voyage, contrary winds beat us up and down for a consider*
able time among the islands m tiic Straits of Molucca. N*
sooner were we clear of those rugged seas, but we per-
ceived our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put
into the river Cambodia, which lies northward of the
Guiph, -and goes up to Siarn.
One day, as I was on shore refreshing1 myself, there
comes to me an Englishman, who was gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, riding up the river near
the city of Cambodia: "Sir," said he, " you may wonder
at my business, having never seen me in your life; but
tho' I am a stranger, 1 have something to tell you that ve-
ry nearly concerns you ; and indeed it is the imminent dan-
ger you arc in has moved me to give you this timely no-
tice." u Danger 1" said L " what danger: I know of none,
except my ship being leaky, for which 1 design to have her
run aground to-morrow morning." "I hope you will be
better employed when you shall hear what I have to say
to you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen
leagues up this river ; about three leagues on this side of it,
there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would
you venture here without considering what strength you
have to engage them?" I knew not what he meant by this
discourse, and turning short upon him, "Sir," said I,
"I know no reason I have to be affraid either of any Dutch
or English ships. I am no interloper, and what business
have they with me?" "Well, Sir," said the man, "if
you do think yourselves secure, all as I can say, you must
take your chance; however, I am very sorry you are so
deaf to good advice; but I assure you, if you do not put
to sea immediately, you will be attacked by five long-boats
full of men, hanged yourself for a pirate, if you are taken,
and the particulars examined afterwards." "I thought.
Sir," added he, " I might have met a better reception for
such a singular piece of service." "Sir," said I, u I was
never ungrateful to any man ; but pray explain yourself,
and I'll go on board this minute, whether the leak be stop-
ped or no." "Why, Sir," said he, " to be short, because
time is precious,the matter is this : You know well enough
that you was with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain
was murdered by the Malayans, with three of his sailors;
and that either you, or some who were onboard you, ran
away with the ship, and are since turned pirates at sea.
Now, Sir, this is the sum of what I had to say, and I can
positively assure you> that if you are taken, you will be ex-
ecuted without much ceremony, for undoubtedly you can
not but be sensible what little law merchant ships show to
pirates, whenever they fall into their hands."
"Sir," said I, u I thank you for your kind information;
{t and though I am sure no man could come more honest-.
"ly by the ship than I have clone, yet knowing their enier-
"prize, and being satisfied of your honest intention, 1*11 be
"upon .my defence." "IVthee, Sir," said the man,u don't
"talk of being upon your defence, the best that you can
"make is to be out of danger; and therefore, it you have
"any regard for your life, and the lives of your men, take
"the advantage, without fail, of putting out to sea at high
"water; by which means, as you huve a whole tide before
"you, you will be gone too far out of their reach before
"they can come down."
u I am mighty well satisfied," said I, " in this particu-
lar, and for your kindness, which merits my great esteem,
pray Sir, what amends shall I make you?" he replied, " I
know not what amends you are willing to make, because
you may have some doubts of its certainty: but to con-
vince you of the truth of what I say, I have one offer to
make to you. On bo.ird of one of the English ships, I
have nineteen months pay due me, and this Dutchman
that is with me has seven months pay due to him. which
if you will make good to us, we will go along with you.
If you shall find that there is nothing in what we have
said, then we shall desire nothing; but when you are con-
vinced that we have saved the ship, your life, and the lives
of the men, we will leave the whole to your generosity.**
So reasonable did this every way appear, that I.imme-
diately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon ~
as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, That
they had stopped the leak. "Well, thank God," said I,
"but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith." u Weigh,"
said he, "what is the meaning of this hurry?" u Pray,
ask no questions," said I, " but all hands to work, without
losing a moment's time." Upon which, in great surprise,
the Captain was called, who immediately ordered the an-
chor up; and although the tide was not quite down, yet,
being assisted by a little land breeze, we stood to sea. I
then called my partner into the cabin, and related the sto-
ry at large, which was confirmed and more amplified jby
the two men I had brought on board. Scarce had we fin*
ishetl our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came t©
the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, that We
were chased by five sloops full of armed men. "Very
"well," said 1,44 it is plain now there is something in it."
And so, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a
design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for pirates;
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us
and by one another? To which they unanimously replied,
"That they would fight to the last drop of blood." I then
asked the Captain, which way he thought best for us to
manage the battle ?" Sir," said he, u the only method is
to keep them off with our great shot, as long as we are
able, and then have recoure to our small arms; and when
these fail us, then retire to close quarters, when perhaps
the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open our
bulk heads, nor get in upon us." Mean time the gunner
was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and
small pieces of old iron ; and the deck being cleared, we
prepared for an engagement, still, however, keeping out
to sea. The boats followed us with all the sail they could
make, and we could perceive the two foremost *,vere En-
glish, which out sailed the rest by two leagues, and which
we found would come up with us: hereupon, we fired a
gun without ball, intimating that they should come to,
and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley;
but finding them crowding after us, till they came within
fchdt, we took in our white, and hanging out the red flag,
immediately fired at them with ball: we then called to
them with a speaking trumpet, bidding them at their pe-
ril to keep off.
But all this signified nothing; for depending upon the
strength which followed them, they were resolutely bent
for mischief: hereupon I ordered them to bring the ship
to, by which means, they lying upon our broadside, we
1st fly at them at once, one of whom carried away the stern
of the hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take
down their sail, but made them run to the head of the
boat, to keep them from sinking, and so she lay by, haV-»
ing enough of it. In the mean time, we prepared to wel-
come the foremost boat in the same manner. While we
were doing this, one of the three hindermost boats came
up to the relief of that which was disabled, and took the
men out her. We again called to parley with them;
tout, instead of an answer, one of the boats came under aur>
stern; whereupon our gunner let fly his two stern chase
guns, but missing, the men in the boat shouted, and wa-
ving their caps, came on with greater fury. To repair
this seeming disgrace, the gunner soon got ready, and fir-
ing a second time, did a great deal of mischief among the
enemy. We waved again, and, bringing our quarter to
bear upon them, fired three guns more, when we found
the boat a sinking, and several men already in the sea;
hereupon, manning the pinnace, 1 gave orders to save as
many as they could, and instantly to come on board, be-
cause the rest of their boats were approaching; accord-
ingly they did so, and took up three of them, one of whom
was almost past recovery; and then crowding all the sail
we could, after our men came on board, we stood out far-
ther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the
chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus deliver-
ed from imminent danger, we changed our course to the
Eastward, entirely out of the course of all the European
ships.
Being now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the
two seamen, the meaning of all this, the Dutclwnan at once
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold
us the ship was an errant thief, who had run away with
her; that the Captain was treacherously murdered on the
coast of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his
men; that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being oblig-
ed to have recourse to the woods for their safety, at length
escaped by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China,
which had sent their boat on shore for fresh water: That
after this, he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship (who had deserted the rest in their
travels) arrived, and there gave an account that the fellow
who ran away with the ship had sold her at Bengal to a
set of pirates, who went a cruising, and had already tak-
en one English and two Dutch ships, richly laden.
Now, tho* this was abbolutely false, my partner truly
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the
more, by reason, had we failen into their hands, we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate death,
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and
therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal,
where, being known, we could prove how honestly \ve
came by the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like,
and where we were sure of some justice ^ at least would
not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. I was at first
of my partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously
considered of the matter, I told him, we ran a great haz-
ard in attempting to return, being on the wrong side of
the straits of Molucca, and that if, upon alarm given, we
should be taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English else-
where, our running away would be sufficient evidence to
condemn us. This danger indeed startled not only my
partner, but likewise all the ship's company; so we chang-
ed our former resolution, and resolved to go to the coast
of Tonquin, and so to that of China, where, pursuing
our first design as to trade, we might have an opportunity
to dispose of the ship some way or other, and to return to
Bengal in any country vessel'we could procure. This be-
ing agreed to, we steered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues
off the usual course to the east, which put us to some in-
conveniences. As the wind blew steadily against us, our
voyage became more tedious, and we began to be affraid
of want of provision; and what was still worse, we appre-
hended, that as those ships, from whose boats we had es-
caped, were bound to China, they might get before us, and
have given fresh information, which might create another
vigorous pursuit. Indeed, I could not help being griev-
ed, when I considered that I, who had never wronged or
defrauded any person in my life, was now pursued like a
common thief, and if taken to run the greatest danger of
being executed as such; and, though innocent, 1 found
myself under the necessity of flying for my safety; and
thereby escape being brought to shame, of which I was
even more affraid than of death itself. It was easy to read
ray dejection in my countenance. My mind was oppres-
sed, like those unhappy, innocent persons, who being over-
powered by blasphemous and perjured evidences, wicked-
ly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin their reputation,
have no other recourse in this world to ease their sorrow,
but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner seeing me so
concerned, encouraged me as well as he could ; and, after
describing to me the several ports of that coast, he told
me. he would either put me in on the coast of Cochinchi-
na, or else in the bay of Tonquin, from whence we *night
go to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portuguese, and
where- still many European families resided.
To this place we steered> and early next morning, came
in sight of the coast \ but thought it advisable to put into
a small river where we could, either over land, or by the
ship's pinnace, know what vessels were in any ports there-
abouts. This happy step proved our deliverance; for,
next morning, there came to the bay of Tonquin, two
Dutch ships, and a tliird, without any colours; and in the
evening, two English steered the same course. The riv-
e#where we were was but small, and run but a few leagues
up the country northward; the country was wild and bar-
barous, and the people thieves, having no correspondence
with any other nation ; dealing only in fish, oil, and such
gross commodities: and one barbarous custom they still
retained, that when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked
upon their coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves;
so that now we might fairly say we were surrounded by
enemies both by sea and land.
As the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity,
in this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and
bringing our guns and other moveable things to one side,
we essayed to bring her down, that we might come to her
bottom: but, upon second consideration, we did not think
it safe to let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such
a sight as to see a ship lie down on the side, and heel in
towards the shore, and not perceiving her men, who were
at work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-
side, presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and
lay fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition,
they surrounded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a
resolution, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and to carry
away those they found alive for slaves to their king. But
when they perceived our men hard at work 0*11 the ship's
bottom and side, washing, graving, and stopping her, it rill-
ed them all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as
though they were confounded. Nor could we imagine
what their design was; however, for fear of danger, we
handed down arms and ammunition to those at work, in
order to defend themselves; and, indeed, this precaution
was absolutely necessary; for, in a quarter of an hour af-
ter, the natives, concluding it was really a shipwreck^ and
that We were saving our lives and goods, which they
thought belonged to them, came down upon our men, as"'
though it had been in line of battle. We lay at present
but in a very unfit posture to fight j and before the stages/
could be got down, or the men in the boat come on board
as they were ordered, the Cochinchinese were upon them,
and two of their boats boarding our long-boat, they began
to lay hold of our men as prisoners. The first they seiz-
ed was a stout English sailor, who never fired his musket,
like a fool as I imagined, but laid it down in the boat: but
* he knew what he was doing; for, by main force, he clra%-
ged the Pagan out of the boat into ours by the two ears,
and knocked his brains out against the boat's gunnel; a
Dutchman that was next him snatched up the musket,
and knocked down five more with the butt-end of it ; how-
ever, this was doing very little to their number; but a
strange unexpected accident, which rather merits laugh-
ter than any thing else, gave our men a complete victo-
ry over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pilch, and the
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff,
and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-
low stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil-
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked
made them roar out, and jump into the sea. "Well done
w Jack," says the carpenter, u give them the other dose
and so stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping
it into the pitch-pot, he and his man so plentifully slung it
among them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon
Sfhich they all made the best of their way, crying and
howling in such a frightful manner, that, in all my adven-
tures, I never heard the like. And, indeed, never was I
better pleased with any conquest than I was with this, there
being so little bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing
such savage wretches (more than was necessary) as know-
ing they came on errands, which their laws and customs
made them think were just and equitable. By this time,
all things being in orc'er, and the ship swimming, they
found their mistake, so they did not venture a second at-
jc^ack. Thus ended our merry fight; -and, having got rice,
^f&ead, roots, ami sixteen good hogs on board the day be-
fore we set sail, not daring to go into the bay of Tonquin,
but steered N. E. toward the isle of Formosa, or as tho*
we would go to the Manillas, or Philippine islands, for
fear of meeting with any European ships; when.we an*
chored at the isle of Formosa, the inhabitants not only
courteously supplied us with provisions and fresh water,
but dealt very fairly and honestly with us in their bargains
and agreements. From this place we steered north, keep-
ing still off the coast of China, till we were beyond ail its
ports where European ships usually come; and, at length,
being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved
to put into the first trading port we should come at; and
standing for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us,
with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who offered his ser-
vice; we very gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back
again. And now, having the old rrvan on board, I talked
to him of going to Nanquin, the most northward part of
the coastpf China. "What will you do there?5* said he,
smiling. I told him we would sell our cargo, and pur-
chase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, Sec. and so re-
turn the same way back. "O," said he, " you had better
put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares as cheap
as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater advance/*
"But," said I, u we are gentlemen, as well as merchants,
and design to see the great city of Pekin, and the magnifi-
cent court of the monarch of China.** "Why, then,** said
he, u you should go to Ningpo, where there is a naviga-
ble river that goes through the heart of that vast empire,
two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, which
crosses all the rivers, passes considerable hills, by the help
of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the city ol
Pckin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please, and trav-
el to Pekin, and tliere is a Dutch ship just before bound
that way." At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I
was struck with confusion ; they being as great a terror to
me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them
in the Mediterranean. The old man finding me troubled,
u Sir*" said he, "I hope the Dutch are not now at war
"with your nation.*' u No," said I, " but God knows what
"liberty they may take when out of the reach of the law/*
"Why," says he, " what occasion is there for peaceable
"merchants to fear? For, believe me, they never meddle*
« with any but PIRATES."
At the mentioning th-e word pirates, my countenance
turned to that of scarlet; nor was it possible for me to cori^
peal it from the old pilot * who taking notice of it,M Sir/'
said he, " take what course you please, I'll do you all the
"service I can." "Seignior," said I," I am a little sur-
prised at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none
suc h in these seas, because you see in what weak condition
we are to defend ourselves." "O Sir," said he, " if that's
all, don't be concerned, for I don't remember one in these
seas these fifteen years, except about a month ago, one
was seen in the bay of Siam, but he has gone to the south-
ward; neither was she built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate captain, and some of his men,
the right captain having been murdered by the Malayans."
u What," said I, « did they kill the captain ?" "No,"
said he, " it is generally thought the Malayans murdered
him; but perhaps they might procure them to do it, and
therefore they justly deserve hanging. The rogues were
lately discovered in the bay of Siam,, in the river of Cam-
bodia, by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and
had much ado to escape the five boats who pursued them,
but they have solemnly sworn to give no quarter to the
captain or the seamen, but hang them every one up at the
yard-arm, without any formal business of bringing them
to a court martial."
Being sensible that having the old man on board, he was
incapable of doing me any mischief, well, Seignior, said I,
"it is for this very reason I would have you carry us up to
Nanquin, whe^e neither English nor Dutch ships come;
and I must tell you their Captains are a parcel of rash,
proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs to
justice, nor to behave themselves as the laws of God or
nature direct: fellows that would prove murderers to pun-
ish robbers, and take upon them to adjudge innocent men
to.death, without any proof to prove them guilty; but per-
haps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed."
And so I told him all the story oi buying the ship, and how
we were saved by means of two men: that the murder of
the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away
with the ship, I believed to be true; but that we who bo't
it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover their
cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked us,
and the blood of those men we killed in our own justde*
fence, lay at their door, who sent to attack us by surprise.
«" Sir," said the old man amazed, " you have taken the
right course to steer to the north, and if I might advise
you, I would rather have you sell the-ship in China, and
buy, or build another in that country; and Fil procure
people to buy the one and sell the other." "Well, but
Seignior," said I, 44 if I sell the ship in this manner, I
may bring some innocent peisons into the same dangers-
I have gone through, perhaps worse,. even death itself;
-whereby I should he as guilty of their murder as their vil-
lainous executioners." u That need not trouble you/*
said the old man, " Til find a way to prevent that; for
these commanders you talk of, I know very well, and will
inform them rightly of the matter as you have related, and
I am persuaded they will not only believe me, but act
more cautiously for the future." u And will you deliver one
message from me to them?" "Yes," said he, " if you will
give it under your hand, that I may prove it is not of my
own production.'* Hereupon I wrote a large account of
their attacking me in their long boats, the pretended rea-
son and unjust design of it; that they had done what they
might be ashamed of, and could not answer in any tribu-
nal in England. But this letter was wrote in vain. Provi-
dence ordered things in another way* We sailed direct-
ly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days sail, came to an
anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulph of'that
place, where we learned that two Dutch ships were gone
the length before us, and that we should certainly fali
into their hands. We were all at a great loss in this ex-
igency, and would very gladly have been on shore almost
any where; but our old piiot told me that if I would sail
to the southward about two and forty leagues, there was
a little port called Quinchange, where no European ships
ever came, and where we might consider what was fur-
ther to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor* the
next day, calling only twice on shore by the way, to get
fresh water. The country people very courteously sold
us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. 'Ab<3$£
five days sail Lrought us to the port* where we landed
with unspeakable joy. We resolved to dispose of our-
selves and effects jniiny other way possible, than enter on
board that ill fated vessel any more; for no s£age can be
more misererf)le than a continued fear, whicb S$a life of
de^th* a confounder of our understandings, tb$£ sets--the
imagination at work to find a thousand -dreadful things
tfeat may never happen. And we scarce slept one night
%ithout dreaming of baiters, yard-arms and gibbets, or off
fighting, being taken, and being killed; nay, so violent
were our apprehensions that we would bruise our hands
and heads against the sides of the cabin, as though actual-
ly engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna,
often came into our thoughts when awake; and for my
part, I thought my condition very hard,that after so many*
difficulties and such signal deliverances, I should be
hanged in my old age, though innocent of any crime that
deserved such punishment; but then religion would seem
to represent to me, as though the voice of it had said, con-
sider, O man! what sins you have been guilty of; which
now thou art called to an account for, to expiate with thy
blood! and as to thy innocence, what art thou more inno-
cent than thy blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ, who suffer-
ed for thy offences, and to whose providence you ought
to submit, let what will happen? After this, natural cour-
age would inspire me to resist to the last drop of blood,
and sooner die than suffer myself to be taken by boorish,
rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to torment beyond even
death itself.
But now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, our old pi-
lot procured us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods;
it was a little hut, with a large warehouse belonging to it,
all built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large ones,
to keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in
that quarter. The magistrates allowed us a little guard
during the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind
of haibert for three pence a clay. The fair, or mart, we
found had been over for some time; however there re-
mained in the river four junks and two Japan ships, the
merchants of the latter being on shore. Jn the first place
our. Okl pilot brought us acquainted with the missionary
Roman priests, who were converting the people to Chris-
tianity : two of then) were reserved, rigid, and austere,
applying themselves to the work they came about with
great earnestness: but the third, who was a Frenchman,
called Father Simon, was of a freer conversation, not seem-
ingly so serious and grave, yet no worse Christian than
the other two, one of whom was a Portuguese, and the
other a Genoese. Father Simon, it seems, was appointed ,
to go to Pekin, the royal seat of the Emperor of the Chi-
nese; and he only waited for another priest who wtfs or-
dered from Macao to accompany him. We never ni^J;^.
together, but he was prompting me to accompany him -
235
that journey: "Sir," said he, " I will shew you the glo-
rious things of this mighty Empire, and a city, the city of
Pekin, far exceeding London and Paris, put them both
together.*' One day in particular,being at dinner with him,
| showed some inclination to go; which made him' press
the more upon me and my partner, to gain our perfect
consent. 4t But father Simon," said 1, " what satisfaction
can you have in our company whom you esteem as here-
tics, and consequently objects not worthy of your regard.'*
"O," said he, u you may be as good Catholics in time,
"as those I hope to convert to our religion." "And so,"
said I, 44 we shall have you preaching to us all the way, in-
44 stead of pleasing us wit,h a description of the country."
44 Sir," said he,44 however our religion may be villifiedby
"some people, it is very certain it neither divests us of
44 good manners or Christian charity : and as we are gen-
41 tic men, as such we may converse together, without
"making one another uneasy."
But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was
but very little trade in the place where we were; and I
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam, and
so to the city of Nanquin ; but Providence ordered it other-
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us, to
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opi-
um, for which he gave us a very good price in go[d by
weight, some wedges of which were about ten or eleven
ounces. It came into my head that perhaps he might buy
the ship too; and I ordered his interpreter to propose it to
him. He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders;
yet in a few days after he came accompanied by a mission-
ary priest, who was . his interpreter, with this proposal^
44 That as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he
had not money enough to purchase our ship ; bi^-if I pleas-
ed he would hire her, with all my men, to go to^Ji^iri, and
from thence with another loading to the Philipirie islands,
the freight of both which he would very willingly pay to
us before ; and at their return to Japan,wouldbuy the ship."
Upon this we asked the Captain and his men, if they were
wiling to go to Japan ; to which they unanimously agreed.
WPftJe this was in agitation, the young man my nephew
If ft tc-attend me, told me, 44 That as I did not care to a€*
)&pt thk prospect of advantage, he would manage it fe>r
Aeaa I pleased, and render me a faithful acc^i^t i>f hi*
 
success, which would be wholly mine." Indeed T was ve-
ry unwilling to part with him; but considering it might
be for the young man's good, I discoursed with my part-
ner about it, who, of his own generosity, gave him his
share of the vessel, so that I could do no otherwise than~~
give him mine: but however, we let him have but' the
proper half of it, and preserved a power, that when we
xnet in England, if l\e had obtained »urcess, he shoufd ac-
count to us for one half of t^.e profits of the ship's freight,
ann the other should be his own. Thus having taken a -
writing under his hand, away he sailed to Japan, where
the merchant dealt very honestly by him, got him a li-
cence to come on shore, senl' him loaded to the Phiiipines
with, a Japanese supercargo, from whence he came back
again loaded with European goods, cloves and other spice-
ries. By this voyage he cleared a considerable sum of mo-
ney, which determined him not to sell his ship, but to trade
on his own account ; so he returned to the Manillas,
where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, was
hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulcoin Amer-
ica, on the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to the
great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly to
account*, and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica,
returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider
those men who saved our lives when in the river of
Cambodia; and tho* by the way, they were a couple of
Eogucs, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each
of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman
a gunner, and the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they
were very well contented.
We were now about 1000 leagues farther from home
than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could expect was, -
that there being another fair to be kept in a month's time,
we might not only purchase all sorts of that country's ma-
nufactures, but very possibly find some Chinese junks, or
vessels from Tooquin, to be sold, which would carry us and
dur goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes, we
resolved to continue; and to divert ourselves, we took sev-
eral little journies in the country. About ten days after we
parted with our ship, we travelled to see the city oENarir
^uin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north ohiie liti^.
il is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight.
and cross one another in direct lines, which sets it out to
the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest
was come from Macao, that was to accompany father Si-
mon to Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me toac-
company^ him, and I referred him to my partner. In
short, we both agreed, and prepared accordingly; and we
were so lucky as to have liberty to travel among the reti-
nue of one of their Mandarine, who is a principal magis-
trate, and much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling through this
miserable country, infinitely populous, but as indifferent-
ly cultivated; and yet their pride is infinitely greater
than their poverty, insomuch that the priests derided
them. As we passed by the house of one of their country
gentlemen, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honor,
forsooth, to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles.
Never was Don Quixote so exactly 1 Never was such a
compound of pomp and poverty seen before I
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very-
proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though
torn and rent in almost every part; his vest underneath it
was no less dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most
exquisite sloven or greasy butcher: his horse (worse than
Rosinante, or the famous steed of doughty Hudibras) was"
a poor starved decriped thing, that would not sell for thir-
ty shillings in England ; and yet this piece of worshipful
pomp was attended with ten or twelve slaves who guarded
their master to his country-seat.. We stopped at a little vil-
lage for refreshment; and when we came by the country-
seat of this great man, we found him sitting under a tree
before his door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great
piece of garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green
pepper by him, and another plant like ginger,together with
a piece of lean mutton in it: this was his worship's repast;
but pray observe the state of the food 1 two women slaves
brought him his food, which being laid before.Jtiim, two
others appeared to perform their respective offices; one
fed him with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell
on his beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular fa-^
vorite to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased witfeHf
the conceit of our admiring his magnificence, which ra*
ther merited our scorn and detestation.
At length we arrived at the great city oi Pekin, accom*
panied by two servants, and the oid Portuguese pilot,
whose charges we bore, and who served us as an interpre-
ter by the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but
be conies laughing to us, u Ah ! Seignior Inglise," said he,
"me something tell you make your heart glad, but make
me sorry: for you bring me here twenty-five days journey,
and now you leave me go back alone; and which way shall
I make my port after, without de ship, without de horse,
without pecune?" so he called money in his broken latin.
He then informed me, that there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who were pre-
paring to set out for Muscovy by land within six weeks;
and that he was certain we would take this opportunity,
and consequently that he must go home by himself. In-
deed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me. "Are
you certain of this r" said I. "Yes, Sir," says he, " me
sure it's true." And so he told mc, that having met an old
acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who was
among them, and who had come from Astracan, with a
design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having al-
tered his resolutions, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Astracan.
"Well, Seignior," said I, u don't be discontented about
your returning alone; and if, by this means, I can find a
passage to England, it will be your own fault ifyou return
to.Macao at all." And so consulting with my partner what
"Was best to be done, he referred it to me as I pleased, hav-
ing our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that, if he could
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks
wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England,
and so return to Bengal in the Company's ships. Thus
resolved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we
would bear his charges either to Moscow, or England; and
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and sev-
enty pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and
told him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if
he would accompany us with the caravans; and therefore,
*we desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head,
"Great long journey," said he, u me no pecunercarry me
i|p Moscow, or keep me there." But wc soon put him out
of that concern, by making him sensible of what we would
.give him here to lay out to the best advantage; and as for
his charges, we would set him safe on shore, God willing.
either in Moscovy, or England, as he pleased, at our own
charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this propo-
sal, he was like a man transported, telling us, he would
go with us all the world over; and we made preparations
for our journey ; hut it was near four months before all
the merchants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went ex-
press to the port where we first put in, to dispose of what
goods had been left thete, while I accompanied a Chi-
nese merchant who was going to Nanquin, and there
bought twenty-nine pieces of damask, with about three
hundred more of other fine silks; and by the time my
partner returned to Pekia, I had them all carried there;
our cargo in silks amounted to 4500/. sterling, which, to-
gether with lea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded
eighteen camels for our share, besides what we rode upon,
with two or three spare horses, and two more loaden with
provisions; the company now was very great, making
about four hundred horse, and above one hundred and
twenty men, well armed and provided. We were of
several nations, among whom were five Scotch merchants,
inhabiting in Moscow, and well experienced in trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of February our
style ; and in two days more, we passed through the gate
of the great China wall, which was erected as a fortification
against the Tartars, being one hundred English miles lorn***
We then entered a country not near so populous, chiefly
under the power of plundering Tartars, several companies
of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses, con-
temptible as themselves, without order or discipline. One
time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go a hunting;
but what do you think we hunted? only a parcel of sheep,
which indeed exceeded any in the world for wiklnessand
swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, it was
our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who ho soon-
er perceived us, but one of them blew a horn, at .the sound
of which there soon appeared a troop of forty or fifty more,,
at about a mile's distance. Hereupon one of the Scots meav.
chants (who knew their ways) ordered us to advance ttfc
wards them, and attack them immediately. As we ad*j
Tanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happily fell
a little short of us ; this made us halt a little, to return the-
compliment with bullets; and then being led up by-the
hold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew out-
 
our swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew like
timorous sheep, and only three of them remained, beck-
oning to the rest to come back. But our brave command-
er gallops up to them by himself, shot one dead, knocked
another off his horse, while the third ran away; and thus
ended our battle with the Tartars.
We travelled a month more through the Emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their
towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person I spoke to
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go
alon^ with hrm, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety,
when coming to the place where the camels were kept as
in a pack guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed
and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along
with me led along the road. But we had not gone far,
before we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horse-
back, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from
him, and rode away, while the other three approached us,
the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing
my sword, the second knocked me down, but my old trus-
ty Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I
knew nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck
me, he with one hand pulled him off his h'orse, and then
shot him dead upon the spot; then taking his scymitar, he
struck at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cut
off one of his horse's ears, the pain of which made him
"illrow his rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who
had led the camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him,
and seizing upon his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands,
and knocked his brains out. But there was another Tar-
tar to deal with, who seeming neither inclined to fight nor
fly, and my old man having began to charge his pistol, the
very sight of it struck such a terror into the wretch, that
away he scoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my cham-
pion and defender, an absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I began
to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having quite
^forgot all that passed ; but my senses returning, and feel-
ing a great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was run-
ning over my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my feet,
'and grasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to
take revenge: but no enemies how'remained except the
dead Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards
me, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, at the
same time examining into my wound, which was far from
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man
demanded payment for his camel, which I refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with
great impartiality: Having heard both sides, he asked the
Chinese man that went with me, whose servant he was?
"Sir," said he, " I am nobody's, but went with the stranger
at his request "Why then," said the judge, " you are
the sranger's servant for the time, and the camel being
delivered to his servant, it is the same as though delivered
to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it/' Indeed
the case was so fairly stated, that I had nothing to object
to it; so, having paid for that I was robbed of, I sent for
another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as I had enough
of that sport before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire,
so fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars
cannot batter down their walls; by which certainly one
might think one of our cannons would do more execution*
than all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city, we had
information that the governor had sent messengers to eve*
ry part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans
to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu-
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the
city. This news put us into great consternation ; but obey-
ing the orders, we stopt ; and two days after, there came
two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese, ami
three hundred more from Naum; thus guarded botiffa
the front and rear, with our own men in the Oanks, we bold-
ly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with tejBet,
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. ~ glf
Early next morning, in our march from a little well spoli-
ated town called Changu, after having passed a river, and
entered upon a desert of about fifteea or sixteen miles over,
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy- was approaching. This much dispirited the
Chinese. My old pilot took notice of it* and called out#
"Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged* or
they will ruin us all; and I am afraid if the Tartars at*
tack us, they will all run away.'* " Why Seignior,** said f,
w what shall be done in this case?" "Done," says he, " why
let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing.
I know the fellows will fight well enough in company."
We accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the
right wing, and the same number to the left, and with the
rest made a line of reserve, leaving the two last hundred
men to guard the camels, or to assist u$, as occasion re-
quired.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward,
viewing our posture, and traversing the ground on the front
of our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move
on, and give them a salute with their shot, which accord-
ingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings; for
immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched
away and we saw no more of them. They had undoubted-
ly given an account to their companions of what reception
they might expect, which made them so easily give over
their enterprize*
When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one
day, and then proceeded on our travels, passing several
great rivers and deserts, and on the 13th of April we came
to the frontiers of Muscovy, the first town of which was
called Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into a
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots mer-
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice
too soon ; " for," said he, "except the Russian soldiers
in garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the
road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand
miles, is inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous
Pagans/*
We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate jour*
nies, and found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with
v.Christian soldiers, for the security of commerce, and for
^the convenient lodgings of travellers : but the inhabitants of
the country were mere pagans, worshipping the sun,moon,
and stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians,
called Nerisinkey. Being curious to see their way of liv-
ing, while thp caravan continued to rest themselves in that
^ city, I went: to one of their villages, where there was to
be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld, upon
the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly thaicK
the representation of the devil himself: its head resem-
bled no living creature ; its ears were as big and as high
as goat's horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouth, and
horrible teeth : it was clothed in sheep skins, had a great
Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing thro' it, and*|&s
eight feet high, without feet, legs, or proportion. Before
this idol there lay sixteen or seventeen people, who brought
their offerings, and were making their prayers, while at a
distance stood three men, and one bullock, as victims to
this ugly monster..
Such stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing the true
God of his honor, filled me with the greatest astonishment
and reflection: which soon turning to rage and fury, I rode
up to the image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was on
his head with my sword, so that it hung down by one of
the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled
at it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideous
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two or
three hundred people coming about our ears, we were
obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monster; for the caravan
being to rest three days in the town, I told the Scots mer-
chant what I had seen, and that I was resolved to take four
or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the
idol, and show the people how little reason they had to
trust in a god who could not save himself. At first he laugh-
ed at me, representing the danger of it, and when it was
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them better
things, whose zeal and ignorance was in the highest de-
gree, and both unparallelled? that if I should be taken hy
them, I should be served as a poor ruffian, who contemned
their worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the
top of the idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was
full of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monster;
"but Sir," said he, " since your zeal carries you so far,
rather than you should be alone I will accompany you, and
bring a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist
you in this design: and accordingly he brought one Cap-
tain Richardson, who hearing the story, readily consented;
but my partner declined it, being altogether out of his way:
and so we three, and my servant, resolved to execute this
exploit about midnight; but upon second thoughts we de-
ferred it to the next night, by reason that the caVavaii being
4^ go from hence the next morning, we should be out of
the governor's power. The belter to effect my design, I
procured a Tartar's sheep. skin robe, a bonnet, with bow
land arrows, and every one of us got the like habits. The
first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with
aqua vita;, gunpowder, kc. having a good quantity of tar
in a little pot: next night we came up to the idol about
eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guard-
ing it ; but we perceived a light in the house, where we
had seen the priests before. One of our men was for firing
the hut, another for killing the people,- and a third for mak-
ing them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized the
first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying his
feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like man-
ner ; and then the Scots merchant set fne to the compo-
sition, which frightened them so much, that we brought
them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we fell
to work with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed with
tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and mouth
full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire in his
bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this being
done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners and set the
idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the shape
of it Was deformed, rent, and split, which the forage utter-
ly consumed; for we staid to see its destruction, lest the
ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown themselves
in the flames. And thus we came away undisco\cred, in
the morning appeal ing as busy among our fellow travel-
lers, as no body could have suspected any other, but that we
had ^een in our beds all night.
Ne&t morning we set out, and had gone but a small
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding
satisfaction of the Russian governor for insulting their
priests, and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who
dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would \iolate this image
but some Christian miscreants; and being already no less
than thirty thousand strong, they announced war against
him and all his Christians.
The governor assured them he was ignorant of the mat-
ter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad; that in-
deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and
that he would send after them to enquire into it; and who-

ever was the offender, should be delivered into their handi^
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we should
make all the haste away possible, while he kept them in
play as long as he could. Upon this we marched two days
and two nights, stopping but very little, till at last we ar-
rived at a village called^ Plothus, and hasted to Jerawena,
another of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having
entered the desert, and passed the lake called Shaks Oser,
we beheld a numerous body of horse on the other side of
it to the north, who supposed we had passed on that side of
the lake; but either having found the mistake, or being
certainly informed of the way we took, they come upon
us towards the dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched
our camp between two little but very thick woods, with a
little river running before our front and some felled trees
with which we covered our rear; a precaution we always
took, and which we had just finished when the enemy
came up. The) did not fall on us immediately, but sent
three messengers, demanding the men who had insulted
their priests, and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungur
that they might be burnt with fire; that if this was com-
plied with, they would peaceably depart; but if not, they
would destroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one
another on receipt of this message, but Nobody was the
word, vis indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upoa.
which the le/ider of the caravan returned for answer, " tha£^
they were peaceable merchants, who meddled with non&
of their priests and gods; and therefore desired them not,
to disturb us, and put us to the necessity of defending our-
selves" But so far was this from satisfying them, tjpt
the next morning coming to our right, they let fly a Yol-
ley of arrows among us, which happily did not hurt anyr
because we sheltered ourselves behind ourbagga^e\ We
expected however to come to a closer engagement; but
were happily saved by a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who
obtaining leave of the leader to go out, mounts hrs horse*
rifles directly from our rear, and taking a circuit, comes
up to the Tartars, as though he had been sent express^ and
tells them a formal story, that the wretches who had Burnt,
the Cham Chi-Thuungu, were gone to Shiheilka, with a
resolution to burn the god Shal-Isar, belonging to the Ton-
gueses. Upon which, believing this cunning Tartar, who
was servant to our Muscovites*away they drove to Shih-

itJIka, and in less than three minutes were out of sight*
nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held
us twenty-three days march, infested with several small
companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had
the courage to attack us. After4ve had passed over this
desert, we found several garrisons to defend the caravans
from the violence of the Tartars: In particular the Gov-
ernor of Adinskoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the
next station, if we apprehended any danger. The people
here retained the same paganism and barbarity, only they
were not so dangeious, being conquered by the Musco-
vites. The clothing, both of men and women, is of the
skins of beasts, living under the ground in vaults and caves,
which have a communication with one another. They
have idols almost in every family; besides, they adore the
sun and stars, water and snow ; and the least uncommon
thing that happens in the elements, alarms them as much
as thunder and lightening does the unbelieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through this
.country. When we had gone through the desert, after
two days farther travel, we came to Jcnezoy, a Muscovite
city, on the great river so called, which wc were told part-
ed Europe and Asia. The inhabitants here were very lit-
tle better, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the
ponder will cease, when I inform my readei^of what was
Observed to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars
witllrsokliers than clergymen, and is more proud to make
them faithful subjects, than good Christians.
^ From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want
of good management and people, and those few are mostly
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next
city we came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called To-
bolski, when having been almost seven months on our
journey, and winter drawing on apace, my partner con-
sulted with me about our particular affairs, in what man-
ner we should dispose of ourselves. -We had been tpldof
sledges and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the win-
ter season, the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges

'#p^it, As I was bound to England, I now behoved eithe:
OF ROBTNSON CRUSOE,
to go with the caravan to Jeroslaw, from thence westfW
Marva, and the Gulpftof Finland, and so by land or sea to
Denmark; or else |pmust leave the caravan at a little
town on the Dwina, f§tKl so to Archangel, wh|pe I was
certain either of shipping to England, Holland, or Ham-
burgh. One night I ripened to get into the company of
an illustrious but barfj^g^ Prince, whose company and
virtues were such as mS me propose to him a method
how he might obtain his liberty. "My dear friend," said
he, " as I am here hi.ppily free from my miserable great-
"ness, with all its attendants of pride, ambition, avarice
"and luxury, if I should escape from this place, those per-
"nicious seeds may again revive,to my lasting disquietude;
"therefore, let me remain in a blessed confinement, for I
"amT)Ut flesh, a mere man, with passions and affections
"as such; O be not my friend and ten)pier too V Struck
dumb with surprise, I stood silent a-while; nor was he
less in disorder, "by which perceiving he wanted to give
vent to his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so
withdrew. But about two hours after he came to my
apartment: "Dear friend," said he, u though I cannot
"consent to accompany you, I shall have this satisfaction
"in parting, that you leave me an honest man still; but
"as a testimony of my affection to you, be pleased to ac»
"cept this present of sables."
In return for his compliment, I sent my servant, next
morning to his Lordship, with a small present of tea, twtf
pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold 5
but he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and one
piece of gold for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that
was upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and hoped
that what he had refused himself, upon his account I
would grant to another, whom he should name: In siwt
it was his only son, who was about two hundred miJes tljs*
tant from him, on the other side of tl e city* whom he
said he would send for, if I gave my consent. This fcjfetoa
complied with; upon which he sent his servantsne>&Jl|y
for his son, who returned in twenty days time, brin|p%
seven horses, loaded with valuable furs. At night the
young Lord was conducted incognito into our apartment,
where his father presented him to me. We then concerts
ed the best means for travelling, and after having j^l^fefc*
a considerable quantity of sables, black fox skins, ftte/j$r*-;
minesj &c, (which I sold at Archangel, at & good pri&e).
r$pe setout from this city the beginning of June, making a
Iggtjl caravan, being about thirty-two horses and camels,
^^Phich I represented the head. My young Lord had
^eith him a very faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted
with tile roads. We shunned the principal towns and ci-
ties, as Tumen, Soii-Kamoiski, and several others, by rea-
son of their strictness in examidMfag travellers, lest any of
the banished persons of distinctfofrlmould escape. Having
passed the river Kama, we came to a city on the Euro-
pean side, called Soloy Kamoskoi, w here we found the
people mostly Pagans, as before. We then passed a de-
sert of about two hundred miles o\f r: but in other places
it is near seven hundred. In passing this place, we were
beset by a troop of men on horseback, and about five and
forty men armed with bows and arrows. At first they look-
ed earnestly on us, and then placed themselves in our way.
We were above sixteen men, and drew up a little line be-
fore our camels. My young Lord sent out his Siberian
servant, to know who they were. But when he approach-
ed them, he neither knew-one word they said, nor would
they admit him to come near them at his peril, but pre-
pared to shoot him. At his return, he told us he believed
them to be Calmuck Tartars, and that there were more
upon the desert. This was but a small comfort to us i
yet seeing a little grove, about a quarter of a mile distant,
we moved to it, by the old Portuguese pilot's advice, with-
out meeting with any opposition. Here we found a mar-
shy piece of ground, and a spring of water running into
- a little brook on one side, which joined another like it, a
little farther off, and these two formed the head of the riv-
er called Writska. As soon as we arrived, we went to
work, cutting great arms off the trees, and laying them
• hanging (not quite off) from one tree to another. In this
situation we waited the motion of the enemy, without per-
ceiving any advancement they made towards us. About
two hours .be fore night, being joined by some others, in
all about fourscore horse, among whom we fancied were
some women, they came upon us with great fury. We
fired without ball, calling to them in the Russian tongue,
to know their business: but they either not knowing, or
seeming not to understand us, came directly to the wood
side, not considering that we were so fortified, as that they
could not break in. Our old pilot the Portuguese, proved
^oth bur eaptain and engineer, and desired us not to fire?
till they came within pistol shot: and when he gave tb%
word of command, then to take the surest aim : but he bid
us not to fire till they were within two pikes length of us,
and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded several, as
also their horses, having every one of us loaded our pie-
ces with two or three bullets at least. So much were they
surprised at our undauntedness, that they retired about
a hundred roods from us. In the mean time we loaded our
pieces again, and sallying out, secured four of their
horses, whose riders we found were killed, and perceived
them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they made
another attempt, to see where they might break in ; but
finding us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrances into the woods;
but when day-light came, we had a very unwelcome dis-
covery; for the enemy, being encouraged by their num-
bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents> in form of a camp,
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess* I
was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and
all that I had over for lost And my partner declared*
that as the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they
should be taken from him, he*would fi^ht to the last drop
of his blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we
had recourse to a stratagem: we kindled a large fire, whicji
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued
our journey towards the pole, or north star, and travelling
all night; by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus-
sian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard th.it several troops
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were part all danger. In five days after we came
to Veuslima, upon the river YVkzedga; from thence we
came to Laurenskoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a convenient
bark, we embarked the seventh, and arrived at Archangel
the eighteenth, after a year, five months, and three days
journey, including the eight months and odd days at To-
bolski. We came from Archangel the 20th of August, in;
the same year, and arrived at Hamburgh the 30th o£S&pi-
tember. Here my partner and I made a very goo#^|i|
of our goods, both those of China and Siberia ; ivhewy ^
viding our effects, my share came to 34751. lfs. SC$f?-f

been at. Here the young Lord took his leave of me, in or-
der to go to the court of Vienna, not only to seek protec-
tion, but to correspond with his father's friends. After we
had staid four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence
overland tocJtJhe Hague, were embarking in the packet, I
