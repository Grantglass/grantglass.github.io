PREFACE. 


Tins instructive and enter tainingf 
history was written about one hundred 
and fifty years ago, by a very ingenious 
and celebrated person, Daniel De Foe. 
Before he became an author, he was 
a hosier, and then a pantile-maker; 
but in business he did not succeed,

and he sunk into great distress. He 
published many works, of which 
Robinson Crusoe is the chief. It is 
said that he derived the idea of this 
story from the narrative of Alexander 
Selkirk, a sailor, who was left ashore 
on the island of Juan Fernandez, and 
was brought away by Captain Rogers, 
after he had lived there by him- 
self for many years. Let us hope 
that this tale of wonderful adven- 
tures, hitter sufferings, and perilous 
escapes will teach our young friends 
the advantages of a safe and quiet

home, and cure them of that sad 
disorder of the mind, a discontented 
and restless disposition. 


THE ADVENTURES OF 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Robinson Crusoe, according to his 
own account of himself, was, at the 
age of eighteen, a discontented and 
most unreasonable young gentleman. 
He had kind parents, a comfortable 
home, and all the advantages com- 
monly arising from prosperous cir- 
cumstances; and yet he was dissatis- 
fied. He appeared to be weary of 
good things, and to desire evil things 
for the sake of the change. You will 
see that he had more than enough of 
amazing troubles and disasters, in the 
course of his life, to teach him thfe 
value of common comforts at home. 
Our first print represents him sullen 
and dejected by the fireside, with all

things convenient about him ; his 
sister has hold of his hand, and is 
endeavouring by kindness to persuade 
him into a good humour, whilst his 
parents are representing the advantages 
he there possessed, and are pointing 
to the case of a poor beggar at the 
door, to whom a servant has been 
sent with relief but who, in the mean 
time, endures the pitiless wintry storm, 
and hunger at the same time. Robin- 
son, however, disregards all that can 
be said and done to attach him to his 
home; he becomes ill-tempered and 
reserved ; and, would you believe it, he 
forms the sad resolution of leaving his 
parents’ house without their leave or 
knowledge. I quite expect to find him 
in some dreadful situation of distress 
the next time we hear of him — let us 
see. 


12 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


O YES, here he is on board a ship in 
a storm, which is just ready to sink. 
They are getting a boat ready for him 
and the rest of the crew. I fear it is 
loo small to take them every one, I 
hope poor Robinson will escape some- 
how — that is the lad I mean ; the 
wind has just blown his hat off, do 
not you see ? Before I tell you what 
became of him this time, I must ex- 
plain how he came on board that ship, 
and where it was to have sailed. The 
case was this. Robinson had stated 
his discontents to some of his young 
acquaintances, amongst whom was a 
sailor-lad, whose father owned a vessel 
trading from Hull, in Yorkshire, to 
London. This lad told Crusoe that 
he would be liappy directly if he 
would but go to sea — a very great 
mistake, indeed, which many a boy 
finds out too late. However, Robinson

15 


disliked home and regular habits so 
much, that he took this bad advice — 
ran away from his dear parents and 
brothers and sisters without even say- 
ing Good bye, and got on board this 
vessel one fine autumn evening, in 
company with his sailor-friend. I am 
afraid that neither of these lads told 
the captain of the vessel the truth, 
or he would not have taken them; 
out so it was ; they sailed out of the 
iver Humber, and very delightful it 
eemed at first; but, in a few hours, 
he wind rose, and blew most boiste- 
rously; the waves flew over the ship, 
and tossed it up and down. Robinson 
was dreadfully sick, and could not keep 
his legs. At last the ship was thrown 
upon some rocks, which knocked a 
great hole in it ; so that they began to 
sink, and were obliged to take to their 
boat, as I said before. 


16 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Well, and so as soon as poor Robin- 
son and all the people had got into the 
little boat, the great ship went down ! 
Yes, it sunk down, down, down, into 
the sea, till at last even the top of the 
mast was covered by the waves. All 
the corn and merchandise which were 
to have been sold in London for 
thousands of pounds, and all the ship, 
that had cost thousands too, with their 
boxes of clothes, and every thing, were 
all lost at once, and never heard of 
more. But Robinson and the rest of 
them had no time to think of these 
things, for they were afraid, every 
moment, that their little boat, wifli 
themselves in it, would also go down, 
the weather was so tempestuous, the 
sea was so rough, and their boat was 
so overloaded. But it pleased Pro-

vidence to spare all their lives that 
time. They arrived, at length, at a 
place called Yarmouth, in Norfolk, 
weak, and hungry, and frightened, 
and miserable, I assure you ; but the 
people of the town were very good to 
them, and gave them food, lodging, and 
clothes ; was not that very kind ? 

Robinson tells us that he had at this 
lime some money in his pocket, with 
which he might have returned home, 
if he had pleased. He had some 
thoughts of doing so; but unhappily, 
felt more ashamed of seeing his 
friends again, and confessing his fault, 
than of continuing to be a disobedient 
runaway lad. So he proceeded to 
London, where it appears some rela- 
tions of his were then living. 


20 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson Crusoe does not tell us 
much of his visit to London, but that 
he was still bent on going abroad, and 
in fact obtained money of some of his 
relations for that purpose. Perhaps 
they thought it better that he should 
go, unsettled and contrary as his dis- 
position was, than be forced back 
again to make his parents miserable by 
his ill-humour. So, after spending 
some time in London, young Crusoe 
embarked in a trading vessel, bound 
for Guinea, on the coast of Africa, 
taking with him a few toys and trities, 
to deal with the natives for their 
gold-dust. The engraving represents 
him offering some strings of beads and 
a hatchet for some gold-dust, brought 
to him by a black prince — not the

member. 

Robinson says, that this was the 
only successful voyage he ever made. 
He gained about £300 in money, and 
some knowledge of navigation into the 
bargain. He again returned to Lon- 
don ; but, strange to tell, did not visit 
his parents at York, nor take any no- 
tice of his other relations. 


24 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson had now money enough 
to become the master of a Guinea 
trading vessel, and soon set out again 
to try his fortunes. They were mis- 
fortunes indeed this time; for his 
vessel was taken by Moorish pirates; 
that is, sea robbers from Morocco, and 
lie and all the crew were made pri- 
soners — that is, slaves. See now 
Robinson Crusoe reduced from pros- 
perity to slavery — from the condition 
of a gentleman’s son, or a merchant 
on his own account, to that of a toiling 
drudge in the house and garden of an 
African robber ! 

Crusoe’s master sometimes employed 
him in fishing excursions ; and on one 
of these occasions, when there was 
nobody but himself, one man and a

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


27 


boy on board, Robinson began lo 
entertain the thought of making his 
escape ; so, knowing that this man 
could swim perfectly well, and that 
they were no great distance from shore, 
Robinson shoved him suddenly over- 
board, and putting out to sea with a 
fair wind, soon got out of sight of 
l^d. He easily persuaded the boy, 
named Xury, to become his servant, 
and help him all he could. And so 
they remained a long time beating 
about in the Mediterranean, and not 
knowing whereabouts they were, nor 
indeed to which place it would be best 
to go. 


28 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


As our friend Robinson Crusoe had 
not fixed in his own mind on any 
particular place to steer to, being 
chiefly anxious to keep out of the way 
of his African master, he was not 
sorry to keep out at sea, till he thought 
there was no fear of his being pursued. 
Nor was he sorry at length to come 
in sight of land, for he and the boy 
were dreadfully distressed with thirst, 
having no more water on board. 
The shore they came to he never 
knew the name of. They heard the 
voices of many strange wild beasts at 
a distance in the woods, which alarmed 
them exceedingly ; however, they 
filled their jars with water, and killed 
a hare which they had for their din- 
ner.' How they cooked it, I cannot

say ; I should think that it was served 
up without seasoning’, sauce*, or cur- 
rant jelly ! 

Whilst they were prowling abour 
on this wild shore, they came unex- 
pectedly on a most terrific sight indeed , 
— it was a very great lion, fast asleep ! 
Happily, Robinson had his gun with 
him, with which he shot the lion. 
They then went up to him, took off 
his skin, and with this returned again 
to their boat. 


32 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


I SUPPOSE that our two wanderer? 
must have sailed through the Straits 
of Gibraltar without knowing it, for 
the next we hear of them is, that 
they were steering southward in the 
Atlantic Ocean, hoping to meet with 
some European ship. If Robinson 
could have found a conveyance, then, 
safely to his father’s house at York, 
how glad he would have been ! 

They continued out at sea some 
time longer, and being much in want 
of food, they approached a shore, and 
saw some wild black people, of whom 
they obtained some supplies, but who 
seemed very much astonished, and not 
a little frightened at their unexpected 
guests, who did not wish to trouble 
them long with their company, and

C

35 


therefore soon sought and regained 
their little vessel. Whilst they were 
driving before the wind, in much 
anxiety as to their fate, Xury sud- 
denly cried out, “ O ! master, a shiji — 
a ship !” They were both overjoyed 
at the sight, which was evidently a 
European vessel ; and now their chief 
effort was to make themselves per- 
ceived ; for the vessel, though in 
sight, was not sailing towards them. 
So they hoisted a white flag as high 
as they could, and at length had the 
joy of seeing that they were observed, 
as the vessel now altered her course, 
and came towards them. 


36 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


When the siiip came up to our 
adventurers, the captain inquired of 
Robinson, in three different languages, 
who and what he was; but unhappily, 
this young man, not having improved 
his time at school, understood not a 
word he said in French, in Spanish, 
or in Portuguese. At last, a Scotch 
sailor, who chanced to be on board, 
found that Robinson was an English- 
man, and so got the needful informa- 
tion out of him ; which, when the 
captain understood, induced him to 
take the two young men on board, 
with all their goods. 

The Portuguese captain ^behaved 
very well indeed to his new guests, 
and offered to take them where he 
was going, that was to the Brazils, in 


37

South America, and to buy his boat 
at a fair price of him when he got 
there. He also offered to take the 
boy Xury, and employ him in his 
ship, which was a great benefit to 
both. 

They had a prosperous voyage to 
the Brazils. The captain, who was 
generous as well as just, refused to 
take anything of Robinson for his pas- 
sage; and, at the same time, bought aK 
he had to sell at a very good price — 
the boat, and all that was in it, with 
the lion’s skin, produced him thus a 
very useful sum of money ; the thing 
above all things needful in arriving on 
a foreign shore. 


40 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


ANd now we find Robinson Crusoe 
in quite a new situation and condition 
in life. Being recommended by the 
captain to an honest resident, who was 
master of a sugar plantation, he ac- 
quainted himself with the manner of 
cultivating that plant, and of making 
the sugar itself. At length he pur- 
chased some land, and set up planter. 

But Robinson began now to reflect 
that he could have done better than 
this at home, had he liked to have 
settled on a farm, or to any other pro- 
fession or business. In fact, though 
he was succeeding as well as he could 
expect, he began to be unhappy and 
discontented again. At length, when 
he had been about four years in the 
Brazils, and had considerably increased 


41

43 


his property, Robinson Crusoe deter- 
mined to sell all off, and go to sea 
again as a merchant ; and what trade 
do you think he fixed upon now to 
carry forward on the seas ? — the slave 
trade ! I am sorry to say that he 
resolved to sa.il to the coast of Africa, 
to purchase poor negroes to work in 
the plantations of Brazil. 


44 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


But our restless adventurer was 
soon punished for his incurable dis- 
content, and for his unjust purpose of 
enslaving his fellow men. He sailed 
in a good vessel, with a crew of four- 
teen persons, and such articles of traffic 
as would enable him to purchase slaves 
of the African chiefs. But they had 
not been many days out at sea, when 
a violent tempest arose, such as in the 
tropical seas is called a tornado ; this 
drove them far away from their in- 
tended course, and, indeed, quite out 
of their knowledge ; so that, for twelve 
days they knew not where they were, 
nor whither they were going. Whilst 
they were in this perplexity and terror, 
one of the sailors suddenly called out 
“ liand I” That meant that he could

see land ; but Robinson had no sooner 
run out of the cabin to look out, than 
the vessel struck upon a sund-bank; 
and the motion being thus stopped, 
the sea broke over with tremendous 
violence, threatening every instant to 
wash them all overboard, and to break 
the ship in pieces. At last, they did 
as before, and as is usual in such cases, 
they got the boat down and embarked 
in her, although they had little hope 
that they could thereby escape. At 
length, their worst fears were realised ; 
the fatal wave came which overset 
their boat, and threw them all intu the 
stormy sea ! 


48 


ROBINSON CRUSOi. 


You would now expect an end of 
the story, but that you know if they 
had all been drowned, no one could 
have told about the storm. Yes, one 
was saved, and he got to shore without 
any boat at all. It was Robinson, 
himself, who was thrown out like the 
rest of them ; but so it happened that 
the wave which upset the boat bore 
him on its foaming edge, and at length 
hurled him with violence on the shore. 
He had just time to get on his legs, 
and run higher up, before the next 
wave came, which would have carried 
him back again to the whelming 
ocean. Poor Crusoe had scarcely 
escaped this danger, when he dropped 
nearly insensible from the violence, 
exertion, and fright, he had undergone. 


43

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


51 


When he came to himself, he looked 
up, and thanked God for his wonderful 
deliverance. He was the only one 
saved out of the whole company ; he 
never saw them afterwards, nor any 
sign of them, but three of their hats, 
one cap, and two shoes that were not 
fellows- 

Robinson cast his eyes to the 
stranded vessel, which lay at some 
distance, buffeted by the yet rolling 
sea. It seemed to him a miracle that 
he could have got on shore. 


52 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


So our friend Robinson Crusoe is 
at length landed all alone on an en- 
tirely unknown shore ! What was to 
become of him now — what should he 
do? Can .you tell me what you 
would do in such a case — hunger 
coming on, night approaching, and no 
food or lodging provided ! I rather 
think you would wish yourself at 
hiome again, as there is no doubt 
Robinson did on that occasion. In 
fact, he soon began to think that he 
had but a dreadful deliverance from 
-a sudden to a lingering death. His 
condition was indeed pitiable. He 
was wet, and had no other clothes, nor 
anything to eat and drink, nor any 
prospect but that of perishing with 
famine, or being devoured by wild

beasts. lie had no weapon to defend 
him, or to enable him to procure any 
animal for his sustenance; he had 
nothing about him but a knife, and a 
tobacco-box and pipe, with a little 
tobacco. He walked about in very 
great distress and agony of mind, and 
as night came on, he had nothing for 
it but to climb up into a thick bushy 
tree, out of the way of wild beasts, and 
liere he fell fast asleep. 


56 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


The next morning-, early, Robinson 
awoke in his leafy chamber, and 
rubbing his eyes, wondered not a little 
where he was. Hunger soon reminded 
him that he had had no supper, and 
when he had roused himself completely, 
he could not tell where his breakfast 
was to come from. This was rather a 
serious predicament — worse than sit- 
ting by his father’s fireside at York, 
taking rolls and coffee on a rainy 
morning. 

Before Crusoe descended from the 
tree, he looked out on the ocean. The 
storm had abated, and he was sur- 
prised to observe that the wreck of 
the ship had been thrown higher up, 
and much nearer the shore. This 
gave him some comfort, and he walked 


57 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


5D 

as far as he could towards her, but still 
found half a mile of water between the 
vessel and the land. In a few hours, 
Jiowever, the tide had ebbed out so far 
that he could approach the ship by 
swimming; and, after having paddled 
round it for some tiipe, he at length 
found a bit of rope hanging from her 
side, by which he swung himself up, 
and got on board. Now, he perceived 
that if they had all kept the ship, that 
they would all have been safe, and he 
would have had companions in his 
exile. 


60 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


When Robinson got on board the 
vessel, it was a sad sight indeed. She 
was wedged fast, so that the fore part 
was secured and whole, but the hind 
part was greatly damaged and broken, 
and she was more than half filled with 
water. All the masts, sails, and ropes 
— which are called the rigging — 
w’ere gone. Happily, however, for 
Robinson, he found the provision-room 
but little injured, and the chief of the 
stores remaining good. O with what 
a relish did he devour biscuits and 
bacon, cheese, and salt-fish, and how 
refreshed he was by a drop of good 
wine from the neck of a broken bottle, 
though in his eagerness he sadly cut 
his mouth with the glass ! He found, 
indeed, that he was in danger of in- 


61 



tr-' 














RUBiNSON CRUSOE. 


63 


dulging to excess after his long fast, 
and therefore presently set about 
another kind of employment. He 
knew that his very existence depended 
on his being able to transport these 
provisions to the shore, for his future 
subsistence ; but how was this to be 
done? there was no boat, and the 
remains of the vessel would not hold 
together long, strained as it still was 
by the force of tlie sea and wind. He 
could, to be sure, swim away as he had 
done, and he could put a biscuit or two 
in his mouth; but it was needful to 
hit on some better contrivance than 
that — what do you think it could be ? 


64 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Do you know what a rafl is ? It 
IS a platform of pieces of timber, 
fastened together, and which will 
be sure to fioat, because any single 
piece would float by itself. Now it 
is plain, that if a rafl thus made be 
put on the water, and not overloaded, 
it will answer, in some degree, the 
purpose of a boat; and if a man can 
but keep his place and position upon 
it, he may proceed with it in safety. 
So Robinson set to work ; and, finding 
plenty of broken timber and scattered 
rigging about, he corded a quantity 
together as flat as a floor ; and, having 
tied to it a rope of sufficient length to 
prevent its sailing away, he contrived, 
by the help of lines, and with great 
exertion, to heave it over the ship’s 


65 




ROBINSON CRUSOE.

side. Tiiere was a splash ! So — now 
ihe raft has adjusted itself, and lies 
pretty flat on the water, but bobbing up 
and down with the waves. But Crusoe 
soon steadied it a little with some of 
the seamen’s heavy chests, and with 
casks of provisions, and other things. 
Whilst he was doing this, the tide was 
rising, and he had the unhappiness to 
see his coat and waistcoat, which he 
had left on shore, washed away by the 
sea. However, he found others on 
board the ship; and, having got as 
much on his raft, of provisions, uten- 
sils, tools, arms, and ammunition, as 
it could well sustain, he pushed off; 
and the sea being tolerably quiet, he 
managed to row himself to land. Look 
at him in the print ; there he is, full 
of business, is he not ? 

e2 


68 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson did not g^et to land without 
hazard and diflSculty; for when his 
raft touched the ground, the opposite 
part began to siink in the water, so that 
he and his wares were very nearly 
sloped off into the sea. He just suc- 
ceeded in preventing this, and at length 
got all his goods up high and dry on 
the shore. Oh, how thankful he was ! 
— there was food enough, and other 
comfortable things for a long time to 
come — no thoughts of starving now. 

His next care was to find a place 
of lodging for himself, and of security 
for his goods. So, having piled them 
together as w’cll as he could, he took 
a gun and some powder, and ascended 
a high hill at no great distance. Then 
it was .that he discovered this strange 


69

ROBINSON CRUSOK. 


71 


spot to be an island, for he could see 
the ocean with its waves sparkling all 
round it. The island itself was of 
course not very large, nor was it barren , 
there were woods and grassy vales, and 
various animals skipping about, but 
he could not discover the least sign of 
a human being. Yon see him there, 
on the top of the hill, in the engraving, 
and there arc his casks and chests in 
a heap below. What has he done with 
his raft ? Oh ! there it is, lied to a 
stump driven into the sand ! 


72 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson Crusoe came down from 
the hill, and walked about to explore 
the island further, but was greatly 
afraid of losing sight of his stores. 
So he did not go a great way that day ; 
but when evening arrived, he felt very 
much fatigued with his exertions, and 
began to wush much for some quiet 
lodging, in which he might lie secure 
for the night. However, he could 
find none then, and therefore he 
barricaded himself round as well as 
he could with the tubs< chests, and 
boards ; and having taken his supper, 
passed the night pretty comfortably. 
In the morning, he again looked towards 
the ship, and finding she still re- 
mained, he determined to try and raft 
over as many more things as he thought 


73 



His Raft apse’s. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


75 


would be useful to him ; and, in fact, 
went and came on this errand several 
times, and greatly increased his stores 
on the island. It was not to be ex- 
pected that he should do this every 
time without an accident; on one oc- 
casion, the raft, and all that was on it, 
was upset and washed away, and 
himself narrowly escaped drowning. 
These expeditions were at length put 
an end to as he had expected. One 
morning, when he awoke, after a windy 
night, and looked towards the sea, the 
ship had entirely disappeared; not a 
plank was visible ; all had been borne 
aw’ay by the curling green waves ' 


76 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson Crusoe, though solitary, 
was no longer destitute on his little 
inland. Provisions, drink, clothing, 
tools, materials, arms, gunpowder, and 
shot, with innumerable other articles, 
not excepting money ! he had supplied 
himself with in more or less abun- 
dance. You will ask, of what use 
naoney could be to him in an unin- ^ 
habited island? None whatever, cer- 
tainly ; but he prudently thought that 
if ever a ship came that way, gold 
would be of use again. 

Still Robinson was without a habi- 
tation. He had goods, but no lodging, 
and that was rather awkward ; he was 
also in constant terror of wild, beasts 
issuing from the woods, which might 
eat his provisions, and perhaps himself 


77 



Cuts Notches on his Stick. 





ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


79 


at last. So he considered what ho 
should do, and resolved to erect him- 
self a tent with the sails and cordage 
of the ship, until he could provide 
himself some more secure habitation. 

He found that he should soon lose 
all knowledge of the days, months, or 
years of his present life, unless he kept 
some account of their progress ; so he 
got some long sticks, and cutting a 
notch every day, could at any time 
count them up, and find where he was 
in the year. 


80 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson’s tent would not have 
protected him from the attacks of wild 
beasts, of which he was so much 
afraid, if he had trusted to ropes and 
canvass. To fortify himself to his 
satisfaction, he enclosed it in a ring 
fence, made with stakes driven firmly 
into the ground, and so high as not 
to be mounted by men or animals. 
He would not even make a door for 
himself to enter, lest he should chance 
to leave it open, but used a ladder, 
which he always drew up after him. 
So he was secure, and at the same 
time solitary indeed. Within this 
enclosure, or w’ithin his tent, he 
brought all his various stores and 
useful articles. This spot was close 
under the side of a hill, in which he 
scooped out a cave, which he made 
his cellar.

Now, though this young man was 
for the present in much less distress 
than might have been 'expected, he 
was by no means happy. The thoughts 
of his native land, and the social 
comforts he had forsaken without 
cause, often brought tears into his eyes ; 
and his utter loneliness made him, 
for the most part, melancholy and 
wretched. If he had not been obliged 
to employ himself so much in labo- 
rious occupations required by his situ- 
ation, he might have lost his reason 
altogether. I trust, therefore, that 
none of my young readers will envy 
him, however snug was his tent and 
cave, and although he was a sort of 
monarch over the island he inhabited. 


84 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


It was, according to Robinson’s 
reckoning, the 30th of September, 
1659, when he first set foot on this 
island. At that period, mariners had 
traversed the seas but little, and there 
were countless lands and seas which 
had never apparently been visited by 
men. It would now be rather difficult 
to find a solitary island, or even the 
rocky summit of a mountain above 
the sea, which has not been seen, 
named, and laid down in some chart 
or another. 

Our adventurer did not neglect to 
provide himself with pen, ink, and 
paper, books, and nautical instruments, 
out of the ship’s stores ; and these 
relieved his dulness very much, and 
enabled him to write his history at

earthquake, which made poor Robin^ 
son quake, accompanied by a storm 
which almost tore his tent from the 
ground. 

But a worse misfortune than these, 
and one that alarmed him much more, 
was a dangerous illness, an ague that 
attacked him, and confined him to his 
habitation many days, and which he 
thought at one lime would have ended 
fatally. See how deplorable he looks, 
with no attendants near but his cats 
and his Poll-parrot ! 


96 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


It was some time before poor Robin- 
son recovered his usual health and 
strength ; he could do little but 
wander slowly about, trusting to 
Nature as his only physician. When, 
however, he became quite well, he 
determined to make a more extensive 
survey of the island than he had done 
before ; so he set out one fine morning 
with such provisions as he could con- 
eniently carry. 

Wandering up by the banks of a 
rook, he found many pleasant 
meadows, rich and verdant ; and in 
places were growing many splendid 
plants and flowers peculiar to the 
warm climates. The chief of these 
w’ere aloes, sugar-canes, tobacco-plants, 
and melons. Proceeding further, he 


97 



L 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


99 


came to woods of mahogany and cedar, 
with vines and grapes in abundance. 
When night came on, he climbed into 
a tree as before : and this seems to be 
the safest lodging in those countries 
for travellers on such occasions. The 
next morning he proceeded, and found 
the country still more luxuriant and 
delightful, so that he could not help 
feeling satisfaction at the thought that 
it seemed to be all his own, and that 
without dispute. Robinson travelled 
thus some miles, and at length re- 
turned home laden with delicious 
fruits. 


100 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


But notwithstanding the fruits and 
the animals Robinson obtained, he 
found that he must turn farmer or 
Imsbandman in earnest, if he would 
be sure of a certain store of food for 
the future. So he enclosed a piece of 
ground, dug it up with much labour, 
and sowed the grain in the proper 
season. Do ou know that the climate 
in the torrid zone has only two kinds 
of weather to mark the year, the 
rainy season and the dry : thus it is 
rainy in our spring and autumn, and 
dry during our summer and winter. 
The first time he sowed his corn, he 
lost his crop for want of knowing this : 
the dry season came, and it was all 
parched up, and so perished. I think 
Robinson Crusoe must have been

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


103 


f very well qualified to write a book of 
! trades, he had to undertake so many 
f himself. We find him a sailor, fish- 
i erman, ship-builder, carpenter, farmer, 
: grazier, butcher, basket-maker, pot 
and pan maker, miller, tailor, and 
twenty other things, and king of the 
I country at the same time. All this 
ij was very curious, and it is certainly 
entertaining enough to read about ; 
but Robinson would rather have been 
i engaged in any one of those trades in 
England, and no king at all, than shut 
up in his lone island, with nobody but 
his cats and his parrot to speak to. — 
What do you think of the matter ? 


104 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


We must now inquire more par- 
ticularly how our friend Robinson 
proceeded in some of the employments 
just ment-ioned. — Poor fellow ! he 
tells us that he had no pots or pans 
to put and carry any liquid in, nor a 
basket to take provisions with him on 
a journey. Luckily he found some 
willow-trees, whose long boughs and 
tough twigs enabled him to provide 
himself with baskets both light and 
strong, though not perhaps very neat 
or ornamental. He was more troubled 
to make pots and pans, and would 
have given several pieces of his useless 
gold for a good pitcher and a brown 
dish, such as in England we can get 
for a few pence. However, he set to 
work ; but he says we should botli 


105 





ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


107 


pity and laugh were we to see the 
awkward, mis-shapen things he made 
at first. Why, his pots fell in and 
his pots fell out with their own weight; 
and as for liquors, they all preferred 
' making the best of their way out, to 
remaining confined in such ugly 
i apartments. But at length he found 
j out the method of forming these 
j vessels better, and of hardening them 
I too; for, finding a piece of one of 
[ them which had been in the fire acci- 
I dentally baked as hard as a stone, he 
I took the hint, and building up lighted 
embers round his pots, made them as 
solid as he wished. 


108 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson’s next concern was to 
procure the means of grinding or 
rather bruising his corn, for it was 
neither convenient nor wholesome to 
eat it whole. To construct a mill to 
grind it, was out of the question; 
though I dare say the island had both 
wind and water. It was needful to 
devise some more simple machine, 
and he could think of nothing better 
than a pestle and mortar. He spent 
many a day endeavouring to find a 
great stone big enough to hollow out 
for the purpose, but was unsuccessful ; 
and, probably, if he had obtained one, 
he could not have cut into it. At 
last he procured a block of wood hard 
enough, which he scooped out witli 
fire and labour. It was not very dif-

a heavy knob at the end of the same 
material. There he is, pounding away, 
and quite busy. I am afraid, with 
all his labour, his flour was very coarse 
and husky, so that his bread and 
puddings must have set him coughing 
sometimes. 


112 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Poor Robinson had a laborious time 
of it when he turned carpenter; for 
though he had trees enough, it cost 
him weeks of toil to cut one down ; 
and then to make them into boards 
without a saw was sad fatiguing work 
indeed. He says he was forty-two 
whole days making one long shelf for 
his cave ; for he had to chop each side 
flat with his axe, so that you see one 
tree made but one board ; but a 
sawyer would in half a day have cut 
out twenty or more. But he had a 
more important project in his head 
than making a shelf, or even a house. 
What could it be? — did he wish to 
build a church, or a castle, or a tower ? 
Try and think for him, and imagine 
what it was he desired most of all,

and at all times — yes, more than all 
the comforts which a house replete with 
every convenience could have supplied 
him in his lonely island.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


I SUPPOSE you must have guessed 
by this time that the thing Crusoe 
most desired was a ship, or even a 
boat, to bear him, if not to England, 
at least to some land where there 
were human beings to converse with 1 
Yes, that was what he longed for — 
society. How thankful we ought all 
to be for kind friends and relatives, 
always at hand to aid or cheer us I 
Solitude is the greatest punishment 
almost that can be inflicted on us in 
this life, and so Robinson found it. 

As he walked one day by the sea- 
side, full of these thoughts, he saw 
the large boat belonging to the ship- 
wTecked vessel lying high up on the 
beach, where it had been cast, bottom 
upwards. Now, if half-a-dozen men 


I

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


119 


could but have lent him a hand for a 
few minutes, they would have turned 
it over, and brought it to the sea, so 
as to have floated off at high tide. 
But there was only poor Robinson, 
who, although he got levers and rollers 
from the wood, found that he could 
not move the boat a foot ! Then he 
set himself to dig away the sand 
beneath it; and thus, indeed, he did 
alter the position of the boat, but still 
he was quite unable to move it for- 
ward ; so he was obliged to give the 
old boat up after he had spent many 
days about it. 


120 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


I AM ready to think that it would 
have been better for Robinson to con- 
tent himself as well as he could on 
his island, than to attempt to venture 
out to sea in a boat by himself, if he had 
one ready for his use. But he thought 
differently ; and finding that there were 
no hopes of managing the ship’s boat, 
he resolved to try and make one — 
he that had been seven weeks making 
one single board ! But so intent was 
he on this scheme, tliat he did not 
even reflect on the possibility of con- 
veying the new boat to the sea, from 
the wood where the tree was to be 
felled. He owns that he acted very 
much like a simpleton in all this 
business. However, to work he went, 
and cut down a cedar tree, almost 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


123 


six feet in diameter — that is, in width 
straight across at the bottom. It is 
most surprising' that he could ever 
fall such a tree ! He says he was 
twenty days hewing and hacking at it 
to cut it down ; fourteen more getting 
the top and branches off. Then it 
took him a month to shape the outside 
of the log into something like the 
fashion of a boat, and three months 
more to hollow it out with fire and 
labour. 

So at last his boat was so far finished, 
and it was big enoughj he says, to have 
carried six-and-twenty men ! In fact, 
he was quite delighted with it ; but ^ 
does it not look odd to see him ad- ^ 
miring it so much, lying, as it does, in 
the midst of a wood, not a bit of 
rippling ocean to be seen I 


12i 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson tells us that he was highly 
delighted with his boat: but soon came 
the sad reflection that it was not in, 
nor near the water ; and it happened, 
unluckily, that between the boat and 
the sea there was a hill ! Now he 
had no more power to move this boat 
than the other, and the distance was 
greater. It seems that he never thought 
of that. At first, he tried to cut the 
hill away ; but that was rather too much 
for him, and there was no railway 
company to undertake it. Then he 
thought to dig a canal or dock to let 
the water up to the spot ; and he cal- 
culated that this would occupy him 
ten or twelve years at least, there 
being only two excavators, his right 
hand and his left, to perform the work- 





ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


127 


This he thought was too much to 
attempt, and so he gave up all thoughts 
of launching this boat, which had 
pleased him so-highly at first. When 
he had finished this boat, he had been 
four years on that lonely, unknown 
island 4 


128 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


And now Robinson tells us a little 
of his condition. His clothes were 
nearly worn to rags;* his beard re- 
sembled that of the goats around him ; 
his shoes and stockings were long ago 
worn out, nor had he a hat to his 
head. As to provisions, those ob- 
tained from the ship of course were 
all gone; and what was worse, his v1 
powder and shot, with which he pro- ^ 
cured game, were nearly expended also. 

His ink, too, with which he wrote a 
daily account of his affairs, was almost 
gone; and this want grieved him as 
much as the others, some of which he 
could in a sort of way supply. As 
for clothes, he managed pretty well 
with his goat-skins and threads of the 
same to botch himself up a suit; nay, 


129

131 


more, he made an umbrella of the 
same material to defend him from the 
heat of the sun : and thus equipped, 
our engraving represents him walking 
about his island. 

His chief employments were, culti- 
vating his fields and garden ; gathering, 
curing, and packing his fruits; attend- 
ing his tamed animals; proeuring and 
dressing his food ; with various other 
operations and labours needful in his 
situation. Finding, however, that he 
had still time on his hands, his mind 
strangely reverted to his former design 
of escaping if possible from the island. 


132 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


He therefore set about making a 
much smaller and more manageable 
boat or canoe than the former one, 
and this task he completed success- 
fully in about two years. He made 
a mast and a sail out of the old ship’s 
stores ; and having launched his little 
vessel, was delighted to find that she 
sailed very well. 

In this curious canoe Robinson 
made several short voyages of dis- 
covery about the island, and at length 
resolved to go completely round it 
So he victualled his ship for the 
voyage, putting in two dozen loaves 
of barley bread, an earthen pot full of 
parched rice, a little bottle of rum, 
half a goat, and some powder and shot, 
with mats and skins to shelter him

from the weather. He says that i 
was on the 8th of November, in the 
6th year of his reign, or his captivity, 
that he embarked on this voyage, not 
without some apprehensions of the 
dangers to which he might be exposed. 
He took a sort of leave of his various 
dumb acquaintances at his departure 
from them. See, he is now pushing 
off from the shore ! Take care, Robin- 
son — your bark is but a frail one, I 
fear : — I think you had better keep at 
home ! 


13o 


ROBINSON' CRUSOE. 


Robinson, it seems, would sooner en. 
counter adventuren, and even dangers, 
than have dull ea‘;c and safety. He 
soon found that though the island 
was not large, the ledges of rocks 
about it forced him a good way out to 
sea, and he narrowly escaped being 
throwm upon them. When he had 
passed these, he came to a furious 
current, that is, a driving rush of 
water in the sea, such as you observe 
at the sluice of a water-mill. He was 
now between the rocks and this 
current, which he feared would carry 
away his boat and overwhelm it. He 
continued beating about here for two 
days, unable to return, the wind being 
contrary, and having^ only a choice of 
dangers during that time. Then he 
thought of his quiet hut and cave on 
the island, and the provision and 
other comforts th^re stored up, and 


137 



Sails about the Uland. 


’ > 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


139 


bitterly reproached himself for his 
restless desire of change. He stretched 
forth his hands towards the island, 
and said, ‘‘O happy, happy spot, I 
shall never see thee more i O miser- 
able creature, whither am I going?” 
Now was he being driven into the 
wide ocean, in despair of ever reaching 
the land again. But just as he had 
given himself up for lost, a breeze 
arose towards the island. So on he 
spread his little sail and plied his oars; 
and so in the course of two or three 
hours he regained the island, and 
falling on his knees when he had 
stepped ashore, he devoutly thanked 
Almighty God for this great deliver- 
ance. He laid himself down in his 
cave to refresh his weary limbs, and 
was not a little startled by a voice, 
which said, “ Robinson ! Robinson ! 
where have you been ?” 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


IIU 


-Robinson answered his parrot very- 
kindly, and, perhaps for want of other 
ears, acknowledged to the bird how 
very foolish he had been. He now 
made himself more contented at home, 
and set about improving his condition. 
He made much better chairs and 
tables, pots and pans, baskets, and 
other useful articles, than he had at 
first. Then he determined to increase 
his stock of goats, as his powder and 
shot got low, with which he had pro- 
cured game. So he made pitfalls for 
the wild goats, in w'hich at last 
he caught as many as he required. He 
enclosed for them a spacious meadow, 
and thus could manage them without 
inconvenience. His stock increased 
so, that in about two years he had 


141 




IIOBINSON CRUSOE. 


143 


nearly fifty goats, young and old. So 
he had goat's flesh, and milk, too, 
when he pleased. 

See him now in his cave, sitting 
down to dinner. There is his Poll- 
parrot on one side, looking very 
knowing, his two cats on the other 
looking very loving, and an old dog 
at his feet I wonder what he has 
got for dinner ? I should think goat- 
mutton, roast or boiled, and perliaps 
some of his barley bread boiled in 
milk for a pudding. Should you not 
like to dine with him ? 


144 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson wished very much that 
some one could have taken a sketch 
of him, in his walking-dress, as he 
strolled about the island. He has 
described it so, that the artist has, I 
see, accomplished the task. We will 
explain it in his own words, “I 
had a great, high, shapeless cap, made 
of a goat’s skin, with a flap hanging 
down behind, as well to keep the sun 
from me as to keep out the rain. I 
had a short jacket of goat’s skin, with 
long skirts; pantaloons of the same 
shaggy material ; of which also I had 
socks or buskins, that supplied the 
place of shoes and stockings. I had 
a broad belt, in loops of which hung 
a saw and a hatchet; another belt, 
having a pouch, swung over my

shoulder, in which I kept my powder 
and shot; at my back I carried a 
basket, on my shoulder a gun, and 
over my head a great clumsy thing 
made of goat’s skin, like an umbrella, 
to keep off the sun.” So much for 
the appearance and condition of our 
friend Robinson Crusoe ; we must 
now attend to other things, as new 
events soon opened upon him. “ It 
happened,” says he, “ one day, about 
noon, as I was walking on the shore, 
that I discerned, to my unspeakable 
surprise, the plain impression of a 
man’s foot on the sand I” 


E 2 


143 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson declares that he stood like 
one thunderstruck; he listened, looked 
around, mounted a hill, listened again, 
but could perceive nothing more. At 
length he sped home as fast as his 
legs would carry him, fearing an 
enemy at every turn. He skipped 
over the wall of his enclosure, and 
drew the ladder quietly after him, 
and passed a sleepless night. Now 
again he wished for that undisturbed 
solitude of which he had complained 
before. He wearied his brain with 
conjectures as to who the persons 
could be, whose foot-marks he had 
seen, and whence they could have 
come. He continued in this alarm 
lome days, during which time he 
icarcely dared to peep abroad. When 


149

f-

151 


he did so, he saw nothing of any human 
beings ; but determined to render liis 
dwelling more secure by strengthening 
the fences round his dwelling, and 
thus making them answer the purpose 
of fortifications to his little castle ! He, 
however, passed two years more with^ 
out disturbance of any kind, and the 
fear of enemies began to subside, till 
again his solitude was his chief a-filic- 
tion. 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


15 -^ 


And now poor Robinson thought 
he might venture abroad again without 
apprehension, and wa^ walking near 
the sea-shore as before, when a sight 
presented itself which made his hair 
stand on end with surprise and horror. 
The shore was spread with skulls, 
hands, feet, and other bones of human 
bodies j and there was a hole dug in 
which had been a fire, and these 
human bones, he perceived, had evi- 
dently been roasted at it I Cannibals 
had been there ! What are cannibals? 
I must tell you — they are savage and 
wicked men, who kill and devour one 
another ! Oh, how dreadful is the 
thought! — Now I suppose you no 
longer wish to dwell on Robinson 
Crusoe’s island? Barbarous nations

155 


there were in great numbers, who 
made a constant practice of eating 
their enemies whenever they could 
catch them. Oh, let us be thankful 
that our lot is cast in a happier country, 
where no such horrid doings were 
ever known. I am afraid we must 
not say that the dreadful custom of 
feasting on human flesh is even now 
quite disused in all parts of the world. 


150 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson nearly fainted at the dread- 
fVil sight of these human remains, and 
was in fact made ill by the excess of 
his feelings and disgust. When he 
regained his home, he endeavoured to 
compose himself, and thanked God 
that he had been brought up, not 
with such monsters, but in civilised 
society. He was, however, not quite 
so much alarmed on account of his 
own safety as before ; for, as he had 
lived on the island eighteen years, he 
knew that it was inhabited by no 
human being but himself, and believed 
that the savages only used the spot as 
an occasional retreat, for the purpose 
©f enjoying their inhuman repast in 
greater security. He therefore con- 
tented himself with avoiding generally 


157

159 


that part of the island where the 
savages had landed, and made himself 
as snug and safe as he could in his own 
dwelling ; he loaded his guns and pis- 
tols, and kept much at home : but one 
day, mounting the hill above his cave, 
he plainly perceived a smoke at no 
great distance, and thus it was evident 
that danger was approaching him. He 
peeped through the bushes a little 
further on, and saw nine savages 
dancing round a fire, at which, he 
doubted not, the flesh of human 
beings was then roasting ! In a few 
hours, the savages took to their canoes, 
and then Robinson carefully ap- 
proached the spot they had left The 
remains of their feast were too horrid 
to describe. 


160 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson was now indeed afraid 
that he should one day fall into the 
hands of these dreadful barbarians. 
He, however, passed a year or two 
without seeing any more of them. 
But now a surprise of quite a different 
kind startled him one day as he was 
musing in his cave. It was the distinct 
sound of a ship’s gun ! He started 
up instantly, and mounting the hill, 
looked out to sea, and saw a flash of 
fire, soon followed by the report of a 
second gun. Now he felt convinced 
that there was some ship in distress 
out at sea« — for, do you know, that 
when they are in very great difficulty 
and danger out at sea, and are afraid 
of being wrecked, they fire guns every 
minute, to inform any persons who

L

163 


may be within hearing that help is 
wanted. Robinson made a fire as a 
signal, which was soon answered by 
another gun : he looked out, and 
could just see an object out at sea 
but the weather was too hazy to dis 
cern it distinctly. The next morning 
he looked out again, and then saw 
plainly enough the wreck of a ship 
cast away on the same rocks as those 
on which himself had been thrown 
many years before 


104 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


When the sea was calm, Robinson 
rowed himself to the wreck, and found 
that not a soul on board was left 
alive. He obtained from the vessel 
many articles of which he was much 
in want, and made many voyages for 
that purpose, as he had done before. 

Another year or two passed away, 
and Robinson continued as solitary as 
ever ; but at length it seemed as if he 
was to have company more than 
enough, for he saw five canoes full of 
savages approaching the island ! He 
fetched the telescope which he had 
obtained from the ship, and, climbing 
his hill of observation, he plainly 
discerned about thirty persons sitting 
round a fire, and two apparently 
bound, ready to be killed I One of

167 


these he presently saw, releasing him- 
self from his bonds, dart away from 
his enemies like lightning towards the 
woods. With such amazing swiftness 
did he run, urged by hopes and fears 
for his life, that he left his pursuers 
far behind, and rapidly approached 
the spot where Robinson was standing, 
who now thought it time to interfere. 
He sprang in between the pursuers 
and the pursued, and firing off, first a 
pistol, and then a musket, so despe- 
rately alarmed the savages, who had 
never heard fire-arms before, and who 
saw one of their companions drop 
dead, that they immediately took to 
their canoes, and went away as fast as 
they could ply their oars.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


The young savage who had cscaj^cd 
from his enemies was not less alarmed 
than the rest, and fell flat on his face 
before Robinson, who had much ado 
to soothe him, and to persuade him to 
rise. 

You see this young savage would 
have been killed and eaten in a very 
short time, if he had not slipped his 
cords and run away. He seemed 
very thankful to Robinson, though of 
course he could not make himself 
understood by words ; and, to make 
short of it, Robinson found him a 
very excellent companion and assist- 
ant, when he had taught him a few 
things and a few words of English. 
As it was on a Friday that Robinson 
first saw him, he gave him that name,

and you will hear of him now as his 
man Friday I He was very clever, 
expert, obedient, and attached to his 
master; he soon learned the use of 
European implements, and could shoot 
game with a gun exceedingly well. 
Robinson taught him the principles of 
religion, made him abhor the savage 
practices of his own nation, and, in 
fact, educated him and civilised him 
completely in the course of time.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Robinson and his man Friday 
passed some years together without 
any particular adventure. It was one 
morning in the year, which was the 
twenty-seventh of Crusoe's captivity 
in the island, that Friday perceived a 
number of canoes, full of savages, ap- 
proaching the island. The young 
man was dreadfully frightened, think- 
ing they were come to seek for him 
and eat him up; but Robinson com- 
forted him, and promised to defend 
him. When the savages had sat 
down on the shore, it was soon evident 
that they were come on their old 
errand, and meditated another horrid 
feast. So Robinson and Friday each 
took as many guns as they could 
carry, and determined to put a stop 
to such dreadful proceedings. They 


173 



t

approached as near as they could 
without being discovered, and could 
see plainly about twenty savages 
feasting away, and two wretched ones 
bound, ready to be killed. Then 
Robinson determined to fire their 
guns at the savage men. This they 
repeated until two or three of the 
savages were killed, many wounded, 
and the rest most dreadfully frightened, 
not knowing whence this attack pro- 
ceeded. In great consternation, they 
jumped up, and took to their boats, 
leaving their prisoners still bound on 
the shore. One of these, it appeared, 
was a white man, a Spaniard, who 
jumped for joy at his deliverance, so 
happy and so unexpected. Who do 
you think the other was ? I will tell 
you presently. 


176 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


The other intended victim, thus 
surprisingly released, was an old man, 
at whom Friday gazed at first with 
intense earnestness, and at length, 
rushing towards him, clasped in his 
arms his own father ! It is impossible 
to describe the mutual joy of parent 
and child on tliis occasion. Friday 
danced about him, and showed the 
utmost degree of filial duty and affec- 
lion. He rubbed his benumbed 
hands, brought him drink and food, 
and had the satisfaction of seeing his 
father’s activity at length restored. 
Robinson was scarcely less surprised 
and pleased at this strange event ; and 
now questioned the Spaniard, and 
found that he too had been cast away, 
but not on an uninhabited land. He 


177

had lived some time with the natives, 
when they were attacked and over- 
powered by a neighbouring tribe, who 
took himself and many others pri- 
soners, who would all have been 
devoured had they not been delivered 
by Robinson and his man Friday. 
Very thankful they were for their 
escape, and for the food and shelter 
Robinson gave them. He might 
now indeed call himself a king, having 
subjects three in number, who ac- 
knowledged his authority : but we 
have more events presently to relate.

ROBINSON CRUSOE, 


More visitors now poured in on 
Robinson. One morning, his man 
Friday ran and told him that a canoe, 
such as he had never seen before, was 
in sight, and rowing towards them. 
Robinson soon perceived that they 
were Europeans — yes — and how great 
was his joy to find that they were 
English, too! Yet he had his fears 
that these people could be after no 
good, and there had been no storm to 
injure any vessel. So Robinson kept 
on his guard, and now saw plainly an 
English ship at anchor at no great 
distance. The boat drew to shore, 
the men landed, and bore on their 
shoulders three persons bound as pri- 
soners. Robinson soon found out 
what was the nature of the case, and

being a man of courage, determined, 
if possible, to release these prisoners, 
as he had done the others. Whilst, 
therefore, the sailors were absent, 
ranging in the woods, he and Friday 
approached, and unbinding the men, 
who were utterly astonished at their 
deliverers, bade them defend them- 
selves, and put arms into their hands. 
These three, with Robinson and his 
companions, made seven in all, who, 
finding the sailors in the woods drunk 
or asleep, came on them unawares, 
bound them all with cords, and so 
made them prisoners in turn ! — Was 
not that well done ? 


184 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


I CANNOT describe the surprise and 
alarm of these men at finding tfiem- 
selvcs bound fast, and their prisoners 
released ; but they were obliged to 
submit. The fact is, these sailors 
were mutineers^ — that is, they had 
rebelled against the captain and officers 
of their ship, and had brought thefh. 
to this island for the purpose oL 
leaving them to perish ; but you see 
their violent doings were overruled 
against them. They now implored 
mercy, for they knew they were in 
the power of their officers again, and 
had deserved to die. Their captain 
referred all to Robinson, whom they 
made judge in this business. He 
said he could not promise them what 
he would do fo** two or three days —

then they would find out his inten- 
tions. This was very cleverly ma- 
naged ; for the people in the ship, won- 
dering that their companions did not 
return, sent another boatful to the 
island, leaving only two or three in 
the vessel. When Robinson and his 
men saw them coming, they hid them- 
selves ; and as soon as the men stepped 
ashore, they rushed upon them so 
suddenly, and with such resolution, 
that they mastered them every one, 
and took possession of both their boats. 


ROBINSON CRUSOE. 




Robinson and the captain managed 
matters so well that they got posses- 
sion of the ship, and granted the men 
their lives on condition that the worst 
of them should remain on the island, 
and the others return to their duty, 
and work the ship back to England. 
And so you see Robinson had an 
opportunity of returning to his native 
land at last. He and his man Friday 
took leave of the island, and brought 
the Spaniard away with them. Friday’s 
father went back to his own country, 
and the rest of the English sailors 
took possession of Robinson’s island 
with his permission. He arrived in 
England after thirty years’ absence, 
and found very few of his relatives 
alive. Robinson was so fortunate as

Robinson, some years after, paid his 
island a visit, regulated matters there, 
and again returned to England, where 
he died, at a good old age.
